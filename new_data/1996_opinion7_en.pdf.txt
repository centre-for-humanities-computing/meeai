The  Group  of  Advisers  to  the  European  Commission  on  the  Ethical  Implications  of
Biotechnology (GAEIB),

Having regard to the Commission’s request of 29 September 1992 for an Opinion on Ethics
and Biotechnology for vertebrate animals, including fish,

Having regard to the Commission’s White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, Employment
(December 1993), in particular chapter 5B,

Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, namely the annexed Declaration  n° 24  on
the protection of animals,

Having regard to Council Directive 86/609/EEC regarding the protection of animals used for
experimental and other scientific purposes,

Having  regard  to  Council  Directive  90/220  EEC,  regarding  the  deliberate  release  into  the
environment of Genetically Modified Organisms,

Having regard to  the  European  Conventions of the Council of Europe for the  protection  of
animals  kept  for  farming  purposes  (1976-EST  87)  and  in  particular  the  Protocol  of
Amendment  thereto,  and  for  the  protection  of  vertebrate  animals  used  for  experimental  or
other scientific purposes (1986-EST 123),

Having regard to the United Nations Conventiion on Biodiversity of 6 June 1992, ratified by
the European Union on 25 October 1993,

Having  regard  to  the  hearings,  organized  by  the  GAEIB,  with  experts,  representatives  of
consumers,  patients’  groups  and  pharmaceutical  Industries,  representatives  of  animal  and
environment  protection  associations,  researchers  and  members  of  the  European  Parliament
and of the Council of Europe (21 June 1995 and 20 February 1996),

Having  regard  to  the  report  of  Prof.  Egbert  Schroten  on  the  ethical  aspects  of  genetic
modification of animals.

(cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:3) :+(5($6(cid:3)(cid:29)

1.1 The  Opinion  addresses  the  genetic  modification  of  animals  brought  about  by  DNA
technology, including transfer of genes (transgenesis) and the deletion of genes (“knock-
out”).

1.2 Genetic modification of animals is a developing technology which will add to rather than

replace existing techniques.  It can be used :

• 

In  fundamental  bio-medical  research  to  improve  our  genetic  and  physiological
knowledge;

•  To make models of human diseases;

•  For the production of proteins or other substances for therapeutic aims;

•  As an alternative source of tissues and organs for “xenotransplantation”;

•  To  obtain  or  to  improve  desired  features  of  farmed  animals  including  fish,  such  as

disease resistance and food production.

1.3 In this context, international competition is strong because practical applications are to be

anticipated, both :

•  Medical  (e.g.  models  of  cystic  fibrosis,  production  of  alpha-1-antitrypsin  for  the

treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome);

•  And agricultural (e.g. improved meat quality in pigs, better wool production in sheep,

fish with increased growth rate).

1.4 Man has always been trying to modify nature, for instance by animal breeding.  However,
modern animal biotechnology differs from traditional breeding, more specifically by :

•  The methods used : direct intervention on a micro level (cells, DNA, genes) by highly

sophisticated technologies;

•  The range of the new methods : breaking through species and even kingdom barriers;

•  The speed and precision of such modern technology;

•  The introduction of new objectives : for instance xenotransplantation.

1.5

In our societies, besides the potential benefit we can expect from these techniques, there
are concerns, for example :

•  Harm to animal health and welfare;

• 

Impact on human health;

•  Animals are being used as mere instruments for human benefit and interests;

• 

It is seen as an infringement of animal “integrity” or of the “intrinsic” or “inherent”
value of animals;

• 

• 

• 

It is seen as “unnatural for example because it transgresses species boundaries;

It  is  seen  as  taking  environmental  risks  the  consequences  of  which  are  difficult  to
calculate;

It is seen as a slippery slope towards eugenic applications on human beings.

1.6 Some of these public concerns about genetic modification of animals may be based on
lack  of  information.    They  also  reflect  fundamental  philosophical  questions  about  our
society and the place of science and technology therein, the place of humans in nature,
the relation between humans and animals and in particular the extent to which animals
may be subordinated to human needs.

1.7 The  religious  and  philosophical  approach  of  western  countries  traditionally  gives  a
specific  place  to  humans  in  their  relationship  with  nature  and  animals,  as  humans  are
taken to have a “superior” position.  This approach is shared by most people in Europe
even though  society  has  experienced,  in  recent  decades,  movements  which  advocate  a
more bio- oriented way of thinking.

1.8

In the pluralistic societies of the European Union, a complete consensus on moral and
philosophical issues is not likely.  However, we all may agree that vertebrate animals, as
sentient  beings,  deserve  special  ethical  awareness,  and  that  genetic  modification  of
animals means an increase of scientific power and thus of responsibility.
On the map of these new technologies, the ethical pathways are not yet clearly marked,
which implies the adoption of a policy of prudence.

1.9 The  use  of  genetically  modified  animals  or  products  issuing  from  them,  may  have
potential  implications  for  humans,  which  should  be  taken  into  account,  namely
concerning :

•  Our security as a consumer

•  Our right to be informed

•  The protection of our environment (including biodiversity).

1.10 Since it involves additional ethical issues, the controversial question of legal protection

of genetically modified animals requires a separate opinion.

(cid:21)(cid:17)(cid:3) 68%0,76(cid:3)7+((cid:3))2//2:,1*(cid:3)23,1,21(cid:3)72(cid:3)7+((cid:3)(8523($1(cid:3)&200,66,21(cid:3)(cid:29)

2.1 Genetic modification of animals may contribute to human wellbeing and welfare, but is
acceptable  only  when  the  aims  are  ethically  justified  and  when  it  is  carried  out  under
ethical conditions.

2.2 These conditions would include the following :

•  The  public’s  right  to  protection  against  risks  as  well  as  their  right  to  adequate

information;

•  Human  responsibility  for  animals,  nature  and 

the  environment, 

including

biodiversity;

•  The duty to avoid or minimize animal suffering since unjustified or disproportionate

suffering is unacceptable;

•  The  duty  of  reducing,  replacing  and  when  possible  refining  the  experimentation

adopted for the use of animals in research.

2.3 In  view  of  the  consequences  this  technology  may  have  for  the  health  of  humans  and

animals, for the environment and society, a policy of great prudence is required.

2.4 The scope of this policy should apply to :

•  The making of genetically modified animals;

•  The use and care of these animals;

•  The release of these animals;

•  Putting  genetically  modified  animals  and  their  products  onto  the  market  (including

import/export).

2.5 Concerning these points, licensing bodies in all Member States should have the task of
assessing  research  projects  and  applications  in  the  light  of  the  above  mentioned
principles.

2.6 The task of these licensing bodies would include at least the assessment of :

•  The objectives : transparency and ethical acceptability;

•  The risks : human health, environmental impact;

•  Animal health, welfare and care;

•  The proportionality of means and ends concerning genetic modifications of animals;

•  The quality of these procedures;

•  The possibility of alternatives.

2.7 Great  care  should  be  taken  to  prevent  the  release  into  the  environment  of  genetically

modified animals capable of surviving and breeding in the wild.

2.8 Research  into  the  ethical,  philosophical  and  social  aspects  of  animal  biotechnology
should  be  stimulated.    Research  into  and  monitoring  of  the  possible  consequences  of
animal  biotechnology  for  the  public  and  the  environment  should  be  supported  at  the
European level.

2.9 There should be appropriate and understandable information for the public about genetic

modification of animals and their products.  The European Institutions should strive to :

•  Systematically bridge the information gap;

•  Stimulate the dialogue between research, industry and the public;

•  Create platforms for participation of the public in decision making.

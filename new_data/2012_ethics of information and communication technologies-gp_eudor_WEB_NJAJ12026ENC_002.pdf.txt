Opinion No26

Scope of the Opinion

Every day more than 250 million Europeans connect to 
the Internet, to work, learn, communicate, play and so‑
cialise. But the digital economy, which has grown rap‑
idly around all those activities, poses new challenges 
to governments and regulators. Business models are 
likely to change significantly as Internet access allows 
consumers to compare goods and prices and to shop 
across borders. Work and play will also change dramati‑
cally, as personal interactions continue to change from 
word of mouth and personal meetings to include inter‑
actions unlimited by place or time. Communication and 
mechanisms for interacting with others have already 
changed beyond recognition, and this will almost cer‑
tainly continue at an accelerating pace. The digital rev‑
olution has and will impact on everything people do, 
from their life choices to their health, their shopping, 
their education and the way they communicate. Most 
importantly, national and regional boundaries are be‑
coming, and will continue to become, blurred as a re‑
sult of the speed and accessibility of new technologies.

According to the Digital Agenda,39 fragmented markets 
currently hinder European digital commerce. The lack 
of interoperability between national systems also acts 
as a brake on the development of commerce. Rising 
levels of crime create significant problems in providing 
European citizens with a reliable and safe digital envi‑
ronment that engenders trust. Ideas for mechanisms 
to improve the use of technology across the European 
Union are addressed. The Agenda also recognises that 
‘[T]oday, under EU law, citizens in the EU enjoy a series 
of rights that are relevant to the digital environment, 
such as freedom of expression and information, pro‑
tection of personal data and privacy, requirements for 
transparency and universal telephone and functional 
Internet services and a minimum quality of service’. In 
addition to the impact on commerce, there is a very 
considerable impact on the manner in which we live 
our lives. Technology is likely to impinge on us in both 
positive and negative ways. The Digital Agenda for Eu‑
rope (DAE) emphasises that this should be built into the 
various technologies as they become available.

The impact of the new technologies is so far‑reaching 
that it is impossible to address the vast range of issues 
that are encompassed within the scope of information 
and communication technologies. In accepting the re‑
quest the EGE decided to focus on Internet technolo‑
gies. As the EGE will be examining security issues aris‑
ing from ICT in a subsequent opinion, it will not address 
them in this document. There will be similarities in the 
ethical issues arising from the use of ICT in health, gov‑
ernment, education, agriculture and commerce as they 
impact on society and individuals. The EGE will there‑
fore deal with the ethical problems in general, using 
examples to highlight issues within particular domains. 
ICT in the home and in the interaction of individuals is 
as important as the Internet, and the implications are 
just as far‑reaching. This Opinion should provide sug‑
gestions for an ethically sound use of ICT.

The EGE has decided not to address issues related to 
IPR and ICT even though it is aware of the controversy 
related to the ongoing and future negotiations of the 
Anti‑Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.

On 21 March 2011 President José Manuel Barroso asked 
the EGE to draft an Opinion on the ethical issues arising 
from the rapid expansion of information and communi‑
cation technologies (ICT). President Barroso indicated 
that the Opinion could ‘offer a reference point to the 
Commission to promote a responsible use of the Digital 
Agenda for Europe and facilitate the societal accept‑
ance of such an important policy item.

The EGE is aware of the changes that have come about 
in the lives of most citizens of the European Union, and 
further afield, as a result of the pervasiveness of new 
electronic media. The challenge is to ensure that the 
availability of electronic information and the use of ICT 
are handled in an ethical manner.

Scientific Aspects

1.1 

Introduction

The science of information and communication technolo‑
gies has changed very drastically over the last 70 years. 
The invention of the transistor in 1947 was to herald a rev‑
olution in consumer electronics that was unimaginable 
in previous times. For most of the first half of the 20th 
century thermionic valves enabled radio and radar com‑
munication. The development of computing equipment 
relied on a very large number of transistors. It was minia‑
turisation that led to the massive change in availability of 
electronic devices, and hence in people’s expectations.

As a solid‑state de‑
vice,  the  transistor 
was small, used rela‑
tively  little  power 
(and  hence  heat) 
and  was  the  basis 
for the microproces‑
sor, integrated circuit 
and memory storage 
devices. Whereas the 
valves used in the original computing systems meas‑
ured several tens of cubic centimetres, even the original 
transistors were orders of magnitude smaller. Current 
microprocessors contain millions of transistors on a tiny 
area of silicon.40 Heat is a problem only because of the 
number of individual structures on the die used for 
creating integrated circuits. Today the most advanced 
circuits contain several hundred millions components 
on an area no larger than a fingernail. The transistors 
on these chips measure about 90 nm, you could fit hun‑
dreds of these transistors inside a red blood cell. 

1.1.1  Age of Hardware

Although computers were initially developed during the 
First World War, the personal computer did not become 
available until the 1980s. In less than 30 years, comput‑
ers have changed from number‑crunching, data‑analys‑
ing machines to being primarily communication tools

which are essential to our lives. The first computers were 
impossible to imagine as personal devices. The Harvard 
Mark I, designed by Aiken and Hopper in 1944, was ap‑
proximately 15 metres long and 3 metres tall, weighing 
some 5 tonnes. It contained 7600.00 separate pieces 
and was in use until 1959!41 It was capable of addition, 
subtraction and multiplication and it could store some 
results. Data was stored and counted mechanically 
using 3000 decimal storage wheels, 1400 rotary dial 
switches and 500 miles of wire. Its electromagnetic re‑
lays classified the machine as a relay computer. All out‑
put was displayed on an electric typewriter. By today’s 
standards, the Mark I was slow, requiring 3‑5 seconds 
for a multiplication operation.

The computer on the Apollo missions that placed men 
on the moon had 2000 bytes of memory. It ran at 1 MHz 
and had a total of 32 Kilobits of storage. Today, a mobile 

telephone carried in a pocket may have more than 32 
gigabytes of memory and run at over 1 GHz. Program‑
ming has become complex and depends on an operat‑
ing system (IOS, Windows 7 or Android, for example) 
Programming today involves the interaction of code 
produced by many individuals and teams. There is no 
longer a linear sequence of instructions and programs 
are unlikely to be understood in full by any individual. 
Originally, programmers wrote very basic (or low‑level) 
calls to a micro‑coded ‘hard‑wired’ system. Today, oper‑
ation is dependent on very sophisticated software rou‑
tines that run the computer — the operating system. In 
the early 1970s computer languages were developed 
that provided an interface between the ordinary user 
and the computer. UNIX, for example, was developed

as a toolbox of routines that could be strung together 
to provide required functionality. 42

Computing started off with the storage and analysis 
of information. Nothing was inter‑connected. Mecha‑
nisms were required for providing the computers with 
two input types. Firstly, the programmes that defined 
what were to be done with the data. Initially, this was 
a series of sequential instructions with a mechanism for 
jumping to a different sequence of instructions based 
on tests performed on the data. [This has become 
more sophisticated, relying on sequences of instruc‑
tions based on actions (e.g. the position of a mouse, 
or a mouse click, or input coming from somewhere 
else)]. The second source of information was the data 
to be analysed using these instructions. The two sorts 
of information were kept separate. Mechanisms for the 
output of results were also required. Punched cards 
(Hollerith cards initially) and punched tape were the 
first to be used and were read at a relatively high speed 
by the computers.

Magnetic tape and magnetic discs followed rapidly 
during the latter part of the 20th century. In the 1960s 
teletypewriters were used which provided a coded 
form of information (for either control or data) directly 
to the memory of the computer, there was no contact 
with other machines or other users.

Primary data storage, often referred to as memory, is 
the system that makes data directly available to the 
computer itself. Computers had some memory dedicat‑
ed to the system as well as some memory dedicated to 
the user(s). The system memory consisted of both the 
memory in which programs and data were held and the 
registers used by the computer in which to perform the 
basic operations specified by a program, or linear se‑
quences of instructions. User memory was often sepa‑
rated into (at least) two segments —one that contained 
the program and one that contained the data to be ad‑
dressed and modified by the program. From the early 
1950’s this was some form of magnetic memory that 
could be accessed randomly, as required. Initially these 
were magnetic cores whose magnetic states were al‑
tered by the passage of an electric charge. They were 
replaced by semi‑conductor memory in about 1975. 
The earliest personal computers (circa 1975‑1980) had 
as little as 16 kilobytes of semi‑conductor memory. To‑
day’s home computers have up to 64 gigabytes (4 mil‑
lion times as large) and even mobile phones are likely 

42  http://www.bell-labs.com/history/unix/.

to have 16 gigabytes or more built in. In 1980 a comput‑
er memory board with about 32 kilobytes cost about 
$ 3000, which was a significant sum. Memory was very 
expensive, if relatively fast.

Slower bulk memory was needed for storing large 
amounts of data. If necessary, programs could be 
paged in and out of the faster memory. Initially, mag‑
netic drums were used, followed by floppy disks that 
could hold up to 360 Kbytes of data, and then by floppy 
disks capable of storing 1.4 megabytes of data. Storage 
media in the form of USB sticks and solid‑state memory 
are relatively recent. The main memory for long‑term 
storage remains hard disk drives. They tend to be rela‑
tively slow but can store large amounts of data in an 
easily accessible manner. All these are organised into 
file systems that allow for logical storage of the data 
and the metadata that provides information such as 
ownership, amount of data, date and time of creation 
and of last use, etc.

It is both the size of such memory systems and the 
speed of access that have turned computers into infor‑
mation and communication devices. The real advances 
that have made computers ubiquitous are, on the one 
hand, the software to search through data and allow 
rapid and effective access in real time and, on the other, 
mechanisms to access the data and provide it in a read‑
able form for the user.

1.1.2 

Initial Use of Computers

Initially, computers were used on their own to analyse 
scientific data. In the office, word‑processors, less pow‑
erful than those found today, but with similarities to the 
typewriters they replaced, except that editing was pos‑
sible slowly became ubiquitous. Initially the data was 
stored on removable diskettes and did not even include 
spell‑checkers. As the first word processors did not pro‑
vide a WYSIWYG interface (what you see is what you 
get), the final output depended on the available printers 
and they were, in some ways, more difficult to use than 
typewriters, for codes had to be included in the ‘copy’ 
to indicate formatting (bold, italic, justification etc). 
Spreadsheets quickly replaced numeric calculators, mak‑
ing the job of those working with figures significantly 
easier than it had been. The days of laboriously adding 
up long columns of figures were numbered once per‑
sonal calculators, and then computers, appeared on the 
scene. While the concept of spreadsheets had been used 
for centuries, and similar calculation programs existed 
before, the computerised spreadsheet was probably in‑
vented in about 1978 by Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston.

It was called VisiCalc and was designed for use on an 
Apple personal computer.

The first computer users were primarily scientists, who 
had to do a great deal of their own programming. Com‑
puter languages (either interpreted or compiled) were 
invented to make this possible. Interpreted languages 
were translated at the time of use into code that could 
be implemented by the computer. This had to be done 
each time the programme was used. Compilers took 
the code produced by the programmer and translated 
it into code that could then be used by the computer.

Languages like BASIC were interpreted; Fortran, Al‑
gol, Lisp, C, C++ and Java were compiled. Operating 
systems, which provide routines that can be accessed 
by user programmes for particular purposes were 
‘invented’.

With the advent of systems like UNIX, an Application 
Programme Interface (API) was developed that allowed 
programmes to talk to systems which sat between the 
basic machine and the program produced for a par‑
ticular task. The API is the definition of that which is 
implemented in a library of machine‑specific routines 
that can then be used by those programming without 
needing to take account of the machine on which the 
program is running.

The availability of memory is a major factor in the 
ubiquity of computer devices. As has been indicated, 

in the early years of computing memory devices were 
extremely limited. This has clearly changed, to the ex‑
tent that random access memory costs about € 4 per 
gigabyte. This is the ‘fast’ memory used within the 
computer which enables a range of activities to be un‑
dertaken. Random‑access memory (RAM) is made up of 
integrated circuits that allow stored data to be accessed 
in any order. As RAM is usually volatile, stored informa‑
tion is lost if the power is removed. Slower memory, 
either in the form of semi‑conductors or some kind of 
magnetic disk, is used to retain data over a long period.

1.1.3  The Personal Computer Revolution

In 1980 it was estimated that less than 5 million com‑
puters were in use worldwide. Today it is estimated that 
by 2015 there will be more than 2 billion. In 2010 there 
were over 5 billion mobile phones, which are them‑
selves computers, in use (for a world population of ap‑
proximately 7 billion). The penetration (% of population 
using computers) and quarterly growth of computers 
in 2008 is indicated below.

By 2011, the picture had changed very significantly, 
with major penetration growth in emerging and even 
developing countries. The runaway lead in computer 
technology enjoyed by the United States and Europe is 
no longer as great as it was. The graph below indicates 
penetration — that is, the percentage of the popula‑
tion in each of the regions that has access to ICT.

The situation had also changed markedly in charac‑
ter. Whereas initially personal computers had been 
stand‑alone devices, having little contact with the 
outside world, they had become machines with a great 
deal of ‘intelligence’ but, more significantly, they were 
now connected to the outside world and to each other. 
The major parameters were no longer the speed and 
memory size associated with the machine, but rather 
its connectivity and ability to interact.

1.1.4 

Internet

Towards the end of the last century mechanisms (pro‑
tocols) were developed for machine‑to‑machine inter‑
action. In 1982 the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) was 
standardised and the concept of a world‑wide network 
of fully interconnected TCP/IP networks called the In‑
ternet was introduced. The Internet was commercial‑
ised in 1995.

One of the most important issues that had to be ad‑
dressed before this whole system could take off was 
speed. If the speed of transmission of information had 
remained at the speed at which typing is possible, none 
of the changes to our lives that we have witnessed 
could have happened. Computers which contained 
the critical elements of conditional response — ‘do 
x if y’ — and larger memory, could carry out numerical 
calculation and, in general, many symbol‑manipulation 
tasks. Computer technology has undergone profound 
changes in every decade since the 1940s, in terms of 
both the hardware and the programs which make the 
system usable (and ‘user‑ friendly’).

Computers deal with at least three streams: the set of 
instructions that identify what must be done with any 
data presented to the system; the data that is present‑
ed; and the instructions that identify how to interact 
with other computers or humans.

1.1.5  Age of Software

The mid 1990s saw a large increase in the use of the 
Internet and its impact on our lives. The develop‑
ment of computer operating systems that provided 
an easy‑to‑use interface, such as MSDOS (developed 
by Microsoft) followed by graphical user interfaces 
enabled the general public to use computers in ways 
that initially had not been available. Word‑processing 
packages have had an enormous impact on commu‑
nication, making simple cross‑cultural communication 
possible, for example. Once WYSIWYG43 interfaces be‑
came available, word‑processing software was in use 
everywhere. Companies like Microsoft provided the 
means to kick‑start a revolution in the way people com‑
municate. E‑mail had begun in the early 1980s and may 
have led to the development of the Internet. 

The World Wide Web is now part of our culture. It was 
developed by Tim Berners Lee in 1989 at CERN as a ‘Hy‑
pertext project’ called ‘WorldWideWeb’ as a ‘web’ of 
‘hypertext documents’. It involved a simple system for 
hypertext documents written in English, where angular 
brackets (< and >) separated the text itself from the 
instructions to the computer as to the manner in which 
the text was to be displayed. Initially the web related 
to the text that was to be sent from one computer to 
another. ‘Content is king’ was a popular slogan. The 
simplicity of the hypertext mark‑up language meant 
that the system was accessible even over slow Internet 
lines. The system has changed slightly. The latest ver‑
sions of the language (HTML5 for example) allow for 
much more in the way of web applications than those 
which were initially developed.

Web pages used to be simple, with a single page defin‑
ing both the information and instructions to the brows‑
er (displaying the information in a single file). When 
Amazon’s Chief Executive Officer, Bezos, introduced 
their new e‑book readers in December 2011, he noted 
that most modern web pages, such as Amazon’s own or 
that of CNN, are sophisticated creations, with multiple 
photos, animations, and complex scripts and mark‑up 
code. The CNN home page, for instance, is built by the 
browser from about 53 static images, 39 dynamic im‑
ages, three Flash files, 30 JavaScript files from seven 
different domains, 29 HTML files and seven CSS (Cas‑
cading Style Sheet) files.’ (28 September 2011).

It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet carried only 1 % 
of the information flowing through two‑way telecom‑
munication. By 2000 this figure had grown to 51 %, 
and by 2007 more than 97 % of all telecommunicated 
information was carried over the Internet.

The graphical user interface had a major influence on 
the accessibility of the computer by the general public. 
It is generally understood that it provides some form 
of graphical display of what there is to do, along with 
a pointing device enabling the user to point to and 
choose a particular operation to be performed.

The  availability  of  large  amounts  of  memory  and 
the development of algorithms that enable effective 
searching and cross‑correlating large amounts of data 
have changed our world completely. It is estimated 
that there are 2 billion people using the Internet to‑
day, which is approximately one third of the popula‑
tion.44 The use of portable mobile devices has further 
increased the magnitude of this phenomenon.45 Over 
2 billion people worldwide will own at least one smart‑
phone by 201546 and in the EU the number of mobile 
phone subscribers was around 650 million in 2010.

1.2  The Current Use of the Internet

The way the Internet is used today is very different from 
what was originally designed. The first form of the In‑
ternet was called Web 1.0 and consisted of static pages. 
The consumer was merely a receiver and user of content 
dictated and created by someone else, the producer. 
The producer normally had the technical know‑how as 
a programmer and software developer. The second and 
current state (dating from 2010) is referred to as Web 2.0. 

The distinction between the producer and consumer 
of content has now disappeared. Thanks to new ap‑
plications, any user can create content on the Internet 

44  Figure quoted by William Echikson, Google, during the 

round table organised for this Opinion.

45  A mobile device is a small, hand-held computing device, 
typically having a display screen with touch input and/or 
a miniature keyboard and weighing less than 0.91 kg. Early 
pocket sized ones were joined in the late 2000s by larger but 
otherwise similar tablet computers. As in a personal digital 
assistant (PDA), the input and output are often combined 
into a touch-screen interface. In telecommunications, 4G 
is the fourth generation of cellular wireless standards. It is 
a successor to the 3G and 2G families of standards.

large amounts of personal data from disparate sources 
to be organised and analysed, thereby facilitating the 
discovery of previously unknown relationships among 
the data. A variety of methods, such as probability, infor‑
mation and graph theory as well as artificial intelligence, 
database techniques and classification algorithms, are 
employed to discover interesting patterns in the data.51 

Data mining may be of real significance when databas‑
es collected from many sources are analysed together 
to provide information that is not contained in the in‑
dividual databases. Linking shopping data collected 
through store cards with bank data and/or health data, 
for example, provides insights into an individual’s hab‑
its which may not have been immediately obvious.

1.2.2  Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides computation, software, data 
access, and storage services that do not require the 
end‑user to know the physical location and configuration 
of the system that delivers the services. Cloud comput‑
ing providers deliver applications via the Internet that 
are accessed from web browsers and from desktop and 
mobile apps, while the business software and data are 
stored on servers at a remote location.52 Cloud comput‑
ing is founded on the broad concept of infrastructure 
convergence and shared services. Most cloud‑comput‑
ing infrastructure consists of services delivered through 
shared data‑centres and appearing as a single point of 
access for consumers’ computing needs.

without needing to know any programming languages. 
‘The Internet provides people with the ability to leap 
borders, to disregard convention and to engage in 
unprecedented debate on everything from movies 
to monarchy. Blogs, social networks and online video 
platforms are now widely available for everyone with 
access to the Internet’.47 Nonetheless, there are marked 
differences in the speed of access, depending on the 
part of the world where it is being used. This may 
prevent people living in developing countries from 
accessing information or using computer systems as 
effectively as people living in North America or Western 
Europe. Netcraft’s May 2011 survey reported that there 
were approximately 325 million websites online com‑
pared to 623 websites on New Year’s Day 1994.48 Re‑
searchers at the University of California Berkeley have 
estimated that around 5 exabytes of data were created 
during 2002 across all storage forms (print, film, mag‑
netic, optical). Now, in 2011 — less than a decade later 
— International Data Cooperation (IDC) estimates that 
more than 5 exabytes49 are recorded online every day.

1.2.1  Data mining

Data mining is the process of discovering new pat‑
terns from multiple, large data sets involving methods 
at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine 
learning, statistics and database systems. The goal of 
data mining is to extract knowledge from a data set in 
a structure which humans can understand. It involves 
database and data management, data pre‑processing, 
model and inference considerations, ‘interestingness 
metrics’, complexity considerations, post‑processing of 
found structure, visualisation and online updating. The 
dramatic growth of powerful computing and commu‑
nication technologies enables vast amounts of personal 
information to be collected, stored and used more eas‑
ily and effectively than ever before. Such information is 
generated, knowingly or unknowingly, by individuals 
going about their daily activities: withdrawing money 
from a cash machine, website browsing and online pur‑
chasing, using loyalty cards or even making a mobile 
telephone call.50 Techniques such as data mining enable

the program and data are stored remotely.

Cloud computing has developed since the 1960s and 
since the availability of a significant bandwidth per‑
mitting rapid transfer of data between computers in 
the 1990s. From a user point of view, cloud computing 
means that  users can access their files, data, programs 
and other services via the Internet that are hosted by 
other service providers. Control and responsibility for 
what is stored in the cloud may, however, rest either 
with the cloud provider or the user, and the physical 
location of the data may result in problems relating to 
jurisdiction.

1.2.3 

Internet of Things

The Internet of things (IoT) is an integral part of Future 
Internet, encompassing existing and evolving Internet 
and network developments. It could be defined as a dy‑
namic global network infrastructure with self‑configur‑
ing capabilities based on standard and interoperable 
communication protocols where physical and virtual 
‘things’ have identities, physical attributes, and virtual 
personalities, use intelligent interfaces, and are seam‑
lessly integrated into the information network. In the 
IoT, ‘smart things/objects’ are expected to become 
active participants in business, information and social 
processes. There they are enabled to interact and com‑
municate among themselves and with the environment 
by exchanging data and information ‘sensed’ about the 
environment, while reacting autonomously to events in 
the ‘real/physical world’ and influencing it by running 
processes that trigger actions and create services with 
or without direct human intervention. Services will be 
able to interact with these ‘smart things/objects’ using 
standard interfaces that will provide the necessary link 
via the Internet, to query and change their state and to 
retrieve any information associated with them, taking 
security and privacy issues into account.

According to the European Commission, the Internet of 
things means: ‘Things having identities and virtual per‑
sonalities operating in smart spaces using intelligent 
interfaces to connect and communicate within social, 
environmental, and user contexts.’.53 One important as‑
pect of future Internet is that the Internet will extend 
outside traditional computer devices so that any ob‑
jects in the environment can be connected to it.54 The 

network becomes more powerful when intelligence 
can be embedded in things and processing power can 
be distributed more widely in the network.

The Internet of things (IoT) is usually identified as having 
started in 1999 when the Auto‑ID Centre was established 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Interacting with other machines has become at least as 
important as interacting with people or other comput‑
ers. ‘The Internet of things is about interacting with the 
objects around us, including static non‑intelligent ob‑
jects, and augmenting such interactions with context as 
provided by geo‑location, time etc. Even non‑powered 
devices can be brought into the Internet of things via 
a handset or a smartphone serving as a gateway to the 
Internet. In the case of machine‑to‑machine commu‑
nication (M2M), this involves communicating with ma‑
chines such as energy‑meters or sensors or even your 
refrigerator via IP over wireless or wire.’55 The devices do 
not even have to be intelligent or powered. Near‑field 
communication (NFC) is based on very short‑range ra‑
dio communication technology and NFC‑enabled hand‑
sets are being introduced into the market.

RFID (radio‑frequency identification systems) tags are 
simple. They are able to cause a response in the form 
of a unique number from a (possibly) non‑powered 
tag which, via computers, can then be associated with 
an individual or an individual object to which the tag 
is attached. The reader can be several metres away 
from the tag and not necessarily in line of sight. Tags 
are now being used everywhere, from the identifica‑
tion and sorting of luggage at airports to charging 
for toll roads or for biometric surveillance for security 
purpose. RFID data can be read through the human 
body, clothing and non‑metallic materials. RFID tags 
used with entry systems allow access to specific build‑
ings and allow data concerning the tagged persons or 
objects to be recorded when passing a reader device. 
The Internet of things is considered to be an innovative 
ICT sector. It may be used in the home environment, 
or even in smart health monitoring devices, but there 
are implications in that it can (and is) used to track in‑
dividuals’ movements.

documents/iotprague2009.pdf.

54  Data about things is collected and processed with very small 
computers (mostly Radio Frequency Identifier Devices –
RFID- tags) that are connected to more powerful computers 

through networks. Sensor technologies are used to detect 
changes in the physical environment of things, which fur-
ther benefits data collection.

RECOMMENDATIONS | 10STATE OF THE ART: SCIENCE, REGULATION AND POLICIES | PART A:

1.2.4  Social Networks

A social networking service is an online service, platform, 
or site that focuses on building social networks or social 
relations among people with shared interests or activi‑
ties. Most social network services are web based and 
provide means for users to interact over the Internet, 
such as through e‑mail and instant messaging. Online 
community services are sometimes considered as a so‑
cial network, albeit in a broader sense. A social network 
service usually means an individual‑centred service, 
whereas online community services are group‑centred. 
In the late 1990s, user profiles became a central feature 
of social networking sites, allowing users to compile 
lists of ‘friends’ and search for other users with similar 
interests. By the end of the 1990s new social networking 
methods had been developed and many sites began 
to develop more advanced features for users to find 
and manage friends.56 This newer generation of social 

56  Efforts to support social networks via computer-mediated 
communication were made in many early online services, 
including Usenet, ARPANET, LISTSERV and bulletin board ser-
vices (BBS). Many prototypical features of social networking 
sites were also present in online services such as America 
Online, Prodigy, and CompuServe. Early social networking 
on the World Wide Web began in the form of generalised 
online communities such as Theglobe.com (1995), Geocities 
(1994) and Tripod.com (1995).

networking sites began to flourish with the emergence 
of SixDegrees.com in 1997, followed by Makeoutclub 
in 2000 and Friendster in 2002, soon becoming part of 
the Internet mainstream. Friendster was followed by My‑
Space and LinkedIn a year later, as well as Bebo.

The main social networking services are those which 
contain category places (such as former school year or 
classmates), means to connect with friends (usually with 
self‑description pages) and a recommendation system 
linked to trust. Popular methods now combine many of 
these features: Facebook and Twitter are used extensive‑
ly worldwide; Nexopia (mostly in Canada); Bebo, VKon‑
takte, Hi5, Hyves (mostly in The Netherlands), Draugiem.
lv (mostly in Latvia), StudiVZ (mostly in Germany), iWiW 
(mostly in Hungary), Tuenti (mostly in Spain), Nasza‑Kla‑
sa (mostly in Poland), Decayenne, Tagged, XING, Badoo 
and Skyrock in parts of Europe; Orkut and Hi5 in South 
America and Central America; and Mixi, Multiply, Or‑
kut, Wretch, renren and Cyworld in Asia and the Pacific 
Islands. LinkedIn and Orkut are very popular in India. 

The use of social networks is massive; the magnitude 
of this phenomenon is clearly illustrated by the 2011 
data relating to Facebook. With over 500 million users, 
Facebook is now used by 1 in every 13 people on earth. 
Over 250 million of them (over 50 %) log in every day. 
Over 700 billion minutes a month are spent on Face‑
book, 20 million applications are installed per day and

over 250 million people interact with Facebook from 
outside the official website on a monthly basis, across 
2 million websites. Over 200 million people access Fa‑
cebook via their mobile phone; 48 % of young people 
say they now get their news through Facebook. In the 
space of just 20 minutes, over 1 million links are shared 
on Facebook, 2 million friend requests are accepted 
and almost 3 million messages are sent.57

1.3  The Future Internet

The Future Internet (sometimes referred to as Web 
3.0) is a term describing all the research and develop‑
ment activities concerning the Internet.  A concept that 
distinguishes FI from the current Internet is Semantic 
Web. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines 
Semantic Web as a Web of data. The original Internet 
was designed as a web of documents but the amount 
of information in the networks has grown so much that 
better ways of retrieving and combining it are needed. 
The information can be integrated from various different 
sources and types of data and the type of the relation‑
ships between the pieces of data are defined to enable 

better and automatic interchange. In many respects, 
information has never been so free. There are more 
ways to spread more ideas to more people than at any 
moment in history. And even in authoritarian countries, 
information networks are helping people discover new 
facts and making governments more accountable.58

Perhaps the most important change is that informa‑
tion on the Internet is readily searchable. ‘In fact, the 
potential of search and retrieval of information has long 
been a driving factor in digital publishing, as, indeed, 
it has been a major rationale for the Internet itself. We 
have come to take search and retrieval of information 
for granted, and publishers may overlook this very im‑
portant aspect of digital titles. While it may be merely 
an occasional convenience to see when last a particular 
character had appeared in the course of reading, say, 
a murder mystery, for many types of publishing, the 
significant improvement in the speed and accuracy of 
finding particular information is a big deal.’59

Cognitive networks will also contribute to making 
a more ‘intelligent’ Internet. They perceive current

1.4  Mobile Devices

A mobile device is a small, hand‑held computing device, 
typically having a display screen with touch input and/or 
a miniature keyboard and less than 0.91 kg. Early pocket 
sized ones were joined in the late 2000s by larger but 
otherwise similar tablet computers. As in a personal digi‑
tal assistant (PDA), the input and output are often com‑
bined into a touch‑screen interface60. Enterprise digital 
assistants can further extend the available functionality 
for the business user by offering integrated data capture 
devices like barcode, RFID and smart card readers. 38% 
of Internet users worldwide had a smartphone in the 
second quarter of 2011, according to the results of Insites 
Consulting ‘Social Media around the World 2011’ global 
study about the usage of social media around the globe, 
with 9,000 respondents in 35 countries. Internet usage 
via mobile is quickly becoming as important as Internet 
usage via PC among those who own smartphones, ac‑
cording to research from Google and the Mobile Market‑
ing Association (MMA)61 conducted during the first half 
of 2011 in several countries around the world. 

Over 2 billion people worldwide will own at least one 
smartphone by 2015, with unit sales growing over 
175% from 2010, according to Parks Associates’ fore‑
casts62. Parks Associates indicates that smartphone 
shipments jumped 70% in 2010, with approximately 
500 million users. (Parks Associates, May 2011). Smart‑
phone adoption grew considerably in the US and EU 
markets63 during 2010. 

60 

In telecommunications, 4G is the fourth generation of cellular 
wireless standards. It is a successor to the 3G and 2G families 
of standards. The 4G system was originally envisioned by the 
Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 4G 
systems mobility is provided by the mobile IP protocol, part 
of IP version 6, while in earlier cellular generations it was only 
provided by physical layer and datalink layer protocols.

63  Spain has the highest rate of smartphone adoption of all 
six markets, 37.6%, up about 38% from 27.3% in December 
2009. Spain surpassed 2009 leader Italy in November 2010.  

Smartphone use accounts for 65% of all mobile cellular 
traffic worldwide64, despite smartphone penetration 
running at just 13%, according to Informa Telecoms 
& Media65. The number of mobile phone world sub‑
scribers has doubled in the past five years66. This figure 
is expected to rise by 10% to 5.6 billion in 2011. The 
growth in developing and emerging countries is espe‑
cially strong. According to the most recent data from 
the UN agency International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU)67, more than half the homes in these countries, 
even in rural areas, have a mobile phone connection. 
Landlines are rarely found or not at all.

In the EU the number of mobile phone subscribers is 
expected to rise to around 650 million by the end of 
2010. This is a growth of almost 3 per cent compared 
to the previous year. Nearly a third of these now use 
UMTS. Germany has the most  mobile phone con‑
tracts in the EU: around 111 million by the end of 2010. 

The UK had the fastest year-over-year growth of the six mar-
kets, increasing about 63% from 21% to 34.3% and taking 
third place. The US came in fourth with a 27% adoption rate, 
up about 61% from 16.8% the prior year and in fourth place 
ahead of Germany and France.

64  The US has higher percentages of smartphone users in the 
18-to-24 bracket (16.7% compared to 14.5%) and 25-to-34 
bracket (27.2% compared to 23.6% percent). Meanwhile, in 
EU5, those 55 and older represent 18.1% of the smartphone 
market, compared to 12.6% in the US. In December 2010, near-
ly 47% of mobile subscribers in the US were mobile media 
users (browsed the mobile web, accessed applications, down-
loaded content or accessed the mobile Internet via SMS), up 
about 17% from the previous year, according to other report 
data. comScore says the growth in mobile media usage is 
largely attributable to the growth in smartphone adoption, 
3G/4G device ownership and the increasing ubiquity of un-
limited data plans, all of which facilitate the consumption of 
mobile media. (Marketing Charts, February 2011)

65  http://blogs.informatandm.com/1397/press-release-smart-
phones-account-for-almost-65-of-mobile-traffic-worldwide/

66  The use of mobile communications is increasing far more in 
Asia and South America than in Europe and North America. 
In China, the number of mobile phone subscribers has risen 
by almost 13 percent this year to around 844 million. This 
figure is expected to grow by one-tenth within the next 
year to 930 million. In India, the number of subscriptions 
will go up by 30 per cent to 680 million. In Brazil, there will 
be 193 million connections by the end of the year; a growth 
of 11 percent. Japan is technically very advanced: 96 per-
cent of all mobile communications users already use UMTS.

Internet Governance: International Bodies

2.1.1  The United Nations Internet 
Governance Forum

The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was established 
by the United Nations World Summit on the Informa‑
tion Society69 (WSIS) as a non‑binding multi‑stake‑
holder platform. Since then, it has become the leading 
global multi‑stakeholder forum on public policy issues 
related to Internet governance.

‘Internet governance is the development and applica‑
tion by governments, the private sector and civil socie‑
ty, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, 
rules, decision‑making procedures, and programmes 
that shape the evolution and use of the Internet.’ This 
working definition was taken up in the Tunis Agenda 
for the Information Society, at the United Nations World 
Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in 2005. In

space for all actors on an equal footing. As a space for 
dialogue it can identify issues to be addressed by the

2.1.2  UNESCO: Code of Conduct 
for the Information Society

In 2000 the United Nations Education, Scientific and 
Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) initiated a global de‑
bate on ethics in ICT aimed at stimulating reflection 
and debate on ethical, legal and societal aspects of 
the Information Society. It brings together partici‑
pants from the largest possible number of countries 
representing the widest range of educational, scientific, 
cultural and social environments. The objectives of this 
initiative were to facilitate broader and fairer access to 
information, by elaborating common principles that 
could guide the Member States in the formulation 
of rules governing the application of ‘fair use’ within 
the framework of their national legislation while, pro‑
tecting human dignity in the digital age.70 European 
regional meetings on the ethical dimensions of the in‑
formation society have been organised by the French 
Commission for UNESCO71 in cooperation with UNESCO 
and the Council of Europe. In October 2011 a code of 
conduct for the information society (non legally bind‑
ing) was discussed at the UNESCO General Assembly72.

2.1.3  Organisation for Economic 

Cooperation and Development

The mission of the Organisation for Economic Coopera‑
tion and Development (OECD) is to promote policies 
that will improve the economic and social well‑being 
of people around the world. The OECD’s work on In‑
ternet governance spans several themes, including the 
information economy, information security and priva‑
cy, broadband and telecom, and e‑government.73 At 
a High Level Meeting74 entitled ‘The Internet Economy: 
Generating Innovation and Growth’ in June 2011, the 
OECD developed an Issues Paper (June 2011) outlining

73  The OECD has developed a privacy statement generator, 
building on the OECD guidelines for the protection of pri-
vacy. They regularly publish policy guidelines on Internet 
economy issues and reviews of good governance in informa-
tion society. Additionally, the OECD releases regular statistical 
updates on the future of the Internet economy (June 2011).

some background to the issues discussed at the ses‑
sions of the High‑Level Meeting, including broadband 
access, the role of broadband in developing the Inter‑
net economy, the balance of policy goals to strengthen 
growth and policy‑making principles for an open Inter‑
net. In December 2011 the OECD published a report on 
data protection and trans‑border data flow.75

2.1.4  Council of Europe

The Council of Europe’s expert group on critical Internet 
resources and cross‑border traffic presented its proposal 
for ‘12 principles of Internet governance’ at the 2010 
summit of the Internet Governance Forum in Lithuania. 
A draft Treaty enshrining the principles of net neutrality 
and protecting the Internet from political interference 
was discussed by the Internet Governance Forum but 
not adopted.  According to the drat Treaty ‘Net neutrality’ 
means that the commercial interests of telecommunica‑
tions companies and Internet service providers should 
not affect consumers’ access to the Web. For example, any 
action taken for competitive gain, such as blocking access 
to Skype with a view to selling another Internet telephony 
service, runs counter to the principles of net neutrality. 

The proposal was drawn up by the Council of Europe, 
which has 47 member states and aims to promote hu‑
man rights, the rule of law and democracy in Europe. 
This draft Internet treaty has been likened to the Space 
Treaty76, agreed in 1967, according to which space ex‑
ploration should be carried out for the benefit of all 
nations and guarantee ‘free access to all areas of celes‑
tial bodies’. ‘The fundamental functions and the core 
principles of the Internet must be preserved in all layers 
of the Internet architecture with a view to guaranteeing 
the interoperability of networks in terms of infrastruc‑
ture, services and contents’.

It holds periodic public meetings for the purpose of 
encouraging global participation in its processes. The 
United States has been the supervisor of the organisa‑
tion’s policy decisions since its formation including dis‑
pute resolution over domain‑name ownership or the 
introduction of top‑level domains. In November 2005, 
an agreement was struck between the EU and the US 
to leave the supervision of domain names and other 
technical resources unchanged. On 2 October 2009, the 
United States announced it would end its unilateral su‑
pervision powers over ICANN,78 which remains the body 
responsible for managing Internet addresses worldwide. 

2.2  European Union Policy Regarding ICT

2.2.1  The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE).

According to data prepared by the Global Institute and 
McKinsey’s Technology, Media and Telecommunications 
Practices79 as part of a knowledge partnership with the 
e‑G8 Forum organised by the G20 French Presidency80 
in 2011, Internet‑related consumption and expenditure 
is now bigger than agriculture or energy. On average, the 
Internet contributes 3.4 per cent to GDP in the 13 coun‑
tries covered by the research.81 Most of the economic 
value created by the Internet falls outside the technology 
sector, with 75 % of the benefits captured by compa‑
nies in more traditional industries. The Internet is also 
a catalyst for job creation. Among 4 800 small and medi‑
um‑sized enterprises surveyed, the Internet created 2.6 
jobs for each job lost to technology‑related efficiencies.

81  The United States is the largest player in the global Inter-
net supply ecosystem, capturing more than 30 per cent 
of global Internet revenues and more than 40 per cent of 
net income. It is also the country with the most balanced 
structure within the global ecosystem among the 13 coun-
tries studied, garnering relatively equal contributions from 
hardware, software and services, and telecommunications. 
India and China are rapidly strengthening their position in 
the global Internet ecosystem with growth rates of more 
than 20 per cent. France, Canada, and Germany have an op-
portunity to leverage their strong Internet usage to increase 
their presence in the supply ecosystem. Other Asian coun-
tries are rapidly accelerating their influence on the Internet 
economy at faster rates than Japan. Brazil, Russia and Italy 
are in the early stages of Internet supply (ibid).

In 2011, Europe faced many challenges to its economic 
and social progress including an ageing population 
and growing global competition. With a view to ad‑
dressing those challenges, in March 2010 the European 
Commission launched the Europe 2020 strategy, which 
sets out a vision for achieving high levels of employ‑
ment, a low carbon economy, productivity and social 
cohesion. Seven flagship initiatives were foreseen to 
implement the strategy. The first, which was adopt‑
ed by the Commission in May 2010, was the ‘Digital 
Agenda for Europe’82 (DAE). It defines the key role that 
ICT must play if Europe is to succeed in its ambitions 
for 2020. Below is a summary of the key policies of the 
five‑year plan:

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

create a new single market to remove barriers to 
cross‑border trade and licensing, simplify copyright 
clearance, complete the Single European Payment 
Area and boost the allocation of spectrum to new 
services such as mobile applications;

improve  ICT standard‑setting  and  interoper‑
ability by reviewing the European Interoperability 
Framework;

improve trust and security by tackling cybercrime 
and sexual exploitation and reviewing the data pro‑
tection framework to protect consumer rights;

increase access to fast Internet and aid the roll‑out 
of fixed and wireless networks;

raise the level of digital literacy by promoting 
e‑skills initiatives and inclusive digital services.

smart use of technology and exploitation of infor‑
mation to address major societal challenges such 
as climate change and the ageing population.

This strategy addresses the plethora of ICT applications 
so far identified in the EU, including:

2.2.2  E‑Government

Europe’s E‑Government has developed significantly in 
recent years and is now seen by millions of citizens as 
a tangible reality. The impact of e‑Government is be‑
ing felt by citizens and companies well beyond gov‑
ernment services, with tools such as electronic identity

helping citizens and businesses in everyday activities 
across society. ICT systems have become central to gov‑
ernment processes for delivering services.

The roadmap focuses on a number of priorities, such 
as: 1) making e‑Government inclusive, so that ‘no citi‑
zen is left behind’; 2) genuine efficiency and effective‑
ness in e‑Government (to improve the transparency 
and accountability of government services, increase 
user satisfaction, and lighten the administrative bur‑
den on businesses and citizens); 3) making high‑impact 
services for citizens and businesses more widely avail‑
able, together with electronic procurement services 
for businesses, services for mobile citizens, including 
better job searching across Europe, or social security 
services (for example pension records and electronic 
benefit applications). E‑Government will be critical in 
enabling service providers to take advantage of mar‑
ket opportunities outside their home country, under 
the EU’s Services Directive; 4) putting in place key ena‑
blers to lay the foundations for e‑Government systems 
to work together, and building the connections be‑
tween ICT systems in different public organisations 
and countries.

2.2.3  E‑Commerce

E‑commerce (electronic commerce) means the buying 
and selling of any goods or services on the Internet, 
ranging from flight tickets to garden furniture, news‑
paper subscriptions, ‘apps’ (smart phone applications) 
or music.

The Internet in general and e‑commerce in particular, 
have enormous potential for boosting growth and 
creating jobs. In some G8 countries the Internet has 
accounted for 20 % of economic growth and 25 % of 
job growth in the last five years.83 The Internet only 
accounts for less than 3 % of the EU economy (gross 
domestic product) and only 3.4 % of all products and 
services are sold over the Internet at the present time.

It  has  been  suggested  that  the  development  of 
high‑speed networks today is having the same impact 
as the development of electricity and transportation 
networks had a century ago. Services are converging 
and moving from the physical into the digital world, 
universally accessible on any device, be it a smart‑
phone, tablet, personal computer, digital radio or

high‑definition television. In parallel, the use of ICT is 
opening up an Internet‑based commerce which cov‑
ers many business sectors.84 Key factors involved in 
this phenomenon are: e‑commerce, e‑invoicing and 
e‑signatures. According to Eurostat, on average, 57 % 
of EU citizens ordered goods for parcel delivery using 
the Internet in 2010.85

The e‑commerce Directive,86 which regulates a broad 
range of Internet activities in the EU, is to be reviewed 
to provide businesses and consumers with greater legal 
certainty in a borderless online marketplace. Towards 
the end of 2010 the Commission concluded a public 
consultation on the future of electronic commerce in 
the internal market and the implementation of the Di‑
rective on electronic commerce.87 

On 11 January 2012 the European Commission adopted 
a communication on e‑commerce to address a num‑
ber of issues related to the optimisation of the EU sin‑
gle market for growth and jobs88. The plans propose 
a number of measures including: better access to dif‑
ferent kinds of online services for consumers across the 
EU;89 greater transparency with respect to companies 

84  Only one of the nine ICT applications companies on the 
Financial Times Global 500 list is European; only four of the 
top 54 websites visited across Europe are of European origin.

87  The e-commerce Directive (2000/31/EC) contains rules that 
facilitate the offer of online services in the EU and ensure, 
in the interests of consumer protection, that these services 
meet certain standards. The e-commerce Directive, for in-
stance, determines that online service providers need only 
comply with rules from the country in which they are estab-
lished. The Directive also obliges service providers to place 
their contact details on their websites, and ensures that ad-
vertisements can easily be identified as such. It also sets out 
a ‘safe harbour’ in the form of a liability exemption for online 
intermediary companies if they comply with certain condi-
tions In the second half of 2010, the Commission consulted 
stakeholders on the functioning of the Directive. Despite the 
numerous technological and business developments over 
the 10 years since its adoption, stakeholders consider that 
the Directive still offers a sound and balanced framework for 
the development of e-commerce. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/
LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:en:NOT.

88  http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm.

89  The Commission will: 1) extend the Internal Market Informa-
tion System (IMI) and the Consumer Protection Cooperation 

and prices on the Internet and improved consumer 
protection;90  and  a  more  extensive  availability  of 
high‑speed Internet and improved communication 
infrastructure for more citizens91.

The Commission is focusing on broad aspects of e‑com‑
merce which are inevitably linked to the application of 
the e‑commerce directive, such as online payment sys‑
tems and the efficiency of cross‑border delivery services. 
The Commission agrees with online service providers 
that the current framework of the e‑commerce direc‑
tive and the principle of the limited liability of Internet 
intermediaries in particular, have proven to be of value.

‘Electronic communication and commerce necessi‑
tate “electronic signatures” and related services allow‑
ing data authentication; divergent rules with respect 
to legal recognition of electronic signatures and the 
accreditation of certification‑service providers in the 
Member States may create a significant barrier to the 
use of electronic communications and electronic com‑
merce; on the other hand, a clear Community frame‑
work regarding the conditions applying to electronic 
signatures will strengthen confidence in, and general 
acceptance of, the new technologies.’92

network (CPC) in order to ensure the correct application of 
the e-commerce Directive and of the Directives protecting 
consumers online; 2) quickly implement the European strat-
egy for intellectual property rights, in particular by presenting 
a legislative initiative on private copying (2013) and a review 
of the Directive on copyright in the information society (2012); 
3) report on the outcome of the consultation on the online 
distribution of audiovisual works (mid-2012); and (4) ensure that 
the new rules on selective distribution are rigorously applied.

90  The Commission will also: 1) boost the capacity of the 
Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, which 
consists of national authorities enforcing consumer legisla-
tion and equipping it with instruments able to ensure the 
implementation of relevant legislation at European level; 
2) adopt a ‘European Consumer Agenda’ in 2012, including 
digital issues, which proposes measures to guarantee an ap-
propriate level of information and customer care online; and 
3) ensure the adequate protection of patients purchasing 
medicines online through the application of the directive 
on falsified medicines. This will include contributing to the 
creation of ‘trust marks’ to allow the identification of legal 
distance-selling websites, monitoring the development of 
falsified medicines and examining the potential specific risks 
linked to the online sale of medicines.

91  The Commission will, inter alia, adopt an overall strategy on 

cloud computing (2012).

RECOMMENDATIONS | 10STATE OF THE ART: SCIENCE, REGULATION AND POLICIES | PART A:

2.2.4  Corporate Social Responsibility

In October 2011, the European Commission adopted 
a  new  strategy  on  corporate  social  responsibility 
(CSR)93. It describes how enterprises can benefit from 
CSR while contributing to society as a whole by making 
every effort to meet their social responsibilities. In the 
Commission’s view, enterprises should have in place 
a process to integrate social, environmental, ethical 
and human rights concerns into their business opera‑
tions and core strategy in close cooperation with their 
stakeholders. Important features of the CSR definition94 
are: 1) recognition of the importance of core business 
strategy; 2) development of the concept of ‘creating 
shared value’; 3) explicit recognition of human rights 
and ethical considerations in addition to social, envi‑
ronmental and consumer considerations.

The action agenda put forward for the new CSR policy 
for the period 2011‑2014 covers 8 areas: 1) enhancing 
the visibility of CSR and disseminating good practices; 
2) improving and tracking levels of trust in business; 
3) improving self‑ and co‑regulation processes; 4) en‑
hancing market reward for CSR; 5) improving company 
disclosure of social and environmental information; 
6) further integrating CSR into education, training and 
research; 7) emphasising the importance of national 
and sub‑national CSR policies and (8) better aligning 
European and global approaches to CSR.95 

93  http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ 

corporate-social-responsibility/index_en.htm.

94  This is the first time in 10 years that the Commission has 
changed its definition of CSR. Its previous definition was: ‘a 
concept whereby companies integrate social and environ-
mental concerns in their business operations and in their 
interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis.’ The 
new definition is consistent with internationally recognised 
CSR principles and guidelines, such as the OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises, the ISO 26000 Guidance Stand-
ard on Social Responsibility and the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. It should provide 
greater clarity for enterprises, and contribute to greater 
global consistency in expectations for business, regardless 
of where they operate.

95  The Commission highlights the OECD Guidelines for Multina-
tional Enterprises, the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact, 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the 
ILO Tri-partite Declaration of Principles on Multinational Enter-
prises and Social Policy, and the ISO 26000 Guidance Standard 
on Social Responsibility. The Commission aims to monitor the 
commitments of large European enterprises to take account 
of internationally recognised guidelines and principles. It will 
also present a report on EU priorities for the implementation 
of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 

The Commission has noted that while progress is con‑
tinuing to be made in embedding CSR in the ICT domain, 
only 15 of the 27 EU Member States have national policy 
frameworks to promote CSR. A report on the implemen‑
tation of this action agenda will be published in time for 
a review meeting scheduled for mid 2014. All CSR meas‑
ures previously described also apply to the ICT sector.

2.2.5 

Interoperability and Standards

Interoperability is the ability of computers or digital 
systems to exchange and use information with one 
another.96 If, for example, rival telephone networks 
used completely different protocols it would not nec‑
essarily be possible to connect to others on a different 
network. ‘Interoperability means working together ‑ 
collaboration of systems, services and people. When 
people work together, they need to communicate and 
make agreements. They need to agree on the tasks they 
will perform and how they will exchange results. If their 
nationality is different, they also need to agree on the 
language in which they will communicate. Moreover, 
they need to overcome cultural and legal differences.’97 
The European Commission recently announced the 
adoption of the European Interoperability Framework, 
which has been closely monitored by big ICT firms and 
public administrations to find out what kind of software 
licences they should have.98

2.2.6  Very Fast Internet

The Internet is facing problems as a result of the enor‑
mous growth in content and traffic on the network. 
Moreover, phenomena such as e‑commerce and Inter‑
net banking are struggling with security issues, because 

and develop human rights guidance for a limited number of 
industrial sectors and for small businesses.

96  Lack of interoperability of Microsoft software and servers, 
for instance, was at the centre of an antitrust case brought 
by former EU Commissioner Mario Monti in 2004 when he 
was head of the Commission’s competition department. 
Last June the European Commission launched an antitrust 
investigation into IBM’s mainframe business after two smaller 
companies complained that they could not use the compa-
ny’s operating system without buying costly IBM hardware.

a 2009 White Paper ‘Modernising ICT Standardisation in the 
EU — The Way Forward’. The European Parliament has also 
published a non-legislative report on the future of European 
standardisation.

they were not considered in the design of the original 
network architecture. Although, the European Union has 
seen connection speeds double in recent years, it still has 
a steep hill to climb before it hits the targets set out in its 
Digital Agenda. The Commission is working on a number 
of initiatives to reach the Digital Agenda targets.99 

2.2.7  E‑Skills

The  EU’s  ‘New  Skills  for  New  Jobs’  initiative  was 
launched in December 2008.100 Its premise is that in 
order to provide job opportunities for all and create 
a more competitive and sustainable economy, Europe 
needs a highly‑skilled workforce able to meet current 
and future challenges. In November 2010, the com‑
missioner published a set of proposals known as the 
‘Agenda for New Skills and Jobs’.101 

2.2.8  E‑Advertising

The EU consumer policy strategy 2007‑2013 states that 
‘the technological revolution brought about by the In‑
ternet is paving the way for innovative ways to advertise 
goods and services’. However, it concedes that the same 
revolution also presents challenges to the self‑reg‑
ulation  of  advertising.  Advertisers  have  preferred 
a self‑regulatory approach to their work. A report from 
the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA) 
102 outlines how advertisers regulate themselves.103 In 

99  See the Broadband Package published in September 2010. 
The package also includes a five-year programme to pro-
mote efficient radio spectrum use, encourages public and 
private investment in networks and proposes the inclusion 
of broadband in the EU’s Universal Service requirements 
to increase its take-up. The Commission’s Radio Spectrum 
Policy Programme (RSPP) is currently under scrutiny at the 
European Parliament and in the Member States.

CELEX:52010DC0682:EN:NOT.

102  The EASA represents Europe’s advertising industry by bringing 
together national self-regulatory organisations, or SROs, at Eu-
ropean level. National SROs, which exist in 22 of the 27 Mem-
ber States, differ slightly from country to country, mainly as 
a result of legal and cultural differences between EU Member 
States, but all have the same goal of making sure that advertis-
ing standards remain within an acceptable boundary.

103  As advertisers migrate to the Web, advertising standards 
have attracted attention. In 2008 negotiations between ad-
vertising agencies, associations and national self-regulatory 
organisations produced a Digital Marketing Communica-
tions Best Practice guidebook which is intended to define 

April 2009, the Commission launched the European 
Consumer Summit, inviting leading industry players to 
participate in a consultation on consumer protection 
and privacy in relation to online advertising in Europe.104 

On 1 December 2011, The European Commission joined 
forces with major technology firms including Apple, Fa‑
cebook and Google and agreed to improve the protec‑
tion of children online.105 The coalition, which includes 
28 companies,106 will develop an age‑based online rat‑
ings system and aims to strengthen privacy settings. It 
also plans by the end of next year to make it easier to 
report inappropriate content. Other measures include 
improving parental control and enhancing coopera‑
tion among law enforcement and hotline authorities 
to remove online material showing sexual abuse. The 
EU produced specific guidelines on child pornography 
in December 2003 (Decision 2004/68/JHA)107.

2.2.9  Cybercrime

In the Council of Europe’s Cybercrime Treaty (EST no. 
185),108 cybercrime is used as an umbrella term to refer 
to an array of criminal activity including offences against 
computer data and systems, computer‑related offences, 
content offences, and copyright offences. Other com‑
mentators have suggested that the definition is broader 
and includes activities such as child pornography and 
cyber‑bullying.109 Common cyber criminal activity in‑
volves stealing sensitive information such as credit 
card details, online login credentials, browsing his‑
tory and email addresses. This information can then be 
sold in a vibrant underground economy where credit 
card details can be bought from $0.07 to $ 100, with 

what kind of online content falls under the agreed adver-
tising codes. Nevertheless, EU lawmakers and consumer 
groups continue to question whether these rules are robust 
and transparent enough to address consumer protection 
issues that arise in the online sphere. .

discounts offered for buying in bulk. It has been esti‑
mated that 69 % of adults with an online presence have 
been a victim of cybercrime during their lifetime, which 
equates to one million victims every day. The cost of 
global cybercrime has been estimated at $ 114 billion 
annually; rising to $ 388 billion when financial losses and 
time lost are included.110 In the UK alone, cybercrime 
costs the economy £ 27 billion a year with nearly half of 
the £ 21 billion cost to business being made up of intel‑
lectual property theft.111 Worryingly, the trends for cy‑
bercrime are moving in the wrong direction; the average 
daily volume of web‑based attacks increased by 93 % 
between 2009 and 2010.112 It is unsurprising then that 
the EU Internal Security Strategy lists cybercrime as one 
of the main security challenges facing Member States.113

Europol has pointed to the Internet as a facilitator for 
organised crime.114 The EU’s first significant response to 
cybercrime has been the establishment of computer 
emergency response teams (CERSTS) in every coun‑
try.115 The EU initiative on Critical Information Infrastruc‑
ture Protection (CIIP) aims to strengthen the security 
and resilience of vital ICT infrastructure by stimulat‑
ing and supporting the development of a high level 
of preparedness, security and resilience capabilities at 
both national and European levels. The Commission 
set out a CIIP action plan in its Communication on Criti‑
cal information Infrastructure Protection (COM (2009) 
149). The EU adopted the CIIP action plan on 31 March 
2011. The plan also aims to forge international agree‑
ments on cyber‑security. The EU‑US Working Group on 
Cyber‑security and Cyber‑crime, established during the 
EU‑US Summit of November 2010,116 is an important 
step in this direction. This Working Group, is tasked

with developing collaborative approaches to a wide 
range of cyber‑security and cyber‑crime issues. 

In 2010, the European Commission also presented 
a proposal for a Directive on attacks against informa‑
tion systems and repealing Council Framework Decision 
2005/222/JHA. 117 The Directive seeks to strengthen and 
modernise the already existing rules of the Framework 
Decision adopted in 2005, by including provisions to 
deal with the emergence of large‑scale simultaneous 
attacks against information systems and the increased 
frequency of botnets. The Directive also provides for 
criminal prosecution and more severe criminal sanc‑
tions for perpetrators of cyber attacks.

The EGE will be addressing all these topics in its forth‑
coming Opinion on ethics and surveillance and security 
technologies to be adopted in 2013.

2.2.10  Digital Divide

Under Pillar 6 of the Digital Agenda (Enhancing digital 
literacy, skills and inclusion), the Commission proposes 
a series of measures to promote the take‑up of digital 
technologies by potentially disadvantaged groups, such 
as the elderly, the less‑literate and those on a low‑in‑
come. Improving access for people with a disability is 
another of the policy measures set by the Digital Agen‑
da. An additional part of the e‑inclusion agenda is tack‑
ling the issues of an ageing population, with the help 
of ICT: a better quality of life for the elderly, reduced 
cost of care, and business opportunities in the ‘silver 
economy’. Under Pillar 7 (ICT‑enabled benefits for EU 
society) the Commission will reinforce the Ambient As‑
sisted Living (AAL) Joint Programme to allow older peo‑
ple and persons with disabilities to live independently.

2.2.11  Net Neutrality

As part of the 2009 EU telecoms reform package,118 the 
Commission committed itself to scrutinising closely the

The consultation covers a number of issues such as: 
whether Internet providers should be allowed to adopt 
certain traffic management practices, prioritising one 
kind of Internet traffic over another; whether such traf‑
fic management practices may create problems and 
have unfair effects on users; whether the level of com‑
petition between different Internet service providers 
and the transparency requirements of the new telecom 
framework may be sufficient to avoid potential prob‑
lems by allowing consumer choice; and whether the EU 
needs to act further to ensure fairness in the Internet 
market, or whether industry should take the lead.

2.2.12  Internet of Things

The Internet of things (IoT) is an integrated part of the 
Future Internet. The Commission has published a stra‑
tegic research roadmap119 which states that the vision of 
Future Internet based on standard communication pro‑
tocols considers the merging of computer networks, the 
Internet of things (IoT), Internet of people (IoP), Internet 
of energy (IoE), Internet of media (IoM), and Internet of 
services (IoS), into a common global IT platform of seam‑
less networks and networked ‘smart things/objects’.

2.2.13  E‑Health

European healthcare establishments are facing sub‑
stantial challenges over the next decade, such as sig‑
nificant demographic changes and reduced human 
resources. E‑Health offers the rich potential of sup‑
plementing traditional delivery of services and chan‑
nels of communication to provide enhanced access 
to information, streamlined organisational processes 
and improved quality, value and patient satisfaction. 
e‑Health is popularly defined as ‘health services and 
information delivered through the Internet and related 
technologies’.120 The concept of e‑Health is part of the 
wider umbrella term ‘connected health’. Connected 
health relates to a model of healthcare delivery based 
on the use of technology to provide health care re‑
motely. The areas of e‑Health and connected health, 
therefore, encompass a diverse range of information 
and communication technologies (ICT) employed in 
the health field.121 The development, adoption and

implementation of a broad range of e‑Health applica‑
tions, such as electronic health records, health informa‑
tion websites, e‑prescribing, home health monitoring 
and tele‑health, has the potential to enhance qual‑
ity of care and empower patients to make informed 
healthcare decisions. On a daily basis, healthcare pro‑
fessionals strive to reduce risks and improve outcomes 
for their patients. Health information has a key role to 
play in healthcare planning decisions — where to lo‑
cate a new service, whether or not to introduce a new 
national screening programme and decisions on best 
value for money in health and social care provision. Re‑
ductions in health budgets and competition for limited 
resources require enhanced efficacy and efficiency of 
health services.122 For meeting all of these challenges, 
adequate information and knowledge are required and 
e‑Health applications offer the prospect of acquiring 
information which is accurate, reliable and timely.

The European Commission has supported EU research 
in the field of e‑Health for over two decades and during 
that time it has provided € 1 billion in funding to over 
450 projects.123 Since 2004, the Commission has been 
developing targeted policy initiatives aimed at encour‑
aging the widespread adoption of e‑Health technolo‑
gies throughout Europe. These targeted e‑Health ini‑
tiatives began with the publication of Communication 
COM(2004) 356, i.e. the e‑Health Action Plan 2004‑2010 
(eHAP).124 The aim of the eHAP was to facilitate the EU 
in achieving the full potential of e‑Health systems and 
services within a European e‑Health Area. An Action 
Plan for e‑Health was published by the Commission

e‑Health Action Plan for 2012‑2020 ran from March to 
May 2011 and it is envisaged that the new e‑Health 
Action Plan will be adopted in the fourth quarter of 
2012.126 In 2006 the Commission launched ‘ICT for 
Health and i2010’ as part of the i2010 policy framework, 
which was a new strategy aimed at transforming the 
European healthcare landscape by moving towards 
preventative and patient‑centred health systems.127 
This would provide greater continuity of care through 
the deployment of interoperable e‑Health services 
throughout Europe. e‑Health also represents an im‑
portant aspect of the Digital Agenda for Europe and 
is incorporated into a number of actions under Pillar 7 
ICT for Social Challenges, where the potential of ICT is 
used to revolutionise health services and deliver better 
public services, i.e. through its strategy for ‘sustainable 
healthcare and ICT‑based support for dignified and in‑
dependent living’.128 

2.3  Current EU Regulatory Frameworks for 

Personal Data Protection

The Council of Europe Convention for the protection 
of individuals with regard to automatic processing of 
personal data of 1981 (Convention 108) can be con‑
sidered as the first European legal framework for the 
fundamental right to protection of personal data. The 
principles of Convention 108 were refined in Directive 
95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 24.10.1995 on the protection of individuals with re‑
gard to the processing of personal data and on the free 
movement of such data,129 which forms the cornerstone 
of data protection law within the EU. Social networking 
sites (SNS) and ‘cloud computing’ could also pose chal‑
lenges to data protection, as they may involve a loss 
of individuals’ control over their potentially sensitive 
information when they store their data with programs

hosted on someone else’s hardware. A recent study 
confirmed that there seems to be a convergence of 
views — among data protection authorities, business 
associations and consumer organisations — that risks 
to privacy and the protection of personal data associ‑
ated with online activity are on the increase.130

At the same time, ways of collecting personal data have 
become increasingly elaborate and less easy to detect. 
For example, the use of sophisticated tools allows eco‑
nomic operators to target individuals better, thanks to 
the monitoring of their behaviour. Moreover, the grow‑
ing use of procedures allowing automatic data collec‑
tion, such as electronic transport ticketing, road‑toll 
collecting or the use of geo‑location devices, makes it 
easier to determine the location of individuals simply 
because a mobile device is used. Public authorities also 
use an increasing amount of personal data for various 
purposes, such as tracing individuals in the event of an 
outbreak of a communicable disease, preventing and 
fighting terrorism and crime more effectively, adminis‑
tering social security schemes, for taxation purposes, or 
as part of their e‑government applications.131

All this inevitably raises the question whether the exist‑
ing personal data protection legislation can still cope 
with these challenges fully and effectively. To address 
this question, the European Commission launched a re‑
view of the current legal framework with a high level 
conference in May 2009 followed by a public consul‑
tation until the end of 2009. The findings confirmed 
that the core principles of the Directive are still valid 
and that its technologically neutral character should 
be preserved. 

On 4 November 2010, the Commission adopted a com‑
munication entitled ‘A comprehensive approach to 
personal data protection in the European Union’.132 
This communication was sent to the European Data 
Protection Supervisor (EDPS) for consultation. The 
EDPS identified the four main drivers which determine

the environment in which the review process of the 
Directive should take place. The first driver is techno‑
logical development;133 the second is globalisation134 
and the third is the Lisbon Treaty. In fact under the 
Lisbon Treaty, data protection has gained significant 
importance. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the 
European Union has become binding and Article 8 of 
the Charter recognises an autonomous right to the 
protection of personal data.135 The same right is laid 
down in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of 
the European Union (TFEU),136 which introduced a new 
legal basis for data protection applicable to all personal 
data processing in the private and in the public sector, 
including processing in the areas of police and judicial 
cooperation and common foreign and security policy. 
The fourth and final driver identified by EDPS is repre‑
sented by parallel developments taking place in the 
context of international organisations. There are cur‑
rently various debates focusing on the modernisation 
of the current legal instruments for data protection.137 

133  Today’s technology is not the same as when the Directive 
was conceived and adopted. Technological phenomena 
such as cloud computing, behavioural advertising, social 
networks, road toll collecting and geo-location devices pro-
foundly changed the way in which data are processed and 
pose enormous challenges for data protection. A review of 
European data protection rules will have to address these 
challenges effectively.

134  The progressive abolition of trade barriers has given busi-
nesses an increasingly worldwide dimension. Cross-border 
data processing and international transfers have increased 
tremendously in recent years. Furthermore, data process-
ing is now ubiquitous due to information and communi-
cation technologies: Internet and cloud computing have 
allowed delocalised processing of large quantities of data 
on a worldwide scale.

135  Article 8.1 Charter: ‘Everyone has the right to the protection 
of personal data concerning him or her’. As the protection of 
the individual with regard to the processing of personal data 
is in no way restricted to data concerning the private sphere 
of the individual, the right to personal data protection and 
the right to privacy do not coincide. See on this, Colette 
Cuijpers, ‘A private law approach to privacy: mandatory law 
obliged?’, Scripted, volume 4, Issue 4, September 2007, 312.

136  Article 16 TFEU: ‘ Everyone has the right to the protection of 

personal data concerning them’.

137 

It is important to mention in this respect the current reflec-
tions in relation to the future revision of Convention 108 of 
the Council of Europe and of the OECD Privacy Guidelines. 
Another important development concerns the adoption of 
international standards on the protection of personal data 
and privacy, which might possibly lead to the adoption of 
a binding global instrument on data protection.

Data Protection in the EU has a strong internal market 
dimension. As a result, the Directive’s harmonisation of 
national data protection laws is not limited to minimal 
harmonisation but amounts to harmonisation that is 
generally complete.138 At the same time, the Directive 
gives the Member States room for manoeuvre in cer‑
tain areas, authorising them to maintain or introduce 
specific rules for specific situations. This, together with 
the fact that the Directive ‘has sometimes been incor‑
rectly implemented by Member States’,139 has led to 
divergences among the national laws implementing 
the Directive, which run counter to one of its main 
objectives, that of ensuring the free flow of personal 
data within the internal market. This applies to a large 
number of sectors and contexts, for instance when pro‑
cessing personal data in the employment context or 
for public health purposes. Moreover, the divergence 
in the way the Directive is implemented by the Mem‑
ber States creates legal uncertainty, not only for data 
controllers but also for data subjects, with the risk of 
distorting the equivalent level of protection that the 
Directive is supposed to achieve and ensure. The Com‑
mission’s reports on the implementation of the Data 
Protection Directive 95/46/EC140 concluded in 2003141 
and in 2007142 that the Directive did not succeed in 
achieving its internal market policy objective fully, or 
in removing differences in the level of data protection 
actually afforded in the Member States. Enforcement 
was also identified as an area where improvement 
was needed. To address the question whether exist‑
ing EU data protection legislation can still cope fully 
and effectively with the challenges, the Commission

a revision of the data protection EU law147 to be now 
adopted in co‑decision by the European Parliament 
and the Council. Changes introduced in the adopted 
Commission proposal include:

•	 A reinforced ‘right to be forgotten’: people will be 
able to delete their data if there are no legitimate 
reasons for retaining it. 

•	 Wherever consent is required for data to be pro‑
cessed, it will have to be given explicitly, rather than 
assumed, as is sometimes the case now. 

•	

There will be increased responsibility and account‑
ability for those processing personal data.

•	 People will be able to refer cases where their data 
has been breached or rules on data protection 
violated to the data protection authority in their 
country, even when their data is processed by an 
organisation based outside the EU.

•	

EU rules will apply even if personal data is pro‑
cessed abroad by companies that are active in the 
EU market. 

2.4  Gaps or Deficits in Regulations 

and Policies

The previous sections describing the history, current 
state of the art and foreseeable future regarding ICT on 
the one hand, and governance and regulatory frame‑
works on the other hand, have shown that there are 
a number of ICT areas, both well‑known and new, that 
involve challenges for individuals and societies. In the 
next part of the Opinion a number of ethical concerns 
will be described both in general terms and with respect 
to a number of different topics where ICT is especially 
relevant. The debate on ethics and governance of ICT is 
complex and needs to address a wide range of consid‑
erations, values and principles, such as: autonomy; iden‑
tity; privacy and trust; responsibility; justice and solidarity. 

Part B of this Opinion elaborates on these ethical con‑
siderations. Gaps will be identified where the group has 
identified a need for further action in the form of public 
communication, research, education, technological so‑
lutions or regulatory measures.

Ethical Aspects

Information and Communication Technologies have 
not only dramatically changed personal behaviour, 
life styles and interpersonal relationships, but also 
the perception and the notion of society itself and the 
information that may be collected about individuals 
with or without their consent. Technological changes 
also affects routine aspects of modern societies such 
e‑administration, e‑commerce, e‑health, e‑education, 
telework and e‑voting, telephone communication, po‑
litical activities, consumers’ rights, private (intellectual) 
property, democracy etc.. 

In order to provide an analysis of the ethical concerns, 
the EGE has drawn on the ethical framework of the Eu‑
ropean Union, as stated in the Lisbon Treaty and the 
European Charter of Fundamental Rights.148 The EGE 
has grouped the ‘ethical concerns’ regarding ICT under 
the four headings of:

1.  a person’s identification using ICT, and the develop‑
ment and/or continuous re‑interpretation of one’s 
personal identity, in the media made available by ICT; 

2.  the changes of the social sphere, particularly con‑
cerning social relations, culture, education, environ‑
ment, and e‑governance;

3.  the new possibilities of political participation and 

practices of citizenship using ICT; 

4.  the sphere of e‑commerce. 

The following chapters will address the specific implica‑
tions of different uses of ICT. They will also refer to some 
EU legislation and policy actions while not pretending 
to address all the possible legal or policy issues. 

3.1  Challenges to the Concept of Identity

3.1.1 

Introduction

Since the introduction of digital communication, ‘the’ 
Internet has been associated with the dream of limit‑
less communication, creativity, new forms and formats 

148  The principles are quoted at the beginning of the Recom-

mendation Part. 

of social relationships bridging time, place and space. 
The metaphor of the ‘global village’ romanticized the 
new ‘space’ as a ‘space without borders’, and even 
more so, as a common sphere where individuals share 
their private lives, build up new networks, and create 
a new understanding of the social sphere in transcend‑
ing the conceptual separation of the public and the 
private. But, there are nice dreams nonetheless. The 
digital era and the digital ways of self‑expression and 
communication raise new questions and a reconsid‑
eration of many ‘traditional’ ways of protecting individ‑
ual rights while maintaining the freedom and security 
of societies and individuals. 

Online games, social networks, blogs and new mar‑
ketplaces have become crucial factors in determining 
an individual’s identity or identities (and avatars) They 
change the way everyone, including children and ado‑
lescents develop their identity and maintain relation‑
ships, and often the younger generation educates the 
older generation about the ways use of the Internet 
may combine very different skills to ‘design’ one’s iden‑
tity rather than just ‘to have’ it. 

‘Wrzuciła zdjęcia na Facebooka 
i wyleciała z pracy’

A female student – Joanna ‑ worked at a day care 
center for handicapped children as an assistant 
to a teacher.  Somebody has discovered her pho‑
tographs on Facebook (one of them showed her 
with bare shoulders, other in bathing suits) and 
reported to a director, who gave Joanna an order 
to remove the photos. Joanna insisted that there 
is nothing wrong with the photos but promised to 
block access to them. She consulted with a lecturer 
in professional ethics who was of the opinion that 
the photos did not pose any problem. She blocked 
access leaving the note: ‘best regards to a whistle‑
blower who forced me to block my photos’. Eventu‑
ally, she got fired from her job. A director for public 
media from a company dealing with the presen‑
tation of institutions on the web warned against 
leaving the texts on social portals. The employers 
check whether the portals do not contain materials 
adversely influencing a company’s image which can 
result in a termination of employment.

RECOMMENDATIONS | 10EGE OPINION | PART B:

3.1.2  The Digital Identity

Scholars from the fields of developmental biology, 
psychology, sociology and philosophy have begun 
to look into the ways that identities are shaped and 
changed in the era of digital self‑expression and com‑
munication.149 The changes, these scholars claim, will 
be radical, modifying many ‘traditional’ concepts that 
have structured our way of giving the world we live 
in, and our own lives, meaning. One concept that has 
attracted attention is the so‑called digital identity.150 
Mostly, the digital identity approach addresses ques‑
tions of authentic identification, i.e. the identification 
of a person in the Internet, and the challenge of trust: 
For example, in digital interactions the partners need 
to ensure that their signatures are valid and belong 
to those who use them; not only must credit card or 
bank account uses be secured but the whole process 
of online shopping, for example, has to rely upon 
the trust that we provide what is ours, and that the 
recipient handles our ‘identity’ and any information 
provided with care. 

In addition to commercial transactions, social net‑
works demand an ‘authentic’ name of their users. 
Hence, the digital traces left during one’s actions 
require trust, care, and respect for the other’s pri‑
vacy, property or even dignityon both sides. These 
requirements adhere implicitly or explicitly to moral 
values and norms that up to the present have not been 
spelled out sufficiently. While the digital identity with 
respect to commerce is now being regulated, the 
broader question of identity‑as‑identification, as is the 
case with ‘faked identities’ in networks, games etc., 
needs to be further addressed — and not necessarily 
only from a legal point of view.

3.1.3  The Concept of Personal Identity  

in the Digital Era

While literature on the ‘digital identity’ is growing, new‑
er research has shown that it is not enough to analyse 
identity questions in terms of those matters that mostly 
concern the identification of a person rather than his or 

her identity as a person (philosophy distinguishes be‑
tween identity of the same — idem — and identity of 
the self — ipse).151 

Individuals welcome ICT because they expect or ex‑
perience new ways to realise their freedom, and they 
share their social identity with others. The informal 
social forms of communication – over time and over 
space: certainly enhance traditional ways of expression 
and communication. 

‘Writing simultaneously online gives me an added 
sense of interactivity and a feeling of proximity. 
I go as far as sacrificing my early morning sleep 
to get up and go online with friends in Greece 
who  are  seven  hours  ahead.  My  mornings  are 
dedicated to writing online and sending emails 
while drinking my coffee. Early mornings have 
become the favourite part of my day and early 
classes seem to disrupt my daily interactive ritual.’ 
(Stacey)

‘I think I actually need to use the Internet on a daily 
basis in order to maintain all of my relationships 
with  people  that  are  currently  established.  If 
I don’t “instant message” or e‑mail my girlfriend 
on a daily basis, she will get worried about me be‑
cause that is our main method of communication.’ 
(Matt)

Furthermore, many people use ICT to explore new 
ways of creative imagination, using different kinds of 
expression, such as visual tools and graphics, films, or 
social games. If the human being is to be conceived 
as ‘homo ludens’, the ‘playing animal’, exploring him‑
self or herself in creativity, ICT offer many opportuni‑
ties in that respect.152 However, individuals, especially 
children and adolescents, are exposed to so many op‑
tions that they need to be educated in a ‘reflective’ 
and responsible use of ICT including the use of text 
messaging and ‘twitter’. One new problem created by 

149  Cf. for an overview K. Rannenberg, Royer, D., Deuker, A., ed. 
The future of identity in the information society. Challenges 
and opportunities (Berlin: Springer, 2009).

150  This term embraces the different ways a person manages 
himself or herself in the world wide web, i.e. with respect 
to digital signatures, accounts, traces, etc. Cf. among others 
Phillip J. Windley Digital identity, 2005. .

151  For an overview, cf. Paul Ricoeur, Oneself as another (Chicago: 

University of Chicago Press, 1992).

in order to train their employees on specific points, in 
putting them in professional situations.

Ethics of information and communication technologies10 | RECOMMENDATIONSPART B: | EGE OPINION

ICT from a psychological perspective is, for example, 
cyber‑addiction.153

This first area of ethical concern that needs to be ad‑
dressed in further research is what we call the change 
in the personal and social identity. Being shaped and 
shaping one’s identity in the digital era means, for 
example, that a person’s self‑perception is likely to 
change when identity markers such as age, gender, 
ethnicity, language and culture do not constrain indi‑
viduals in creating their social identity. When engag‑
ing in social relationships on the web, individuals can 
choose and actually create new identities, from the use 
of pseudonyms to the invention of whole characters in 
online communities. Offline and online identities may 
vary radically, although both aspects are integrated in 
one self‑concept. While the new narrative construction 
of identity may well be experienced as liberation from 
social ascription, it changes the very nature of our per‑
sonal identities, and as such it needs to be addressed.

‘We should not forget that interactive media are 
based on a computer, which is not a human being. 
We can write e‑mails to friends, buy online without 
entering a store, chat with unknown people, maybe 
fall in love with unknown people all without moving 
from our chair. We can even forget about the outer 
world, the real one. All this, though, is very different 
from a real chat with a friend, a day of shopping, and 
a first date. This is, as far as I am concerned, the big‑
gest risk about the spread of interactive media: losing 
contact with the world around us. We must not for‑
get that a computer will never be able to replace per‑
sonal relationships. After all, we all need to interact 
with real people and places. The emotion that derives 
from facing such masterpieces as La Gioconda could 
never be replaced by the most detailed virtual tour 
of the Louvre. In the same way, a real hug or smile 
will always transmit emotions that are impossible to 
feel through an apathetic computer screen.’ (Sophia)

153  A recent study analyzes the fine line between adolescents’ 
self-assurance and self-exploration via ICT, and addiction. It de-
fines Internet-addiction in the following way: ‘In terms of time, 
an Internet addiction is commonly defined (Beard &Wolf, 2001; 
Young, 1998) as use of the Internet for at least 38 h each week. 
In the current study, based on participants’ self reports about 
their daily use of the Internet, it seems that 6% of these adoles-
cents meet that criterion. This rate fits evaluations made among 
other samples of adolescents world-wide (Cao, Su, Liu, & Gad, 
2007). Cf. Israelashvili, M., et al., Adolescents’ over-use of the cy-
ber world – Internet addiction or identity exploration?, Journal 
of Adolescence (2011), doi:10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.07.015

The fluid self: The effect on the concept of personal 
identity has been described in the context of social 
studies that examine the de‑centred self, together with 
a certain tendency of the ‘fluidity’ of modern social re‑
lations.154 The digital self, too, can be described in this 
line of thought. Its relevance for ethical reflection lies in 
its impact on the traditional concepts of ‘authenticity’ 
and ‘autonomy’: fluid or hybrid identities may threaten 
the consistency and continuity that has been consid‑
ered to be crucial for the concept of a practical identity, 
which ultimately relies upon a self that may not only 
identify with his or her actions but is also identified by 
others. Hence, the new possibilities for shaping one’s 
own identity, constrained only by the features and rules 
of the programs one uses, make social relationships po‑
tentially insecure; ethical concepts such as trust, truth‑
fulness or reliability may lose their function to create 
spheres of belonging — while at the same time enforc‑
ing short‑term relationships that can easily be replaced. 

In face‑to‑face relations, the ‘creative’ construction of 
identity is constrained by social perceptions that enable 
the persons involved to compare actions and statements 
with what they see and hear, or the knowledge they all 
share. The cyber‑identity may be completely disconnect‑
ed from such ’embodied’ interactions, and even in cases 
people where engage ‘authentically’ in social networks, 
the lack of a shared location or space outside the web 
changes the way in which this new form of authenticity is 
spelled out. This not only raises the question of how the 
web‑identity can be integrated in one’s overall identity 
concept, but the ‘fluidity’ may also threaten the tradi‑
tional understanding of autonomy as sovereignty. One 
consequence of the erosion of ‘fixed identities’ is that ac‑
countability for one’s actions has to be newly spelled out.

Identity and ICT devices: On a different level, ICT blur 
the distinction between the concept of an embodied 
self — a self that has a body and at the same time is 
embodied — when several body parts are replaced 
by computer‑controlled devices, and the concept of 
inter‑personal interaction, when, for example, robots 
are designed to care for human beings, as,for exam‑
ple, with care for persons suffering from dementia, or 
persons with disabilities. Though there are many good 
reasons to introduce these devices as complementary 
ways to attend to people’s needs, the emotional re‑
sponses create new interactions and new forms of at‑
tachment that need to be scrutinised.

Wireless technology can be extended to wear‑
able devices to monitor people 24h a day both 
inside and outside the house. Items of jewellery 
such as bracelets and watches worn by Alzheimer 
patients can be GPS‑enabled and can identify the 
location of the individual if they get disoriented 
and wander off. The bracelet/watch automati‑
cally detects any departure from a security zone, 
which is pre‑determined by the patient’s family 
or caregiver. More recently, wireless technologies 
are allowing doctors and carers to continuously 
monitor the health status of the elderly person. For 
example the smart shirt is a wearable T‑shirt which 
consists of integrated wireless sensor nodes de‑
signed to collect physiological data such as heart 
rate, electrocardiogram results, respiration and 
temperature. This information can then be trans‑
mitted wireless to a base station along with the 
geo‑location of the wearer which can be accessed 
by health care providers.

Alerts can be generated in response to signs of 
clinical deterioration thereby allowing for early 
intervention. Robotics has been recognised as a 
technology of potentially key importance in help‑
ing the growing elderly population with day‑to‑
day tasks as well as communications with family 
members. Robots which can aid in feeding, dress‑
ing, bathing and reminding older people to take 
their medication are already in use. Beyond the 
service robot, new developments in the field of 
human‑robot interaction are aimed at alleviating 
loneliness, and assisting in cognitive function. The 
National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science 
and Technology in Japan have developed ‘Paro’, 
a robotic baby seal which stimulates behaviour of 
a real pet and is used to provide companionship 
for those with dementia. Interaction with a ro‑
botic dog resulted in cognitive gains, specifically 
increased communication in older subjects with 
dementia. Information and communication tech‑
nologies are also being utilised to encourage social 
interaction in older populations who may have re‑
duced mobility and fewer opportunities for social 
contact. In 2007, 41.2% of women and 19.5% of 
men aged over 65 were recorded as living alone in 
the EU, thus videoconferencing and 3D calls using 
hologram technology will become increasing im‑
portant in supporting older people in maintaining 
their social links with family and friends, thereby 
reducing a sense of isolation and exclusion. 

Ambient Assisted Living and the Elderly

Europe is facing a significant social and economic 
challenge, brought about by an unprecedented 
demographic change. Projections by EUROSTAT 
estimate that by 2060, 30% of all EU citizens will 
be over 65 and the number of people over 80 will 
more than double from 5% to 12% over the same 
period . While gains in life expectancy are to be 
generally welcomed, such gains have important im‑
plications for health and long‑term care systems in 
Europe. As a result of our ageing population, it has 
been projected that healthcare spending will rise 
by between 1% to 2% of the GDP in most Member 
States in the period 2008‑2060; an increase of ap‑
proximately 25% of current spending levels. In ad‑
dition to the increased costs of caring for our older 
family members, there is the added complication 
of fewer carers available. By 2060, there will be two 
persons aged 15 to 64 for every person aged 65 or 
more, compared with four persons to one in 2010. 
Thus, many Governments have become active in 
supporting innovative ICT solutions to assist in the 
delivery of high‑quality cost effective health and 
social care provisions. For example, the European 
Union has an action plan on ICT and Ageing, which 
aims to support active ageing. The emergence of 
new types of mobile and embedded computing de‑
vices, developments in wireless technologies and 
smart sensors, provide the tools to develop innova‑
tive applications to assist older people to maintain 
or improve their quality of life and to facilitate their 
desire to live independently in their own homes . 
Smart homes address the promotion of independ‑
ent living by using assistive technologies for higher 
quality of daily life, which aims to maintain a high 
degree of autonomy and dignity of the older per‑
son. Smart homes are typically equipped with a 
large amount of networked sensors which collect 
lifestyle pattern data, which are analysed regularly 
and the patterns recorded thereby building up a 
picture of the user’s everyday activities. If a devia‑
tion from the normal pattern is detected e.g. not 
getting out of bed, an alert is issued to the user and 
in the case of no response, the alarm is raised via an 
automatic telephone message. Sensors can also be 
linked through an intelligent network to cut‑off de‑
vices which can enhance safety of the occupant(s) 
e.g. if excessive heat is detected in the kitchen, the 
stove is automatically switched off.

The potential gains in autonomy and independ‑
ence for older people, which can be harnessed 
through ICT is not without its’ challenges. Despite 
significant decreases in the cost of computing over 
the last 20 years, introductory costs of technolo‑
gies described above are relatively high. This raises 
the issue of e‑inclusion and whether it is possible 
to ensure accessibility to all user groups. In addi‑
tion, research has shown that older people are 
reluctant to adopt technical solutions facilitating 
independent living. This is related to a number of 
issues, including the complexity of using the tech‑
nology, the cost, the lack of perceived usefulness 
and the stigmatisation of not being considered ca‑
pable of caring for oneself. Heretofore, work in the 
ambient assisted living area has been largely con‑
cerned with technical feasibility; there is however 
a growing recognition that a more user‑centred 
model is now required. 

Ethical questions relating to privacy and dignity 
also  need  to  be  addressed.  While  continuous 
monitoring of homes and human activity can of‑
fer a safer environment for older people, many are 
wary of constant surveillance and the lack of control 
over data collected. Solutions proved to overcome 
these concerns include collecting and processing 
data on a local level, with the data being shared 
only if an emergency situation is detected, at which 
point the information could be released to health‑
care workers and/or carers. The situation is more 
complex in the care of older people with cogni‑
tive impairments who may not be in a position to 
participate in the decision making process around 
privacy settings. 

Technical solutions should not violate an older 
person’s dignity and it is critical that ICT serves 
to augment, rather than replace, human interac‑
tion. Concerns have been expressed that depend‑
ence on assisted living technologies could further 
serve to isolate older people, eroding their social 
connectedness. In the field of robotics there have 
been warnings that the presence of robots in the 
home could risk leaving the elderly in the care of 
machines without sufficient human contact. These 
essential questions will be considered in the con‑
text of the EU Ambient Assisted Living Joint Pro‑
gramme which runs from 2008‑2013.

Identity and time: Traditionally, identity is not only 

considered ‘embodied’ in the way described above, 
but also as identity over time. In the ‘digital identity’ 
concept, this concerns questions of identification. But 
in the broader perspective, the whole concept of iden‑
tity‑over‑time may change considerably: On the one 
hand, time becomes an unreliable source of identifica‑
tion: statements, images or entries in social networks 
may well be taken as quasi‑present representations of 
a person’s self‑image, while they may in fact be only 
a fragment of the past that a person would not con‑
sider important for his or her contemporary way of 
thinking or living. The distinction between synchronic 
communication and diachronic narrative is, therefore, 
easily blurred when entries or profiles are stored for 
a potentially very long time, and can be used by others 
outside of their original context. 

Facebook now allows its members to store a life story 
and  hence  structure  their  entries  in  a  diachronic 
manner. Memory and forgetting are complementary 
concepts for personal identity: without some forget‑
ting and the necessary selection process in giving 
meaning to one’s identity, the creation of an identity 
of the self (ipse) becomes more and more depend‑
ent on the socially ascribed ‘markers’ of identification 
(idem). As has been stated with respect to the legal 
initiative of the ‘right to be forgotten’, however, the web 
seems to ‘never forget’.155 The ethical question with re‑
spect to identity concepts, then, is how it affects one’s 
self‑relation and social relations alike over time — there 
are signs that the impossibility of ‘deleting’ a part of 
one’s life story from the collective memory of the web 
may create an unforgiving culture, either with respect 
to employment or social forms of shaming, or with re‑
spect to surveillance policies.156

155  Cf. Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, Delete: the virtue of forgetting 
in the digital age (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2009). 
The group acknowledges that the term the ‘right to be for-
gotten’ is used to call attention to this difficulty of the traces 
a person leaves without being able to delete them. Neverthe-
less, the term as such seems unfortunate as it easily alludes 
to the forgetting of a person, which is contra to its intention.

156  As an example, Mayer-Schönberger tells the story of a wom-
an who was denied immigration to the US because it could 
be proved that she had taken drugs in her adolescent years. 
Adults by now regularly warn their adolescent children 
about the images they post on facebook, because future 
employers scan the Internet for purposes of informal profil-
ing. The unforgetting memory of the Internet thus can easily 
be ‘unforgiving’.

RECOMMENDATIONS | 10EGE OPINION | PART B:

Identity theft is one of the most prominent forms of 
cybercrime. Techniques such as phishing and pharm‑
ing are used, luring users to fake websites which look 
legitimate, and where users are asked to enter their 
personal information. This could include e‑mail ad‑
dresses, username, passwords, credit card details and 
other information criminals can use to ‘steal’ another 
person’s identity. This information can then be used 
online to open bank accounts, apply for loans and 
buy goods. Due to the insidious nature of the crime, 
victims may not become aware of the fact they have 
been targeted until the impact becomes severe. In 
2010, Albert Gonzales, the ringleader of a group of 
hackers, was sentenced to 20 years in a US court for 
the theft of 130 million credit and debit card details 
from US retailers, used for fraudulent transactions 
resulting in $200 million in losses.

As public awareness about the dangers of identity 
theft increases, so too does the sophistication of the 
phishing techniques employed. There have been re‑
ports of cyber criminals exploiting the goodwill of 
people in response to natural disasters. Following 
the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, emails purporting to 
be from charities directed donors to fake websites 
where donations made using credit cards were de‑
posited in accounts controlled by criminal entities.

3.1.4 

Individual Identity and Social Identity in ICT.

The second area the EGE considers as requiring further 
examination is the impact of ICT on the relation between 
individual identities and social communities and group 
identities. While scholars easily agree that individuals 
develop values and convictions in relation to others, 
Internet platforms and social networks may also rein‑
force group identities. When people can — and will — 
choose between different sources of information, and 
when companies profile their consumer habits, the two 
practices combined easily enforce a selective perception 
of the ‘world’ as it is presented in the Internet. As a result, 
the individual’s social horizon is actually narrowed.

Another example of an ethically important change 
in the relation between the individual and the social 
sphere is the way in which social networks shape the 
concept of friendship and community — when one can 
easily have hundreds of ‘friends’ in a social network 
with whom one barely shares more than a loose sense 
of belonging to the same Internet community, one of 
the most important moral institutions, the personal 

relation and interaction between individuals who know 
each other, share interests and shape personal respon‑
sibilities, is radically re‑interpreted.157 

The British Medical Association alerts to the ethi‑
cal‑professional problems coming from the use to 
TWITTER.

And FACEBOOK advising medical doctors on the 
risks of having patients and ‘’friends’’ in Facebook 
and  Twitter  mainly  informal  commentaries,  ex‑
change of patient’s photos, discussion regarding 
their professional work especially with sensitive data.

Furthermore, ICT may easily ‘mainstream’ social pat‑
terns, beginning with the languages used to communi‑
cate, through to cultural patterns such as gender roles 
(even though these may be actualised by persons of 
another sex), and social norms of various kinds. Ethi‑
cally speaking, the Internet creates the space not only 
for creative social relations but also for new collective 
identities that are gained or maintained by re‑introduc‑
ing forms of inclusion and exclusion. Disrespect and 
discrimination of ‘other’ groups would then be an ex‑
treme and blameworthy form of ‘identity politics’ that 
potentially threatens any collective identity.158 Here 
criminal practices like explicit discrimination or ‘hate 
speech’ must certainly be addressed by international 
cooperative legal regulations but regulation will not 
prevent practices of social stigmatisation.

3.1.5  The Concept of Moral Identity in ICT Domains

The third area the EGE wishes to highlight with respect 
to individual identity concepts is the concept of moral 
identity. Moral identity entails the interpretation of ac‑
countability for a person’s actions on the one hand, and 
the integration of moral values in one’s identity. For the 
European Union, this means that the European values 
need to be communicated to the citizens, and interpret‑
ed in view of ICT, as in a first step suggested in this EGE 
Opinion. For example, what should count as a responsi‑
ble use of personal data from the perspective of the indi‑
vidual is not easily determined on the one hand, when 

157  Aristotle addressed friendship as mutual care between equals; 
as such it has been conceptualised frequently throughout 
the history of moral philosophy and moral theology.

158  This is not specific to ICT communities and group identities; 

however, ICT evoke new forms of such identities.

42

Ethics of information and communication technologies10 | RECOMMENDATIONSPART B: | EGE OPINION

on the other hand, companies continuously expand 
the means to profile citizens and use multiple initially 
unlinked databases for this purpose (cf. Part One of this 
Opinion, Data mining), and countries are not transparent 
about their surveillance practices.159 Many people make 
data available for what is thought to be one purpose 
ignoring or not realizing that they have implicitly or even 
explicitly agreed to specific marketing strategies that are 
used for completely different purposes.

Moral identity, however, involves more than protecting 
one’s own rights with respect to others or the state; 
it also concerns the responsibility for a ‘decent’ civil 
cyberspace. Bullying of individuals in social networks 
will not disappear through legal regulation; individuals 
need to step forward and protect others against bul‑
lying, but they also need to know how to act in such 
cases. Since in principle everyone is vulnerable to dis‑
respect, the EGE emphasizes that the Internet is not an 
ethically neutral sphere but a sphere of social interac‑
tion that necessarily creates values and norms, so that 
much effort must be put in communicating the Euro‑
pean values and normative principles of action, from 
the respect of dignity and rights, to non‑discrimination 
and particular protection of vulnerability. 

Cyberbullying

The ease of access to powerful communication tools 
such as social networking sites, email and internet 
enabled smart phones are allowing young people 
to connect with each other and engage with society 
in ways previously unimaginable. Parents report that 
75% of 6‑17 year olds in the 27 EU member states 
use the internet, and 63% of children own a mobile 
phone. This increases to 94% in the 15‑17 year old 
group. Sixty percent of 9‑16 year old internet users 
in Europe go online on a daily basis, spending an 
average of 88 minutes online that increases to 118 
minutes on 15‑16 year olds. Thus, engaging in social 
media constitutes a routine activity for our children 
and research has shown that there are many positive 
benefits including enhanced communication and 
technical skills. At the same time, we are witnessing 
how the anonymous, instant and far‑reaching com‑
munication capabilities have afforded young people 

159  As the group has stated in the beginning of this Opinion, 
the EGE does not address questions of security but will turn 
to this in a later Opinion.

an opportunity to harass and intimidate each other. 
While bullying is not a new phenomenon, the ways in 
which it happens are changing. Several definitions of 
cyberbullying can be found in the literature, Patchin 
and Hinduja define cyberbullying as ‘wilful and re‑
peated harm inflicted through the use of computers, 
cell phones and other electronic devices’. Essentially, 
cyberbullying involves sending threatening messag‑
es (by text or e‑mail), posting derogatory comments, 
or circulating false rumours on social networking 
sites. Cyberbullies can use a variety of online settings 
to physically threaten or intimidate their peers. Cy‑
berbullying differs from traditional bulyying in that 
it can take place outside of school and on a 24hour, 
seven day a week basis due to the accessibility of the 
internet and mobile phones. This kind of bullying can 
reach a wider audience and has a permanence not 
normally associated with traditional bullying (posts 
on social media site can be difficult if not impossible 
to remove). Cyberbullying also offers the perpetrator 
anonymity which engenders a confidence to commit 
hurtful acts. Easily maintaining anonymity in cyber‑
space has been found to be one of the triggers of 
cyberbullying. Without any direct contact with vic‑
tims or any feedback, cyberbullies may have difficulty 
appreciating the magnitude of harm their actions are 
causing, and have fewer opportunities for empathy 
or to express remorse. 

Recent research has attempted to establish the prev‑
alence of cyberbullying amongst children and teen‑
agers and findings suggest that approximately 10‑
35% of students have been victims of cyberbullying. 
Ina recent UK study, 18.4% of young people between 
10 and 19 reported that they have been bullied by 
perpetrators using the internet or mobile phone. The 
EU kids online study which interviewed 25.000 Euro‑
pean children across 25 countries documented that 
6% of 9‑16 year olds have been bullied online. While 
there is disagreement about whether one or other 
sex is more likely to be involved in cyberbullying, and 
the age of cyberbullying, there is a significant over‑
lap between being a victim and being perpetrator. 
A common finding in studies is that the majority of 
victims do not tell and adult about the difficulties 
they are experiencing. This has been attributed to 
the fact that many parents are not as digitally savvy 
as their children and there is a fear amongst young 
people that in response to such reports, parents will 
withdraw their internet/phone privileges. Cyberbul‑
lying is an issue of which many parents are aware

3.2  Privacy as a Fundamental Right

In the 1950s, Hannah Arendt was one of the first schol‑
ars to observe the political importance of privacy.160 
Arendt’s defence of the importance of the private 
sphere warns about dangers arising from the erosion 
of the private, a situation which some consider as deriv‑
ing from the use of ICT as communication tools. 

Ethically speaking, respect for freedom of the one per‑
son raises not only the question of violation of rights of 
another person but also the possibility of violating the 
person’s own dignity. For example, if individuals decide 
to share their own private and intimate moments with 
the web community (think of recording and putting 
on the web explicit sexual images), can we say that 
their actions are ethically wrong because others may 
consider them detrimental to human beings’ dignity? 
The advocates of freedom of expression would argue 
for the broadest possible notion of freedom of expres‑
sion and autonomy, but they would have to contend 
with, for example, free circulation of extreme porno‑
graphy (sadomasochism, sex brutality, etc.) by consent‑
ing adults.161 The opponents of this radical liberal ex‑
pression of individuals’ autonomy would, on the other 
hand, face arguments on censorship, on the ethical 
justification for the limitation of individuals’ freedom, 
and the scope or limit of respect of ethical pluralism. 

When individuals decide to share data that concern their 
own private sphere, their decision affects not only their 
own freedom but has implications, too, for all other us‑
ers. As the example of online sex and/or pornography 
easily shows, a very ‘liberal’ interpretation of digital free‑
dom may change the concept of sexuality, may shape 
social practices concerning sexuality, the body, gender 
norms, or the concept of beauty. The opportunities that 
technologies, especially in connection with the Internet, 
provide, may easily result in the erosion of privacy and, 
over time, also change the notion of social norms or the 
overall concept of the public sphere. Even though strik‑
ing a balance between different rights, and the balancing 
of rights and social goods, is very difficult, linking the 
‘individual’ rights to the impact on the community of 

160  Hannah Arendt, 1958, The Human Condition, University of 

Chicago Press.

161  Different is the debate on the ethics dimension of privacy 
protection for individuals not consenting to the sharing of 
their own data. But in this last case, the absence of individuals’ 
consent rises questions related to subjects’ right to self-de-
termination and autonomy and then are ethically sensitive.

and concerned about. According to the 2008 Flash 
Eurobarometer survey, 54% of European parents are 
worried that their children could be bullied online, 
with 61% reporting that they stay close by in order to 
monitor their child’s usage of the internet. 

Victims of cyberbullying exhibit signs of emotional 
distress, low self esteem, depression and anxiety. 
These children complain of headaches and stomach 
aches more frequently than children who are not 
cyberbullied.

Victims report being frightened to attend school, 
leading to concerns that school absences will inevi‑
tably lead to a detrimental effect on academic per‑
formance, which could have life‑long consequences. 
In extreme situations, cyberbullying can contribute 
to cyberbullicide, a recently coined term to refer to 
suicides influenced directly or indirectly by this form 
of bullying. There have been several high profile 
cases reported in the media of young people tak‑
ing their own lives, in part because of harassment 
and mistreatment mediated through the internet. 
Cyberbullies themselves have also been shown to 
have low self‑esteem, are anxious, have difficulty in 
making friends; all risk factors for suicide. 

Efforts aimed at counteracting cyberbullying range 
from legislation to awareness campaigns. Twenty‑five 
states in the US have enacted specific cyberbullying 
legislation, with seven states classifying cyberbully‑
ing as a crime. This approach has been criticised by 
some commentators, as it is clear that many cyber‑
bullies are suffering emotional distress themselves 
and labelling them as criminals is unlikely to be 
helpful and may impact on their future educational 
progress. Education of young people, their teachers 
and parents is though to be crucial in the prevention 
of cyberbullying. An important first step is to enable 
young people to explore their attitudes to what con‑
stitutes appropriate and inappropriate content to 
share. Education can enforce social norms about how 
young people engage with their peers in cyberspace 
i.e. in a respectful manner. Our children also need to 
be advised about categories for reporting incidents 
of cyberbullying and how to safely use the internet. 
To this end, the European Commission launched the 
Safer Internet programme 2009‑2013, with the aim of 
empowering young people online by providing them 
with the information, skills and tools to deal with risks 
they may encounter in this virtual world.

Ethics of information and communication technologies10 | RECOMMENDATIONSPART B: | EGE OPINION

Internet users is an important step in assessing Internet 
governance. In this specific context, liberal versus more 
restrictive governance models are being proposed in the 
global debate over the ethics of Internet and the rights/
values of individuals as citizens of the cyber‑community.

Privacy has been conceived as an ‘exclusion’ device — 
as a tool to fend off the ‘unwanted gaze’. However, by 
analysing the definitions of privacy it is clear that priva‑
cy has changed over time by giving shape ultimately to 
a right that is increasingly geared towards enabling the 
free construction of one’s personality — the autono‑
mous building up of one’s identity, and the projection 
of fundamental democratic principles into the private 
sphere. A societal and academic debate has been taking 
place for some years now on the notion of privacy.162 

Some argue that privacy is a means of controlling infor‑
mation that should commonly be shared since in the web 
2.0 e‑privacy cannot properly be defended. This view, 
called ‘post‑privacy‑movement’, also advocates that ac‑
tively giving up privacy would determine the flourish‑
ing of a personal and social virtue163 based on people’s 
freedom to introduce and share whatever data on their 
own lives they desire, including sexual behaviour/pref‑
erences. Also according to this view, such an approach 
should encourage people to cultivate more tolerance to‑
wards attitudes and behaviour of others. The opposite 
view states that the assumption that in the web 2.0 era it 
is difficult to guarantee privacy is not a sufficient reason 
to abandon the necessary protection of individuals’ pri‑
vacy. It states that a private sphere is a source where one 
is not required to immediately meet public expectations 
and conventional lifestyles. The two positions character‑
ise the debate on both Internet governance and issues 
related to personal integrity and social communication.

3.2.1  Concerns Regarding the Current EU Legal 

Protection of Personal Data

According to a recent Eurobarometer (IP/11/742), 70% 
of Europeans are concerned that their personal data 
may be misused. They are worried that companies may 
be passing on their data to other companies without 

162  Cf. the Flash Eurobarometer 241 on ‘Information Society as 
seen by the EU citizens’ (2008) and SPECIAL Eurobarometer 
359 ‘Attitudes on Data Protection and Electronic Identity in 
the European Union’ (2011).

163  Other codes of conduct strictly distinguish between using 
public data (and making them public where this is deemed 
to be necessary) and, at the same time, protecting private 
data; cf. http://www.ccc.de/hackerethics.

their permission. 74% of Europeans think that disclos‑
ing personal data is increasingly part of modern life, 
but at the same time, 72% of Internet users are worried 
that they give away too much personal data, according 
to the Eurobarometer survey. They feel they are not in 
complete control of their data. This erodes their trust 
in online and other services and holds back the growth 
of the digital economy in general. 

In the context of ICT development there is, therefore, 
a widespread public perception of significant ethical 
risks and legal uncertainty associated notably with on‑
line activity.164 This is why it is time to build a stronger 
and more coherent data protection framework in the 
EU, backed by strong enforcement that will allow the 
digital economy to develop across the internal market, 
put individuals in control of their own data and rein‑
force legal and practical certainty for economic opera‑
tors and public authorities.165

3.2.2  Safety of Personal Data

Increasingly, individuals upload their own personal 
data to the Internet166 (social networks, cloud com‑
puting services, etc.). However, the European Directive 
on the protection of personal data does not apply to 
the individual who uploads data for ‘purely personal’ 
purposes or ‘in the course of a household activity’ (the 
so‑called ‘household exemption’).167 Arguably it does 
not apply either to the organisation that provides the 
service, i.e. hosts and makes available the information 
uploaded by the individual (unless the service pro‑

ent is a data controller.168

3.2.3  Profiling and Data Mining

A consequence of the broad and flexible concept of ‘per‑
sonal data’ is that there are numerous cases where it is 
not always clear whether individuals enjoy data protec‑
tion rights and whether data controllers should comply 
with the obligations imposed by the Directive. There are 
situations which involve the processing of specific infor‑
mation which would require additional measures under 
EU law e.g. key‑coded data, location data, ‘data mining’.169 
‘Profiles’, when they are attributed to a data subject, even 
make it possible to generate new personal data which 
are not those which the data subject has communicated 
to the controller. This future development of ‘new data’ 
(through data mining and profiling) should be taken into 
account when revising the Directive.170

3.2.4  Sensitive Data

The processing of sensitive data, i.e. ‘personal data re‑
vealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, reli‑
gious or philosophical beliefs, trade‑union member‑
ship, and data concerning health or sex life’, is currently 
already prohibited as a general rule, with limited excep‑
tions under certain conditions and safeguards (Article 8 
of the Directive) However, in the light of technological 
and other societal developments, there is a need to 
reconsider the existing provisions on sensitive data, 
to examine whether other categories of data should 
be added and to further clarify the conditions for their 
processing. This concerns, for example, genetic data 
and biometric data,171 which are currently not explic‑
itly mentioned as a sensitive category of data.172 In or‑
der to guarantee lawfulness, personal data should be 
processed on the basis of the consent of the person

concerned. Consideration could be given to broaden‑
ing the situations where express consent is required, cur‑
rently limited to sensitive personal data.173 However, it 
is doubtful whether the legal framework should require 
explicit consent as a general rule for all types of pro‑
cessing operations, including those currently covered 
by Article 7 of the Directive.174 The controller should 
have the burden of proving that the data subject has 
given consent to the processing operation.175

3.2.5  Giving and Withdrawing Consent

It would provide more legal certainty if the data pro‑
tection legislative framework were to contain an ex‑
press clause entitling an individual to withdraw their 
consent.176 The same requirements including unam‑
biguous consent apply both offline and online. As the 
risk of ambiguous consent is likely to be greater in the 
online world, this calls for specific attention. Unam‑
biguous consent does not fit well with procedures to 
obtain consent based on inaction or silence on the part 
of individuals: a party’s silence or inaction has inher‑
ent ambiguity. As a consequence of the requirement 
for consent to be unambiguous, data controllers are 
de facto encouraged to have in place procedures and 
mechanisms that leave no doubt that consent has been 
given, either on the basis of an express action carried 
out by the individual or by being clearly inferred from 
an action carried out by an individual. As a matter of 
good practice data controllers should consider putting 
in place relevant measures and procedures to show 
that consent has been given. The more complicated the 
environment in which they operate, the more measures 
will be necessary to ensure that consent is verifiable. This 
information should be put at the disposal of the data 
protection authority upon request.177

Ethics of information and communication technologies10 | RECOMMENDATIONSPART B: | EGE OPINION

In the online environment explicit consent may be given 
by using electronic or digital signatures. However, it 
can also be given through clickable buttons depending 
on the context, sending confirmatory emails, clicking 
on icons, etc. Consent does not have to be recordable 
to be valid. However, it is in the interest of the data 
controller to retain evidence. Obviously, the strength 
of the evidence provided by a specific mechanism may 
vary, supplying more or less evidence of the consent. 
Consent that has been obtained through a clickable 
button with the identity of the individual supported 
by an email address only will have much less eviden‑
tiary value than a similar process, for example with 
recordable consent mechanisms. The need for strong 
evidence will also depend on the type of data collected 
and the purpose followed: an electronic signature will 
not be needed to consent to receiving commercial of‑
fers, but may be necessary to consent to the processing 
of certain types of financial data online.178

Consent does not provide a valid ground where the 
individual has no genuine and free choice and is subse‑
quently not able to refuse or withdraw consent without 
detriment, especially when there is a clear misbalance 
between the data subject and the controller, e.g. in the 
employment sector. In this case, processing needs an‑
other legitimate basis, laid down by law.179

3.2.6  Transparency

Transparency is a fundamental condition for enabling 
individuals to exercise control over their own data and 
to ensure effective protection of personal data. It is 
therefore essential that individuals should be well and 
clearly informed, in a transparent way, by data control‑
lers about how and by whom their data are collected 
and processed, for what reasons, for how long, how it 
will be shared with others and what their rights are if

mendation (2010) 13 of the Committee of Ministers of the 
Council of Europe to the member states on the protection 
of individuals with regard to automatic profiling of personal 
data in the context of profiling (23 november 2010), Section 
3.6: ‘ When consent is required it is incumbent on the con-
troller to prove that the data subject has agreed to profiling 
on an informed basis, as set out in Section 4’.

they want to access, rectify or delete their data. Basic 
elements of transparency are the requirements that 
the information must be easily accessible and easy to 
understand, and that clear and plain language is used. 
This is particularly relevant in the online environment, 
where quite often privacy notices are unclear, difficult 
to access, non‑transparent and not always in full com‑
pliance with existing rules. Where the data provider is 
based in a country other than that of the user, jurisdic‑
tional differences may have a profound impact on the 
way the data are handled. A case in point is online be‑
havioural advertising, where both the proliferation of 
actors involved in the provision of behavioural adver‑
tising and the technological complexity of the practice 
make it difficult for an individual to know and under‑
stand if personal data are being collected, by whom, 
and for what purpose.180

3.2.6.1  Mandatory Breach Notification

It is also important for individuals to be informed as 
quickly as possible when their data are accidentally 
or unlawfully destroyed, lost, altered, accessed by or 
disclosed to unauthorised persons. The recent revision 
of the e‑Privacy Directive introduced a mandatory per‑
sonal data breach notification covering, however, only 
the telecommunications sector. Given that risks of data 
breaches also exist elsewhere (e.g. the financial sector), 
the obligation to notify personal data breaches should 
be extended to other sectors. A consistent and coher‑
ent approach on this matter will have to be ensured 
even when the organisation breaching the confiden‑
tiality is not based within the EU.181

3.2.6.2  Managing One’s Own Data

Individuals should always be able to access, rectify, de‑
lete or block their data, unless there are legitimate rea‑
sons, provided by law, for preventing this. These rights 
already exist in the current legal framework. However, 
the way in which these rights can be exercised is not 
harmonised. Moreover, this has become particularly 
challenging in the online environment, where data 
are often retained without the person concerned be‑
ing informed and/or having given his or her consent. 
The example of online social networking is particularly

relevant here, as it presents significant challenges to 
the individual’s effective control over his/her personal 
data. The European Commission has received various 
queries from individuals who have not always been 
able to retrieve personal data from online service 
providers, such as their pictures, and who have there‑
fore been impeded in exercising their rights of access, 
rectification, deletion or blocking. Such rights should 
therefore be made more explicit, clarified and, where 
necessary, strengthened.182 The modalities for actual 
exercise of the rights of access, rectification, erasure or 
blocking of data have been improved (e.g. by introduc‑
ing deadlines for responding to individuals’ requests, 
by allowing the exercise of rights by electronic means 
or by providing that right of access should be ensured 
free of charge as a principle).

3.2.7  Right to Data Deletion

Any  person  should  have  a  so‑called  ‘right  to  be 
forgotten’,183 which means that the data subject should 
have the right to ensure that their personal data will 
be deleted and no longer processed, where they have 
withdrawn their consent for processing or where they 
object to the processing of personal data concerning 
them. To tighten this up in the online environment, 
the right to deletion should also be extended in such 
a way that any publicly available copies or replica‑
tions in websites and search engines should also be 
deleted by the controller who made the information 
public.184 The European Commission has also proposed 
complementing the rights of data subjects by ensur‑
ing ‘data portability’, i.e. providing the explicit right for 
an individual to withdraw his/her own data (e.g. his/
her photos or a list of friends) from an application or 
service so that the withdrawn data can be transferred 
to another application or service, as far as technically 
feasible, without hindrance from the data controllers.185

safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of 
personal data. Children tend to underestimate risks 
linked to using the Internet and minimise the conse‑
quences of their behaviour.186 The lack of general rules 
on this in the existing legal framework leads to a frag‑
mented approach and does not recognise the need 
for specific protection of children in specific circum‑
stances, because of their vulnerability, and because 
it causes legal uncertainty, particularly as regards the 
way children’s consent is obtained. Harmonising the 
conditions for allowing children and minors to exercise 
their rights at EU level, especially with regard to the age 
threshold, would certainly bring additional guarantees. 
It should also cover the requirement to use online age 
verification mechanisms.187,188

In the context of providing information to children, spe‑
cial emphasis should be put on giving layered notices 
based on the use of simple, concise and educational 
language that can be easily understood. A shorter no‑
tice should contain the basic information to be provid‑
ed when collecting personal data either directly from 
the data subject or from a third party (Articles 10 and 
11 of the Directive). This should be accompanied by 
a more detailed notice, perhaps via a hyperlink, where 
all the relevant details are provided.189

The interests of vulnerable adults would be better 
protected through additional provisions, specifically 
addressing the collection and further processing of 
their data. These provisions could cover the circum‑
stances in which the consent of a representative or an 
authority is required, together with, or in place of, the 
consent of an incapable individual, and could extend 
to circumstances where it should not be possible to 
use consent as a basis for legitimising the processing 
of personal data.

186  Com (2010) 609 final, 6.

187  There are different mechanisms and different thresholds. 
For example, age verification, rather than being subject to 
one single rule, could be based on a sliding scale approach 
whereby the mechanism to be used would depend on the 
circumstances, such as the type of processing (the purpos-
es), whether particularly risky, type of data collected, data 
usages,(whether the data are intended for disclosure), etc.

Additional criteria should apply when the controller is 
established outside the EU/EEA with a view to ensuring 
that a sufficient connection exists with the EU territory 
and to avoid EU territory being used to conduct illegal

third countries. More harmonisation in regard to the 
obligation of controllers established in third countries 
to appoint a representative in the EU with the objec‑
tive of giving more effectiveness to the role of the rep‑
resentative is recommended. In particular, the extent 
to which data subjects should be able to effectively 
exercise their rights against the representative should 
be clarified.190

4.1  Social Inclusion in the Age of ICT

Rapid developments in, and the ubiquitous diffusion 
of, ICT increasingly means that to utilise many everyday 
services, one has to have access to ICT and the requisite 
skills and motivation to use the technology in order to 
fully participate in today’s society. Digital inclusion is 
fast becoming a prerequisite for social inclusion. Thus, 
it is a matter of concern that despite the great strides 
made in creating the information society, there remains 
a ‘digital divide’ where due to age, gender, geographi‑
cal location or socioeconomic status, there is unequal 
access to and use of ICT. 

A  large  proportion  of  Internet  users  are  young 
people,191 who are often not fully aware of the impli‑
cations that may arise from their use of ICT. The com‑
mercial nature of social networks and the complexity 
of privacy protection, the difficulty of erasing data (in‑
cluding pictures and videos or participation in blogs) 
or the possible uncontrolled diffusion of data originally 
addressed to another cyber‑user and then spread in 
cyber‑space, are all examples of possible risks confront‑
ing Internet users.

Digital Divide Best Practice

A diverse range of initiatives have been undertak‑
en in different countries with a view to closing the 
digital divide that exists between different sectors 
of society, e.g. due to issues relating to age, socio‑
economic status, geographic location and disabil‑
ity. Some of these initiatives have proven successful 
in helping to minimise the digital divide.

South Korea has emerged as one of the foremost 
countries in alleviating problems associated with 
the digital divide, with the Digital Opportunity In‑
dex, which measures the degree of balance within 
the information society, ranking it first among Or‑
ganisation for Economic Co‑operation and Devel‑
opment (OECD) countries for the last three years. 
South  Korea  took  an  assertive,  highly  focused 
and ultimately very successful approach to deal 
with the digital divide issue. This began in the late 
1990s with the establishment of a specific body 
dedicated to this task, namely the Korean Agency 
for Digital Opportunity and Promotion (KADO). 
The KADO’s role was to provide easy and afford‑
able access to ICT services (e.g. IT education, the 
Internet and email) to individuals with disabilities, 
the elderly, low‑income families and to those in ru‑
ral communities. Since its inception the KADO has 
provided these services to over 10 million Koreans. 
In addition to establishing the KADO, the govern‑
ment also introduced specific legislation [i.e. the 
Digital Divide Act (2001)] and has produced two 
comprehensive ‘Master Plans’ to bridge the digi‑
tal divide in 2001 and 2005 respectively. Given the 
success of its initiatives at a national level, South 
Korea has changed focus to provide more support 
to global informatisation and bridging the digital 
divide internationally, particularly within develop‑
ing countries. As part of this change the KADO has 
been merged with the National Information Society 
Agency (NIA). The NIA now runs a number of initia‑
tives, such as the IT and Policy Assistance Program 
and Korea IT Volunteers, with other countries to 
provide expertise, experience, training, technical 
assistance and best practice as part of national IT 
developments in these partner countries.

The One Laptop per Child project, which began in 
2007 aims to provide the opportunity and resourc‑
es to children to help facilitate their ‘self‑empow‑
ered’ education in low‑income countries. To date

the laptops have been supplied to over 2.5 million 
children and teachers in 42 countries, predomi‑
nantly through government‑led programmes. The 
success of this programme relates to the specific 
design and utility of the laptops themselves (i.e. XO 
laptops), particularly given the practical issues as‑
sociated with ICT services in developing countries, 
such as unreliable or nonexistent electricity sup‑
plies and poor Internet connectivity. For example 
the XO laptops are inexpensive, powerful, robust, 
solar‑chargeable, low‑power and can interconnect 
wirelessly to create local networks. In addition, the 
laptops also utilise free and open source software. 

In an effort to improve IT literacy in older people, 
‘The Log On, Learn Programme’, a collaborative 
Irish project involving Intel, Microsoft and An Post 
(Ireland’s national postal service), began in 2008. 
The project involves a secondary level students act‑
ing as mentors (‘buddy’) to an older person from 
their local community and teaching him/her basic 
IT skills (e.g. how to use a computer, word process‑
ing and Internet applications). The students benefit 
through the development of their research, mar‑
keting and teaching skills as well as through the 
interpersonal interactions, which foster intergen‑
erational solidarity. To date more than 165 schools 
have enrolled, providing this one‑to‑one mentoring 
to over 3000 individuals. However, it is envisaged 
that with further roll out the programme has the 
capacity to train up to 30000 individuals. 

In Australia a digital divide has been identified be‑
tween rural and metropolitan areas. One initiate 
that attempts to address the digital divide in rural 
Victoria is the access@schools programme. This 
programme provides people in remote and rural 
areas with free or affordable access to the Internet 
and ICT facilities through local schools outside 
of school hours. The programme was originally 
launched in 2001 and provided ICT access to 12000 
citizens through 145 schools. In light of the success 
of this pilot project further funding was provided 
through the Commonwealth Government to ex‑
pand the programme. 

In an effort to create a digitally‑inclusive society, 
the Society for the Physically Disabled in Singapore, 
established the Infocomm Accessibility (IA) Centre 
as an innovative training facility for individuals with 
physical, sensory and developmental disabilities. 

50

The IA Centre provides industry‑relevant ICT train‑
ing and IT‑related apprenticeships as well as an as‑
sistive technology loan library, with a view to im‑
proving both the independence and employability 
of those with disabilities. 

What these projects serve to illustrate is the impor‑
tance in having both access as well as the knowledge, 
skills and supportive organisational and societal 
structures in order to achieve digital inclusion for all. 

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU),192 
the United Nations’ agency for ICT, publishes compre‑
hensive ICT statistics from 152 countries on an annual 
basis. In its 2011 report it notes that in all countries 
from which data are available and without exception, 
Internet usage is higher amongst individuals with 
a secondary or tertiary educational qualification than 
those with a lower level of education.193 In Europe only 
10 % of people over the age of 64 use the Internet, as 
compared to 73 % of those between 16 and 24 years.194 
While age itself is not a barrier to using digital technol‑
ogies, older people tend to face other obstacles such 
as cost, skills, disability access and attitude, as well as 
lack of awareness and understanding.195,196 

On the basis of these considerations the definition of 
policies which optimise market and socio‑economic 
indicators inputs should not neglect, inter alia, the need 
to guarantee alternative access to services by people 
who, owing to socio‑cultural (or simply for individual 
choice) factors, prefer conventional non‑digital tools to 
make their purchases or access their rights as members

of a community (particularly regarding political partici‑
pation or health‑related services197).

The list of possible digital gaps includes several vul‑
nerable groups: older generations having grown up in 
a pre‑Internet era; less educated people; marginalised 
groups within the European Union; and, from a global 
viewpoint, less (digitally covered) countries or regions 
in the EU and elsewhere in the developed and the de‑
veloping world. All gaps can be described with regard 
to the capacity of using ICT in everyday life, but also 
with regard to having fewer educational or financial 
resources to compete with those who up to now suc‑
cessfully have used ICT to pursue their political, com‑
mercial, scientific or other goals.

cultural expression, social interaction and political par‑
ticipation, but from the perspective of governments 
it is imperative that the rights of those who wish to 
not take part in the ICT revolution must be respected. 
While these citizens’ rights are certainly not to be in‑
terpreted as trumping innovation and progress in ICT, 
a responsible implementation means that their needs 
are as good as possible accommodated. As a conse‑
quence of not choosing to incorporate ICT into their 
daily lives, it is likely that individuals will increasingly 
see their choices limited in the digital age. Therefore, it 
is important that in areas where society places obliga‑
tions on such individuals e.g. submitting tax returns, 
mechanisms unrelated to ICT are in place to help all 
citizens to meet their obligations.

4.2  E‑Government

4.3  Education

The UN E‑Government Survey of 2010 begins with the 
following statement: ‘E‑government is a powerful tool 
for human development and essential to the achieve‑
ment of the internationally agreed development goals 
including the Millennium Development Goals. Many 
countries are experiencing its transformative power in 
revitalizing public administration, overhauling public 
management, fostering inclusive leadership and mov‑
ing civil service towards higher efficiency, transparency 
and accountability. They recognize e‑government as 
a way of realizing the vision of a global information so‑
ciety. In contrast, countries slow to embrace e‑govern‑
ment tend to remain mired in the typical institutional 
pathologies of supply‑driven services and procedures, 
remoteness between government and citizen, and 
opaque decision‑making processes. 

Society experiences rapid, continuous and incessant 
change. The drive to invent, reinvent and discard al‑
most continuously is a unique human pursuit in an ef‑
fort to deliver progress and prosperity for humankind. 
E‑government is aimed at facilitating this change with‑
out ‘leaving anyone behind’ who wishes to participate 
in public social and/or political affairs. ICT are certainly 
welcome on all the different levels of individual and 

197  Some have advocated that e-health, tele-medicine and 
e-care may offer better opportunities of contact between 
medical or care staff members and patients, especially in 
regions where adequate health care cannot be provided, 
e.g. in rural regions. Nevertheless, some have also advocated 
that intensified application of ICT in medicine and health 
care is problematic towards the patient-doctor relation-
ship, the online pharmacy and risks of misuse of drugs, the 
e-driven informed consent procedures, e-prescriptions, etc.

In the domain of education, e‑learning‑tools need to 
be carefully assessed in the way they transform Euro‑
pean traditional face‑to‑face‑communication between 
teachers and students. The style of learning and com‑
municating information seems to be changing through 
the influence of ICT, especially web‑based information 
and educational tools. Searching rather than reading 
becomes the method of choice for building up literacy 
skills. Educational regimes and institutions will have to 
improve access to information on the one hand and, 
on the other hand, build a literate identity for individu‑
als but also for communities and for organisations. It 
seems clear that we are facing profound transforma‑
tions in our patterns of processing information and 
shaping our educational infrastructure.

4.3.1  Culture

ICT is a domain where every culture may express it‑
self, in its peculiarity. In a globalised world, every cul‑
ture may communicate through ICT with any other, in 
a very rapid way; everyone has the chance to take part, 
actively, in multicultural life. The free flow of informa‑
tion gives an opportunity for increasing intercultural 
dialogue, and boosts individuals’ chances of sharing 
trans‑cultural knowledge and broadening their own 
outlook beyond cultural boundaries. ICT may enable 
the protection of minority languages and cultures 
where efforts are made for those within the cultures 
to interact with one another. On the other hand ICT 
may tend to make cultures more uniform, assimilating 
the differences (e.g. using one language, English) and 
aligning the standard of communication in all countries 
of the world, with the risk of affecting cultural diversity.

4.4  E‑Health

The growth of new health information technology op‑
portunities brings a responsibility to design interoper‑
able, easy to use, engaging, and accessible e‑Health 
applications that communicate the right information 
needed to guide health care and health promotion for 
diverse audiences. Moreover, the wider deployment 
of e‑Health raises certain ethical and regulatory con‑
cerns. One of the fundamental challenges lies in ensur‑
ing that patient data remain confidential and secure in 
order to build trust and confidence in e‑Health systems. 
Appropriate measures should be put in place that can 
be reasonably expected to safeguard the security and 
integrity of personal medical information. 

Heretofore the clinical encounter between doctor and 
patient has been physical and concerns have been ex‑
pressed that the move to a virtual environment could 
undermine the doctor‑patient relationship, especially 
amongst older populations. Other commentators have 
pointed to the positive collaborative aspects of this sort 
of interaction, with patients developing a greater sense 
of responsibility, accountability and knowledge allow‑
ing them to participate in medical decision‑making.198 
There are however variations in patient preferences and 
many patients are happy to defer to their doctors’ deci‑
sions.199 The relationship between doctor and patient is 
embedded in values of commitment, trust, privacy, con‑
fidentiality and responsibility, and it is vital that e‑Health 
should facilitate the realisation of these principles.

There is an enormous amount of medical information 
to be found on the Internet. This information, however, 
tends not to be screened, edited or assessed for ac‑
curacy and can be inexact or even misleading. It can 
be difficult for patients to judge the quality of the in‑
formation presented on the many websites that offer 
health information and advice, and patients can also 
experience difficulties in putting the information into 
the context of their specific clinical situation. Both the 
Italian National Bioethics Committee200 and the Nuf‑
field Council201 have recommended that all websites

containing health information should develop quality 
criteria including the basis of the information, the au‑
thors, funding arrangements, and how any personal 
data will be used, and that ideally such websites should 
seek accreditation from recognised schemes.

The distribution of the benefits and risks of e‑Health 
must be carefully considered. It is well established that 
those with lower educational and income levels have 
worse health. If more healthcare services are shifted to 
new media, we could leave behind those with limited 
health literacy or access to technology. Ensuring that 
new technologies empower people, rather than exac‑
erbate health inequalities, needs to be at the forefront 
of the exciting developments in this area.

4.5  E‑environment

The influence of the use of ICT on the environment is com‑
plex and may have positive and negative consequences. 
ICT may provide tools for the protection of environment: 
monitoring environmental issues, managing urban envi‑
ronment systems, communicating environmental knowl‑
edge, disseminating information to the public, stimulat‑
ing active participation of citizens, enabling efficient use 
of resources, reducing the consumption of energy and 
essential natural resources (reducing the consumption of 
paper through electronic and paperless communication), 
bettering the use of natural resources. Examples include 
using technologies to improve practices in agriculture 
including minimisation of chemical usage, monitoring 
air and water pollution, prediction of environmental 
changes permitting action to be taken to protect where 
appropriate and improving the efficiency of the energy, 
transportation, and goods and services sectors. At the 
same time, the sustainability of these technologies must 
be managed to avoid unintended consequences such as 
increased consumption of scarce resources and a very 
large increase in energy usage and environmental dam‑
age from electronic waste (e‑pollution). 

Although ICT require energy resources, they may offer 
many ecological opportunities. ICT may have positive 
and negative consequences on the environment and on 
environmental sustainability. The positive impact of ICT 
is generally considered very high, so that it may balance 
some negative aspects. ICT may improve environmental

performances and may offer tools for the protection of 
the environment in many different ways: 

•	 Direct effects, which arise from the design, produc‑
tion, distribution, maintenance and disposal of ICT 
goods and services by the ICT industry202. 

•	

•	

Indirect effects, which arise from the application and 
use of ICTs in society, in government and public insti‑
tutions, in research and scientific communities. ICTs 
may offer promising solutions for enhancing our 
capacity to give warning of, predict and track envi‑
ronmental changes and disasters, developing appro‑
priate management that are able to minimize risks 
and maximize adaptation strategies. Of course we 
can not predict, but enhance the ability to anticipate 
change designing the future ecological scenario, in 
order to be in a better position to adapt to it203. 

Systemic effects, which arise from changes in social 
and organizational structures enabling the availa‑
bility, accessibility, application and use of ICT goods 
and services. In this aspect ICTs may contribute to 
reducing pollution and the consumption of ener‑
gy204. In this sense, the choices of organizations and 
communities about how to use ICTs to change their 

202  The so called ‘green ICTs’ are technologies which are ethi-
cally designed in order to constantly facilitate the control 
of energy consumption: i.e. smart ICT applications, sensor 
networks and applications in smart power grids, smart build-
ings/housing, intelligent transportation systems and smart 
industrial processes make significant contributions to more 
efficient resource use and reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
and other pollutants. In particular, ‘intelligent transport sys-
tems’ may render transport more efficient, fast and cheap; 
‘telework’ may be a solution for traffic and fuel pollution. 
Green digital intelligence may monitor, control, adjust, man-
age new green industry sectors that are ecologically friendly.

203  Examples of such technological transformation are: planning 
strategies in order to monitor environmental issues on a glob-
al scale (to address environmental degradation and climate 
change; to combat and slow down global warming, reducing 
CO2 emissions and accelerating green growth; to predict disas-
ter or damages) or on a local scale (to manage urban environ-
ment systems, monitoring energy distribution, air and water 
pollution; to improve practices in agriculture and forestry).

i.e. ‘Paper Consumption Reduction’, reducing the consump-
tion of paper through electronic and paperless communica-
tion; ‘Dematerialization’, controlling and limiting the printing 
of documents by exchanging information electronically; 
‘Wireless Network Energy Savings’, controlling the consump-
tion of the energy of mobiles, constantly monitoring the 
level of temperature in order to guarantee the functioning 
of mobiles without energy waste.

structures will play a potentially significant role in 
determining whether there is a successful global 
response to the challenge of environmental issues. 

At the same time, ICTs may have a negative impact on 
the environment: consumption of energy, not fully recy‑
clable apparatus’ and technology (toxic e‑waste pollu‑
tion). Electronic waste has become a major issue of digi‑
tal ethics. It deals with the ICT devices (hardware waste 
and recycling of old computers) that already today have 
devastating consequences on the environment.

Intelligent Transportation Systems

Information and Communication Technologies 
(ICT) are in the early stages of transforming trans‑
portation systems. Intelligent Transportation Sys‑
tems (ITS) are generally regarded as the integrated 
application of computer, sensor, electronics and 
communication technologies to deliver a safer, 
more efficient and more sustainable transport sys‑
tem. ITS can empower commuters, road network 
providers, and actual devices, such as traffic lights 
with actionable information, thereby facilitating 
better informed decisions which can help save 
lives, time and money. Future developments in this 
area are likely to focus on thing‑to‑thing, vehicle‑
to‑person, vehicle‑to‑vehicle and vehicle‑to‑infra‑
structure communications, the so‑called ‘internet 
of things’. The basic concept involves the perva‑
sive use of Radio Frequency Identification Devices 
(RFID) tags, sensors, actuators, and mobile vehicles, 
which through unique addressing systems, are able 
to communicate with each other and cooperate in 
reaching common goals. Networking of previously 
offline objects, like cars and roads may represent 
the next big stage in the evolution of ICT. 

The growth of ICT has already resulted in novel ap‑
plications in the surface transport sector including 
improved road safety, traffic management systems, 
the provision of information to and from vehicles 
(e.g.  navigational  aids)  and  seamless  financial 
transactions (e.g. tolls). Key enabling technologies 
include global positioning systems (GPS) which 
receive signals from several satellites to calculate 
position, wireless networks, radiowave and infrared 
beacons, as well as dedicated short range commu‑
nications (DSRC) specifically designed for automo‑
tive use allowing two‑way wireless communication 
between vehicles and roads.

RECOMMENDATIONS | 10EGE OPINION | PART B:

Good traffic management can also reduce conges‑
tion on our roads, It is estimated that 10% of the EU 
road network is affected by congestion, at a yearly 
cost of 0.9‑1.5% EU GDP. A number of ITS applications 
such as traffic light optimisation, ramp metering and 
congestion charging can contribute to enhancing 
the operational performance of road networks. If 
traffic lights are coordinated in an intelligent way, 
based on dynamic information collected from the 
road infrastructure and the vehicles which use it, a 
road network can be used with optimal capacity‑ 
during quiet times as well as in peak times with com‑
peting traffic demands. A number of European citi‑
zens have introduced congestion pricing schemes; 
charging for entry into urban centres at peak times. 
In 2007, Stockholm introduced congestion charg‑
ing using RFID tags installed in cars which commu‑
nicated with receivers at the entry points into the 
city and triggered automatic payments. Within three 
years, there was a 50% reduction in traffic wait time, 
CO2 emissions in the inner city were cut by 14‑18% 
and 60.000 additional passengers were using public 
transport on a daily basis. ITS helps reduce the envi‑
ronmental impact of road travel by optimising trips, 
educing accidents and congestion as well as enhanc‑
ing vehicle and driver performance. Optimal route 
planning will reduce the number of kilometres driv‑
en, and better control systems for the car will make 
the ride more energy efficient. Vehicles equipped 
with eco‑driving features can provide feedback to 
motorists on how to drive at the most fuel‑efficient 
speed across a number of different road conditions. 
Moreover, by providing people with real‑time in‑
formation on departure and arrival times, thereby 
reducing travel uncertainty, public transport can be 
made more attractive to travellers. The widespread 
deployment of such ITS applications should aid in 
meeting the EU goal to reduce greenhouse gas emis‑
sions to 20% below 2008 levels. 

The importance of ITS in delivering improvements 
in transport efficiency, safety and sustainability has 
been recognised by the European Commission in 
its 2008 ‘Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelli‑
gent Transport System in Europe’. The Action Plan 
was followed by the adoption of Directive 2010/40/
EU aimed at providing a framework for the coordi‑
nated implementation of ITS across the EU. There 
are however a number of challenges involved in de‑
veloping and deploying ITS. In order to realise the 
full potential of ITS to the transportation network, 

Despite the fact that the number of road fatalities in 
the European Union (EU) has almost halved in the last 
decade, there were still 34.500 people killed in Euro‑
pean roads in 2009. Quite apart from the devastating 
human toll, the cost of such tragedies in 2009 was es‑
timated to be €130 billion. Intelligent Transportation 
Systems provide the tolls to make transformational 
improvements in safety and can assist in realising the 
EU goal of halving overall road fatalities by 2020. Most 
developments in transportation safety in the last 50 
years were designed to minimise injury to passen‑
gers in the event of a collision e.g. seatbelts, airbags. 
ITS has shifted the focus from collision protection to 
prevention. Advanced emergency braking systems 
(AEBS), lane departure warning systems (LDW) and 
intelligent speed adaptation are already available in 
a limited number of cars. In the case of AEBS, which 
triggers full on braking when it calculates there is an 
acute risk of a rear end collision and the driver has 
failed to react, the European Commission has set 
1 November 2013 as the date for when AEBS becomes 
mandatory for new type trucks over 3.5 tonnes and 
passenger vehicles with more than nine seats. 

More recent developments have focused on the 
design of intelligent vehicles which have location, 
acceleration, orientation and proximity sensors all 
transmitting and gathering data to and from nearby 
cars and road infrastructure. Networked vehicles 
could communicate real time data about driving 
conditions ahead and have the potential to reduce 
collisions through advisories and warnings. Vehicle 
operators could be alerted to an accident ahead, 
poor road conditions such as black ice and advice 
on remedial actions to be taken could be provided. 
Vehicles could automatically take evasive actions in 
the case of the driver not responding to a warning 
and vehicles could even refuse dangerous instruc‑
tions from the driving e.g. speeding on wet roads. 
The intelligent car initiative, one of the flagship pro‑
jects of the EU i2010 programme similarly aims to har‑
ness there new developments in ICT to improve road 
safety. While the advent of wholly autonomous cars 
is some years away, in 2011 Google began test driv‑
ing its self driving car on public roads. To date, the 
seven autonomous test cars have driven over 190.000 
miles on busy city streets, motorways and mountain‑
ous roads with only occasional human intervention. 
Unlike human motorists, autonomous cars will not 
suffer from distraction, fatigue or intoxication and 
as such offer the possibility of safer transportation.

it must operate at scale, both nationally and across 
borders. The current lack of technical standards in 
this area make it difficult to ensure interoperability 
however, the European Commission has undertaken 
to develop specifications to overcome this obstacle 
as a priority action in Directive 2010/40/EU/ Further‑
more, data collected by ITS applications can effec‑
tively track movements by vehicles and individuals 
through the transport system. While this informa‑
tion is helpful from a transport planning perspective, 
there are legitimate concerns regarding the protec‑
tion of such personal information. Article 13 of the 
Directive 2010/40/EU provides an undertaking to 
refer this issue, as appropriate to the European Data 
Protection Supervisor and request an opinion of the 
Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with 
regard to the Processing of Personal Data.

4.6  Political Dimension

Blogs, social networks and online video platforms are 
now widely available for everyone with access to the 
Internet. The opportunities provided by technology are 
rightly considered of key importance for facilitating po‑
litical participation, thereby strengthening democracy.

The participatory dimension of ICT and especially of 
web 2.0 based programming allows more participa‑
tory democracy in political decisions.205 In terms of an 
individual’s blogging or grassroots communications, 
more and more people, ranging from single individu‑
als to discordant communities, are able to spread their 
opinion and to look for companions sharing their views. 
The non‑hierarchical approach of web 2.0 based com‑
munications also fosters the opportunity for more and 
more people to find information beyond political or 
mainstream channels. ICT can therefore amplify po‑
litical participation of individuals and encourage the 
diffusion of ‘non conventional’ ideas that contribute to 

205  The Internet can also provide tools to help overcome access 
barriers. Take the example of Egypt. After the Internet was 
shut down and Egyptians could not be heard outside their 
borders, a small team of Googlers working with people from 
Twitter and SayNow, a voice and text company acquired by 
Google just a week earlier, worked over a weekend to give 
people a new tool enabling them to leave voice messages 
that are posted on Twitter. The tool is called ‘Speak2Tweet’ 
and it fits with our mission of lowering barriers to access to 
information and making communication tools easy to use 
and more widely available.

political pluralism and democratic debate across the 
world.206 

The Internet provides a new input into the political do‑
main and it is possible that the Internet enables a new 
kind of ‘digital citizenship’ with specific rights207: the 
right to connection; the right to net neutrality (which 
excludes the content control powers and duties of 
network operators); the right to freedom of expression 
with the subsequent exclusion of forms of censorship; 
the right of access to web content. This new dimen‑
sion should not be seen as a category that replaces the 
traditional forms of citizenship but as an expansion of 
the concept of citizenship, understood as a set of rights 
and powers belonging to every person, wherever they 
may be in the world.

Another impact these technologies have on shaping the 
political culture is the claim of transparency. Civil socie‑
ties groups, the community of hackers, and up‑and‑com‑
ing political parties focusing on web activities are strong‑
ly in favour of ensuring that political decision‑making 
processes become more transparent than they have 
traditionally been. Established political parties, national 
and international authorities (not least at the EU level) are 
challenged to cope with the emerging claim for transpar‑
ency if they are willing to meet expectations to build 
and sustain trust in the results and procedures of their 
work. It is also claimed that the blog‑culture and social 
networks bring about more participation and therefore 
more diversity in a media‑driven world. 

The use of ICT may also impact on the collective history 
of groups. Many welcome the fact that ICT present multi‑
ple opportunities to literally ‘(re‑)write’ history in a more 
‘democratic’ way, as could recently be observed in the 
role of social media in the Arab Spring revolutions. ICT 
may indeed enable citizens to take a broad participatory 
and plural approach to the documentation of historical 
events. ICT in this way certainly can play an important 
role in political participation, empowering people to 
present their ‘own’ views and testimonies instead of 
having to rely only upon sources often considered as 

206  Clearly risks of diffusion of detrimental ideological positions 
exist, such as ideologies conducing to racism, violence, eth-
nic discrimination, etc. Here, a similar ethical analysis on how 
to balance freedom of speech with the right to be protected 
against discrimination of other violations of rights is nec-
essary as was the case in the above-stated conflict in the 
general social sphere.

the ‘official’ history. The bottom‑up documentation 
of political actions must not, however, be conceived 
naively, especially not when new media are involved. 
The ‘deliberate selective views’ of the representation 
of facts involve not only professional journalism (as is 
the case, for example, when war journalists may not re‑
port independently but are ‘embedded’ in an army) but 
also grass‑root movements whose reports can easily be 
one‑sided; re‑designed photographs, for example, have 
for a long time been a topic broadly discussed in media 
theory and media ethics,208 and need to be continuously 
closely examined in connection with ICT.

4.7  E‑Commerce

According to the Communication adopted by the Com‑
mission in January 2012 (COM(2011) 941 and 942), the 
EU Single Market for e‑commerce is still not functioning 
as it should because there are significant differences in 
the rules, standards and practices applied to e‑com‑
merce within individual Member States. As a result, 
companies find it difficult to provide online services 
or to sell goods across EU borders, and citizens miss 
out on the opportunity to purchase goods and services 
from websites based in other EU countries. 

Some suggest that the first beneficiary of a better‑func‑
tioning Internal Market for e‑commerce would be Eu‑
ropean consumers who would benefit from a wider 
range of goods and services and lower prices, thanks 
in particular to online price and quality comparisons. 
A better‑functioning Internal Market for e‑commerce 
could also create jobs, and help people to look for jobs 
or work from home. It could bring environmental ben‑
efits because it could reduce the need for physical pro‑
duction methods (e.g. through more purchases of digi‑
tal music or online newspapers) and cut the frequency 
of certain journeys (e.g. more working from home or 
provision of advice online). A study into e‑commerce 
in goods209 showed that consumers can save about 
€ 11.7 billion a year (an amount equivalent to 0.12 %

York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, 2003). Analysing 20th cen-
tury examples of photo documentaries, Sontag shows 
how documentary photographs are often manipulated in 
order to create public emotions of shame or compassion. 
Public perception is also directed when certain images are 
repeated over and over again, while other events are barely 
covered. Here, the Internet certainly has a critical role.

of EU GDP) thanks to lower prices and wider choice. If 
e‑commerce were to grow to 15 % of the total retail 
sector and Single Market barriers were eliminated, total 
consumer welfare gains would reach around € 204 bil‑
lion, equivalent to 1.7 % of EU GDP. 

But a better e‑commerce system in the EU would also 
respond to specific ethical concerns that may be identi‑
fied by Internet users. For example, ‘Notice‑and‑action’ 
procedures refer to rules on removal or blocking of ac‑
cess to illegal content by an online company, after it has 
received a request to do so. Internet users can submit 
a notification of illegal content that they have found 
displayed on the website of an online intermediary 
(such as a social network, an online vendor or a search 
engine). To avoid liability, the e‑commerce Directive 
obliges the online intermediary to take action as soon 
as it becomes aware of the illegal content. Such action 
can take the form of takedown (removing content) or 
blocking (disabling access to content). In responses to 
the public consultation on e‑commerce, stakeholders 
complained that it is not clear how these procedures are 
meant to work. As a result, illegal content stays online 
for too long, companies face legal uncertainty and the 
rights of content providers (like individuals who upload 
content on the Internet) are not always respected.210 

The European Commission has also published a pro‑
posal for a directive on consumer rights (EC/2011/83). 
It addresses technology changes (like e‑commerce or 
online auctions) but it does not cover the specific case 
of cloud computing where security failures may lead 
to harmful consequences for individuals, ranging from 
undesired spam to identity theft. The recent revision 
of the e‑Privacy Directive introduced a mandatory 

210  As regards the e-commerce Directive’s provisions on the 
liability of service providers, it should be noted that the 
Directive states that online service providers that are simply 
‘transmitting’ content on the Internet (for instance compa-
nies that provide consumers with access to the Internet) 
cannot be held liable for illegal content that is uploaded by 
third parties. For example, an Internet access provider can-
not be held liable for providing access to an illegal website. 
Online service providers that ‘host’’ content on the Internet 
(for instance websites on which you can view content that 
users themselves put online) cannot be held liable for illegal 
content uploaded onto their websites by others, as long as 
they are not aware of it. However, as soon as they become 
aware of this illegal content (for example via a notification), 
they are obliged to remove it or to block access to it im-
mediately. Governments may not impose a general obli-
gation on online service providers to monitor the content 
that they transmit or host. http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/

4.7.1  Data Mining

Financial and insurance companies have mined their 
data for several years, in order to detect patterns of 
fraudulent credit card use or in identifying behaviour 
patterns of customers that pose risks to the industry211. 
Thus, data mining is not new, but is a technique that 
is being developed and deployed on an increasingly 
large scale. The mining of data in individual data‑
bases in order to identify new information is simple; 
cross‑correlation of the information in multiple data‑
bases poses serious issues. 

Commercial organisations have become active in us‑
ing data mining in order to design effective sales cam‑
paigns, target marketing plans in an effort to match 
products with customers, and design new products to 
increase sales and profitability.212 Data mining is also be‑
ing used by law enforcement agencies to investigate 
criminal activities and in an effort to avert terrorist ac‑
tions. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
in the United States of America published a report in 
2010213 outlining the various data mining approaches 
being adopted and developed for the purpose of re‑
trieval and analysis of intelligence information. Data 
mining promises considerable potential benefits, not 
least in the area of clinical research where it is being 
used to identify potential chemical compounds for clini‑
cal trials and in analysing the huge amount of research 
results obtained by molecular medicine, such as genetic 
or genomic signatures.214 Outside of R&D there are many 
potential applications from modelling of healthcare to 
pharmacovigilance, to understanding prescribing be‑
haviour and aiding clinical decision‑making.215 

Data mining practices that involve the use of personal 
data raise a number of privacy concerns. When data

relating to activities and characteristics of individuals 
are mined, they can reveal large amounts of previously 
unknown personal information that the subject of the 
data never intended to be disclosed, even though the 
separate pieces of data may have each been gathered 
with their consent. This concern is exacerbated by the 
fact that data subjects are often unaware that their data 
are being used in this way, thereby limiting their abil‑
ity to seek access to the data generated.216 As it is not 
possible to predict what kind of patterns or information 
will be revealed, it is not possible to clearly specify the 
exact purpose for which the data are being used. Thus, 
it is unclear whether data mining is compatible with the 
‘use limitation’ and ‘purpose specification’ principles of 
Directive 95/46/EC.

The fundamental problem of privacy violation is fur‑
ther amplified if data sets used in data mining are in‑
complete or incorrect, thereby rendering the process 
inaccurate.217 Data are gathered from many different 
sources, not all of commensurate quality. As previously 
mentioned, if data subjects are unaware that such data 
exist, they are denied the opportunity of correcting any 
inaccuracies.

4.7.2 

Internet of Things (IoT)

The Internet of things is a promising ICT sector (think of 
the smart meter, smart grid and electric cars). Potential 
uses of IoT include the home environment, smart city 
and health monitor devices. The use of IoT changes radi‑
cally the relationship between humans and the inter‑
connected autonomous objects, giving to the last ones 
autonomy towards the interaction with human beings. 
This new use of technological mediums therefore opens 
a number of ethics questions related to autonomy (of 
things and humans); Security (dual use; freedom, lib‑
erty); equity/ equality / justice / fairness (access; treat‑
ment; discrimination / discriminatory interfaces). Simi‑
larly the encoding of data concerning the human users 
of IoT and their transmission to IoT control centralised 
systems open issues related to data profiling, confiden‑
tiality and autonomy, such as other uses of RFID.

RECOMMENDATIONS | 10EGE OPINION | PART B:

4.7.3  E‑advertising

Advertising is a form of communication used to encour‑
age or persuade an audience (viewers, readers or listen‑
ers) to continue or take some new action. Most com‑
monly, the desired result is to drive consumer behavior 
with respect to a commercial offering, although political 
and ideological advertising is also common. Advertising 
messages are usually paid for by sponsors and viewed 
via various traditional media; including mass media 
such as newspaper, magazines, television commercial, 
radio advertisement, outdoor advertising or direct mail; 
or new media such as websites and text messages. 
Clearly the volume of Internet users has induced ICT to 
massive use this commercial tool for financing the ser‑
vices provide to their users. Although this mechanism 
does not open new ethical considerations on fair trade 
and business, some use of advertising may be ethically 
problematic in particular when concerned with porn, 
paedophilia, bestiality and divulgation of political views 
which contravene human rights and human dignity.

4.8  Conclusions

ICT may well challenge centuries‑old concepts like time 
and the relation of oneself towards the past, the pre‑
sent, and the future: How do we situate ourselves in the 
present that transcends the physical space of percep‑
tion and ‘real‑life’ experience; the notion of space and 
the local background shaping one’s identity changes, 
too; the perception of oneself and others, and even the 
formation of group identities undergo radical changes 
compared to traditional identity concepts. This ‘digital 
turn’ of society raises multiple philosophical, social, po‑
litical, legal, ethical, and also psychological questions.218 
To address them thoroughly is impossible in this Opin‑
ion. Therefore, the EGE emphasises that the political and 
legal regulations must be complemented by broader 
considerations, and points to several areas that raise 
ethical concerns and should be further examined, even 
though these may not translate into immediate politi‑
cal governance or legal regulation. The EGE therefore 
deems it necessary to make a number of recommenda‑
tions (set out in the next chapter) for responsible imple‑
mentation of the European Digital Agenda.

York: Simon & Schuster, 1995); Jayle Gackenbach, ed. Psy-
chology and the Internet: Intrapersonal, Interpersonal, and 
Transpersonal Implications (San Diego: 1998); Mark Smith,

Ethics of information and communication technologies10 | RECOMMENDATIONSPART C: | RECOMMENDATIONS

PART C: 5 RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1  The Ethical Framework 

of the Opinion 

In March 2011, President Jose Manuel Barroso request‑
ed the EGE to draft an Opinion on the ethical issues 
arising from the rapid expansion of Information and 
Communication Technologies, stating that the Opin‑
ion could ‘offer a reference point to the Commission 
to promote responsible use of the Digital Agenda for 
Europe and facilitating the societal acceptance of such 
an important policy item’.

The EGE recognises the role Information and Communi‑
cation Technologies play in European and global socie‑
ty and welcomes the European Commission’s efforts to 
implement the Digital Agenda for Europe in a responsi‑
ble and innovative way. The group also underlines the 
efforts the European Union is making in designing its 
policy frames in accordance with the fundamental val‑
ues of the European Union and underlines the need to 
build this process in a democratic and transparent way. 
ICT enables globalisation in ways not predicted when 
globalisation was first discussed, and the impact of this 
new, global world must be considered through the lens 
of the fundamental values of the European Union

The EGE has chosen to focus mainly on Internet tech‑
nologies, realising that it is impossible to address the 
vast range of issues that are encompassed within the 
scope of Information and Communication Technolo‑
gies (ICT) as a whole. As a consequence, the security 
issues arising from ICT will be examined by the EGE in 
a subsequent Opinion to be provided to the Commis‑
sion, as requested by President Barroso, in 2013. The 
EGE has also decided not to address issues related to 
IPR and it is aware of the controversy related to the 
on‑going and future negotiations of the Anti‑Counter‑
feiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).

The following EGE recommendations will therefore 
be of a general nature and will include access to ICT, 
identity, e‑commerce, privacy, data protection and 
a number of social questions linked to the use of ICT in 
the EU and globally.

This Opinion is set within the context of the funda‑
mental rights and values stated in the Treaty on Eu‑
ropean Union as they form an ethical basis for the 
recommendations.

Article 2: The Union is founded on the values of 
respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, 
equality, the rule of law and respect for human 
rights, including the rights of persons belonging 
to minorities. These values are common to the 
Member States in a society in which pluralism, 
non‑discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and 
equality between women and men prevail.

Article 3: 1. The Union’s aim is to promote peace, its 
values and the well‑being of its peoples. (…)
3. The Union shall establish an internal market. It 
shall work for the sustainable development of Eu‑
rope based on balanced economic growth and 
price stability, a highly competitive social market 
economy, aiming at full employment and social 
progress, and a high level of protection and im‑
provement of the quality of the environment. It 
shall promote scientific and technological advance. 
It shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, 
and shall promote social justice and protection, 
equality between women and men, solidarity be‑
tween generations and protection of the rights of 
the child. It shall promote economic, social and 
territorial cohesion, and solidarity among Member 
States. It shall respect its rich cultural and linguis‑
tic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe’s cultural 
heritage is safeguarded and enhanced. (…)
5. In its relations with the wider world, the Union 
shall uphold and promote its values and interests 
and contribute to the protection of its citizens. (…)

Promoting this framework of values, together with the 
commitment to peace and the well‑being of the Un‑
ion’s peoples, is the main objective of the Union in all 
policies including the Digital Agenda and ICT Govern‑
ance. For this Opinion, the group emphasises especially 
the importance of the following principles:

•	 Human  dignity:  The  Charter  of  Fundamental 
Rights of the European Union states that ‘Human 
dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and pro‑
tected’ (Article 1);219 

219 

‘The dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental 
right in itself but constitutes the real basis of fundamental rights’ 
(Declaration concerning the explanations relating to the 
Charter of Fundamental Rights).

RECOMMENDATIONS | 10RECOMMENDATIONS | PART C:

•	 Respect of freedom which secures, inter alia, the 
right to uncensored communication and agency in 
the digital era;

underlines that this approach should also be pro‑
moted internationally with specific attention for 
less developed regions of the world.

•	 Respect for democracy, citizenship and partici‑
pation which includes, inter alia, protection against 
unjustified exclusion and protection against unlaw‑
ful discrimination;

•	 Respect  of  privacy  which  secures,  inter  alia, 
the personal private sphere against unjustified 
interventions;

•	 Respect of autonomy and informed consent 
which secures, inter alia, the right to information 
and consent to the use of data or actions that are 
based on the data‑processing;

•	

Justice which secures, inter alia, the equal access 
to ICT, and a fair sharing of its benefits;

•	 Solidarity among European citizens aims, inter 
alia, at the inclusion of everyone who wishes to 
participate in ICT, but also aims to secure the social 
inclusion of those who, for example, either cannot 
participate in online practices or wish to maintain 
alternative social interactions. 

The EGE acknowledges the number of positive ac‑
tions already undertaken by the European Union and 
its Institutions and makes a number of recommenda‑
tions to guarantee that the European Digital Agenda 
can contribute to the flourishing and prosperity of the 
Union while respecting the values on which Europe is 
founded and that it continues to embrace. 

•

•	

The EGE calls for educational programmes to en‑
able individuals to develop technical and /or digi‑
tal literacy: tools to simplify the applications of ICT, 
and increase digital literacy in the EU population, 
addressing especially the requirements of persons 
with special needs: tools that educate people on 
how to use the Internet (e.g. from online banking 
to e‑reading).

The EGE calls for educational programmes to fos‑
ter and raise awareness and responsibility con‑
cerning ICT’s impact on one’s personal, social and 
moral identity.

The EGE welcomes actions on open access taken 
by the EU and encourages further actions in this 
area to be explored.

5.3  Recommendations Concerning Individu‑

al Identity

Concepts of personal identity – i.e. the identification 
concerning the authenticity of a user who engages in 
the multiple activities that ICT makes possible, and the 
individual identity that refers to the identity of a person, 
including his or her values, goals, or self‑interpretation – 
take on new forms and change considerably in the ‘digi‑
tal era’. In the previous part, the EGE has addressed sev‑
eral ethical challenges that need further analysis and 
examination with respect to the question of identity, 
and the group recommends a number of actions: 

5.2  Right of Access to ICT

•	

The European Charter of Fundamental Rights requires 
that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to 
shaping European Society, which of course includes use 
of ICT. The protection of the principle of equality there‑
fore is relevant in several domains of an individual’s life, 
such as education, work, commerce and health. The EGE 
welcomes actions by the EC in the ICT sector and invites 
the EU to actively participate and promote access to ICT 
in European societies, while safeguarding access to ba‑
sic societal services by citizens unwilling to use ICT tools 
or unable to use them, by virtue of being incapacitated 
for technical, educational or socio‑economical reasons. 

•	

The EGE recommends that the EU secure and pro‑
mote the right of access to the Internet. The EGE 

60

The Group is of the view that in order to support the 
responsible use of ICT technologies envisaged by 
the European Digital Agenda, the EU should sup‑
port the development of educational tools aimed 
at creating and developing ‘social literacy’ amongst 
users including supporting the personal responsi‑
bility that should be exercised. Programmes should 
aim to foster respect, tolerance and sensitivity 
when communicating digitally. 

•	 Due to the increasingly complex and multiple op‑
tions offered by the Internet, the EGE is of the view 
that additional safeguards should be in place for 
children and adolescents, in order to ensure a safe 
environment in which to learn and play. Thus, the 
Group recommends that awareness raising ac‑
tivities for children, adolescents, their parents and 

Ethics of information and communication technologies10 | RECOMMENDATIONSPART C: | RECOMMENDATIONS

teachers be incorporated in EU educational pro‑
grammes and policy actions.

•	

•	

The EGE recommends that the EU provides means 
to foster responsibility amongst those using ICT, 
whether individual users or those providing ser‑
vices. This should address accountability, identifi‑
cation, and traceability for Internet identities. 

The EGE acknowledges the studies that demon‑
strate the psychological impact of ICT usage on 
personal development. The Group recommends 
that the EU take steps to raise the awareness of 
these changes by promoting and financing further 
research, particularly monitoring the impact of ICT 
on the development and concepts of identity in 
Horizon 2020. 

5.4  The Right to Privacy 

and Protection of Data

For those who wish to embrace innovations in the ICT 
arena, it is important that they be facilitated in that en‑
deavour, while retaining their right to autonomy and 
personal privacy. While the concept of privacy is some‑
what difficult to explain, many people retain a ‘sense 
of privacy’, i.e. an understanding that certain aspects 
of their life are no one’s business but their own. This 
view is perpetuated through the frequent descriptions 
of the concept of privacy as an individual’s right to be 
left alone or a barrier against intrusion from the out‑
side world. Privacy facilitates our understanding of our 
sense of self, i.e. the recognition that our thoughts and 
our actions are our own, which is essential for the attri‑
bution of moral responsibility. This enables an individu‑
al to exercise some level of control over the information 
he/she makes available to particular parties, thereby 
preserving his/her autonomy and personal privacy.

Individuals need sufficient control of their online data to 
enable them to use the Internet responsibly. Clarifica‑
tion concerning the conditions for the data subject’s 
consent220 should therefore be provided, in order to 
always guarantee informed consent and ensure that 
the individual is fully aware that he or she is consent‑
ing to data processing and what it entails, in line with 

220  This is however complicated by the fact that, in some cases, 
it is not even clear what would constitute freely given, spe-
cific and informed consent to data processing, such as in the 
case of behavioural advertising, where Internet browser set-
tings are considered by some, but not by others, to deliver 
the user’s consent.

Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Clar‑
ity on key concepts can also favour the development of 
self‑regulatory initiatives to develop practical solutions 
consistent with EU law (Com (2010) 609 final, 9). Privacy 
by design (privacy and data protection are embedded 
throughout the entire life cycle of technologies, from 
the early design stage to their deployment, use and ul‑
timate disposal) should be incorporated into informed 
consent procedures.

The EGE welcomes and supports the proposed revi‑
sion of the EU data protection regulatory framework 
adopted by the Commission in January 2012, the Group 
underlined that during the inter‑institutional debate on 
the proposed regulatory frame the following recom‑
mendations are taken into account:

•	

•	

The Group recommends that the characteristics 
that qualify data as personal data be clarified, 
and its relevance to different ICT uses (such as IP ad‑
dresses, unique RFID‑numbers, geo‑location data), 
as well as the development of new data types. This 
clarification should then be incorporated into the 
EU data protection regulatory frame. 

In the light of technological and other societal 
developments, there is a need to reconsider the 
existing provisions on sensitive data, to examine 
whether other categories of data should be added 
and to further clarify the conditions for their pro‑
cessing. This concerns, for example, genetic data 
and biometric data.

•	 Transparency  is  a  fundamental  condition  for 
enabling individuals to exercise control over their 
own data and to ensure effective protection of per‑
sonal data. It is therefore essential that individuals 
should be well and clearly informed, in a simple 
and transparent way, by data controllers about 
how and by whom their data are collected and 
processed, for what reasons, for how long and 
what their rights are if they want to access, rectify 
or delete their data. Basic elements of transparency 
are the requirements that the information must be 
easily accessible and easy to understand.

•	

In order for processing of personal data to be law‑
ful, personal data should be processed on the ba‑
sis of the explicit consent of the person concerned 
(including withdrawal provisions) or some other 
legitimate basis. 

61

RECOMMENDATIONS | 10RECOMMENDATIONS | PART C:

•	 Consent should be given by any appropriate 
method enabling a freely given specific, informed 
and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s 
wishes, ensuring that individuals are fully aware 
that they give their consent including the ticking of 
a box when visiting an Internet website. Silence or 
inactivity should therefore not constitute consent. 
Any use/transmission of data for a different pur‑
pose than the one consented by the subject data 
(for example e‑commerce or police) should not be 
allowed unless justified by appropriate legislation.

•	 Consent may always be withdrawn without nega‑
tive consequences for the data subject. Data subjects 
should have the right to require that their personal 
data be erased and there will be no further process‑
ing of the data. In principle data previously analysed 
must be deleted unless retention can be justified. 
Informed consent procedures should clarify the 
conditions when withdrawal is not feasible. The data 
controller must be sufficiently certain that the per‑
son giving consent is actually the data subject and 
instruments to certify consent on the use of data (for 
example with digital or electronic signatures) need to 
be established in ICT requiring subjects’ data. 

•	 Children and vulnerable adults deserve specific 
protection of their personal data, as they may be less 
aware of risks, consequences, safeguards and their 
rights in relation to the processing of personal data.

•	

•	

The Group supports the idea underlying the so 
called ‘right to be forgotten’, in the online environ‑
ment the EGE recommends that the right to dele‑
tion of personal data should be extended in such 
a way that any publicly available copies or replica‑
tions should be deleted.

The EGE recommends that the processing of per‑
sonal data of subjects residing in the EU by a con‑
troller not established in the EU/EEA is subjected to 
the EU normative frame on data protection.

5.5  Social Aspects: Digital divide

5.5.1  Digital Divide

Implementing the principles of justice and non‑dis‑
crimination is a key factor to consider in promoting 
the use  of ICT in different societal domains, from 
e‑Government to e‑Health and from e‑Business to 
e‑Services. This use of ICT acquires ethical sensitivity 
when it completely substitutes conventional kinds of 

service provisions and then affects the community 
of European citizens. Innovative forms of commerce, 
administration and health may indeed provide bet‑
ter quality and more sustainable services to citizens. 
This goal is certainly to be sustained and encouraged, 
but those who promote these policies must keep in 
mind that they may affect the principle of participatory 
justice and the access to services by individuals and 
groups who either have no access, cannot or do not 
wish to use these services. 

Society experiences rapid, continuous and incessant 
change. The drive to invent, reinvent and discard al‑
most continuously is a unique human pursuit in an ef‑
fort to deliver progress and prosperity for humankind. 
The society we live in today is dominated by technol‑
ogy and most of us accept that the ever‑changing de‑
velopments in technology have transformed, or have 
the potential to transform, the way we live and relate to 
one another. There are those however, who for a myri‑
ad of reasons, actively choose not to participate in the 
digital arena and as an expression of their personal au‑
tonomy, this choice should be respected. Nonetheless, 
as a consequence of not choosing to incorporate ICT 
into their daily lives, it is likely that these individuals 
will increasingly see their choices being limited in the 
digital age. Notwithstanding that fact, it is important 
is that such ‘digital recluses’ should not be excluded 
from accessing essential services or from meeting their 
societal obligations (e.g. voting, paying taxes) on the 
basis of their decision to eschew digital technologies. 
In the interests of inclusion and solidarity, this places 
a responsibility on wider society to support the provi‑
sion of alternative means of meeting such obligations 
at least in the short to medium term. 

In order to guarantee the right of citizens to play an 
active role in European society while respecting their 
choice of whichever available tools they use to do so, 
the EGE makes the following recommendations:

•	

The EGE recognises that disadvantaged and mar‑
ginalised groups may require different designs, 
content and applications to suit their specific re‑
quirements. To this end, the EGE recommends 
that measures centred around direct provision, 
subsidies and regulation be examined by the EU 
to ensure that such groups are not excluded from 
playing a full and active role in the digital society.

•	

The EGE recognises the efforts of the Commission 
to bridge the digital divide, including collabora‑
tion with international partners, and recommends 

62

Ethics of information and communication technologies10 | RECOMMENDATIONSPART C: | RECOMMENDATIONS

that the EU adopts strategies, which go beyond of‑
fering public access, and incorporate measures to 
ensure that people can make effective use of the 
access. This includes providing people with the 
skills and motivation to harness the potential of ICT 
through educational and mentoring programmes, 
which engage the individual in a process of learn‑
ing, in a way which is meaningful and relevant to 
them.

•	

The EGE recommends that in areas where society 
places obligations on citizens or where access to 
essential services are predicated on ICT use, mecha‑
nisms unrelated to ICT be established in the short 
to medium term. 

5.5.2  Work‑Life Balance

The EGE while recognising the potential benefits of‑
fered by increased connectivity within the sphere of 
work, wishes to highlight the risk of the always‑on 
culture in working life, where ‘flexible working’ can in 
reality mean the flexibility to be working atypical and 
long hours, which can impact negatively on family life. 
The use of ICT needs to be monitored and managed 
effectively by both employee and employer. 

•	

The EGE urges the EU to encourage and support 
organisations to develop explicit policies to en‑
sure the optimal use of ICT while respecting the 
work‑life balance. Such policies should aim to fos‑
ter an organisational culture which does not create 
an expectation that employees should be ‘on‑call’ 
during non‑work hours. This should also be consid‑
ered in the corporate responsibility programmes 
and labour regulations.

5.6  Political participation

The influence ICT may have in shaping the political 
domain raises concerns about citizens’ rights to free 
information, the ability of pressure or special interest 
groups to modify perceptions and the power of the 
State to censor data on the Internet. Due to the massive 
impact of ICT in modern society (as described in the first 
part of this Opinion) governments around the world are 
seeking to interact with the online space with new tools: 
filtering and blocking, registration requirements, surveil‑
lance powers, intermediary liability, etc.). The structure 
of knowledge and communication tools, in all their uses, 
opens questions about the channelling of knowledge 
and information in the digital sphere to shape reality 
and public perception — including the possible spread 

of distorted information through the digital world for 
political purposes. The EGE recommends the following:

•	

•	

•	

The EGE acknowledges that the basic nature of In‑
ternet is the free and active participation of its users. 
The Group highlights the need for keeping the Net 
a free and neutral space. This freedom must not 
contravene the fundamental ethical values of the EU.

The Internet must remain a communication domain 
where freedom of expression is protected from 
censorship within the framework of the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights.

The EGE recognises the need to balance top‑down 
Internet governance by governmental agencies 
with bottom‑up participatory approaches by the 
Internet community. The EGE emphasises the need 
that when the EU, Member States and relevant 
stakeholders deliberate, a transparent and par‑
ticipatory model is appropriately incorporated 
in the decision making process. This applies to all 
regulatory initiatives on ICT. 

5.7  Recommendations Concerning the 

Sphere of Commerce

5.7.1  Commercial Transactions

The EGE underlines the need to defend rights and inter‑
ests of European citizens. It therefore welcomes the ap‑
proach proposed by the European Commission on Cor‑
porate Social Responsibility, advocating that to meet 
their responsibilities, enterprises should have in place 
a process to integrate social, environmental, ethical, hu‑
man rights and consumer concerns into their business 
operations and core strategy in close collaboration with 
their stakeholders (COM(2011) 681 final). The EGE also 
welcomes actions by the EU and international bodies 
to preserve net neutrality (as in COM2011) 222 final); 
however, it underlines the need to apply the measures 
on responsibility (from individuals to companies to so‑
ciety to governments) proposed in this Opinion. Tools 
aiming to achieve these goals, from corporate social 
responsibility (COM2011) 681 final) to a code of conduct 
(actions by the Commission concerning responsible use 
of cloud computing, Internet of things, recommenda‑
tion on responsible innovation ‑ 2012, etc.) should be 
encouraged and their implementation sustained. The 
EGE therefore recommends:

•	

The EGE acknowledges that a balance must be 
found between commercial and non‑commercial 

63

RECOMMENDATIONS | 10RECOMMENDATIONS | PART C:

uses of ICT. The EGE recommends that the Europe‑
an Commission: 1) Using its data protection legisla‑
tion, ensure that social media networks protect the 
data submitted by users in a responsible manner; 
2) Educate users so as to ensure that they under‑
stand that most of the social media networks are 
commercial organisations that need to use data for 
commercial purposes in order to provide the ser‑
vices users enjoy; 3) uses all available means to pro‑
vide a social networking space (probably on existing 
networks) that is free of commercial exploitation, 
for those users who choose it, recognising that the 
users may have to pay for this privilege.

•	

The EGE is of the view that in order for people to 
enter a commercial contract, the terms and condi‑
tions of that contract should be presented to the 
users in clear, concise and intelligible terms.

5.7.2  Corporate Social Responsibility

Protection of privacy is embraced by the principles, in‑
cluding in the Corporate Social Responsibility strategy 
adopted by the European Commission adopted which 
in October 2011. The Strategy describes how enterpris‑
es can benefit from CSR while contributing to society 
as a whole by making every effort to meet their social 
responsibilities. 

•	

The EGE welcomes this initiative and recommends 
that the EU encourages companies to take privacy 
into consideration when applying their CSR poli‑
cy – also using the technological solutions such 
as Privacy impact assessment, Privacy enhancing 
technology and piracy by design.

5.8  Cross‑Correlative Data Mining

Cross‑correlative data mining may be of real signifi‑
cance when databases collected from many sources 
are analysed together to provide information that is 
not contained in the individual databases. Linking 
shopping data collected through store cards with 
bank data and/or health data, for example, provides 
insights into an individual’s habits which may not have 
been immediately obvious. The above actions often 
make use of citizens’ data without their specific con‑
sent for such a use and may allow profiling of unaware 
and uninformed people with possible risks of stigma‑
tisation and violation of privacy. The EGE therefore 
recommends:

•	

Individuals should be explicitly informed by 
businesses, State bodies or research bodies that 
their information may be mined for specific pur‑
poses. This will ensure that individuals can make in‑
formed choices about the services they access and 
use. Specific consent should always be sought when 
databases are correlated. The EGE calls for further 
research into the privacy implications of cross 
correlated data mining, so that this technique can 
serve society in terms of the potential benefits it may 
offer, while protecting the human rights. The Group 
also recommends that the EU further explores if and 
under which conditions sensitive data can or cannot 
be used, including cross‑correlative data mining. 

5.9  Environment and Raw Materials

The area of ICT and the environment is complex: ICT 
may have positive and negative consequences on envi‑
ronment. The impact of ICT on the environment may be 
extremely positive: it may be a tool for the protection of 
environment: monitoring environmental issues, man‑
aging urban environment systems, communicating 
environmental knowledge, disseminating information 
to the public, stimulating active participation of citi‑
zens, enabling efficient use of resources, reducing the 
consumption of energy and essential natural resources 
(e.g. reducing the consumption of paper through elec‑
tronic and paperless communication), bettering the use 
of natural resources. Examples of such transformation 
include using ICT to improve practices in agriculture, 
to monitor air and water pollution, to predict disaster, 
improve the efficiency of the energy, transportation, 
and goods and services sectors. The use of electronic 
devices such as mail or videoconference services may 
also reduce the need for transportation.

At the same time, the sustainability of these technolo‑
gies must also be managed to avoid unintended conse‑
quences such as increased energy consumption, waste 
of used electronic devices and the use of raw materials 
such as rare earth elements. Many electronic devices 
need extensive use of rare elements (such as tantalum, 
lanthanum or dysprosium) and modern batteries need 
large quantities of lithium. The need for such materi‑
als is creating social and environmental problems in 
countries producing the minerals containing these ele‑
ments. At the same time production of some compo‑
nents is limited to some countries. These facts create 
a dependence of energy and raw materials for the use 
of ICT producing an added state of vulnerability that 
has to be taken into account.

64

Ethics of information and communication technologies10 | RECOMMENDATIONSPART C: | RECOMMENDATIONS

•	

•	

•	

The EGE recommends that the ecological effects of 
ICT (use of energy, production of waste and use of 
raw materials) are quantified, recognised, analysed 
and communicated and that exploitation of natural 
resources is minimised. 

The EGE recommends that the EU investigates the 
vulnerability of the ICT system due to the scarcity 
of raw materials.

The  Group  is  aware  that  several  reports  have 
stressed that the production of some minerals 
which are essential raw materials for the production 
of hardware in ICT is carried out under inhuman 
conditions. The Group therefore appeals to the EU 
to work towards the improvement of working con‑
ditions of persons working in this sector, in order to 
respect the human rights. This should also be incor‑
porated in EU financed development programmes.

5.10  Concluding Recommendation

The EGE recognises the potential of the Digital Agenda 
for Europe (DAE) for the European Union, and stresses 
the need to promote a responsible, inclusive and so‑
cially sustainable implementation of this important 
policy sector. The Group therefore advocates the need 
to promote DAE actions in accordance with European 
Union fundamental values. It equally underlines the 
need for education and research in the ethical, legal, 
social and environmental areas to be financed in the 
Horizon 2020 ICT Programmes.

ANNEX 1 PARTIE C:  5 RECOMMANDATIONS

5.1  Cadre éthique de l’avis

En mars 2011, M. le Président José Manuel Barroso 
a demandé au GEE d’élaborer un avis sur les questions 
éthiques que soulève l’expansion rapide des technolo-
gies de l’information et de la communication, déclarant 
que cet avis doit «pouvoir servir de point de référence 
pour la Commission, dans sa promotion d’une utilisa-
tion responsable de l’agenda numérique pour l’Europe 
et dans son action pour faciliter l’acceptation, par la 
société, de cet élément important de sa stratégie».

Le GEE reconnaît le rôle joué par les technologies de 
l’information et de la communication dans la société, 
tant au niveau européen que mondial, et salue les 
efforts de la Commission européenne pour mettre en 
œuvre l’agenda numérique pour l’Europe de façon 
responsable et novatrice. Le groupe souligne éga-
lement les efforts déployés par l’Union européenne 
pour concevoir ses cadres stratégiques conformément 
aux valeurs fondamentales de l’Union européenne et 
souligne la nécessité d’élaborer ce processus de façon 
démocratique et transparente. Les TIC facilitent la 
mondialisation d’une façon qui n’avait pas été prévue 
lorsque le sujet de la mondialisation a été abordé pour 
la première fois, et l’impact de ce nouveau monde glo-
balisé doit être considéré sous l’angle des valeurs fon-
damentales de l’Union européenne.

Conscient qu’il est impossible de couvrir le très large 
éventail des questions que recouvrent les technolo-
gies de l’information et de la communication (TIC), le 
GEE a choisi de se concentrer essentiellement sur les 
technologies Internet. Par conséquent, les questions 
de sécurité posées par les TIC seront examinées par 
le GEE dans un avis ultérieur à remettre à la Commis-
sion, comme demandé par M. le Président Barroso, en 
2013. Le GEE a également décidé de ne pas couvrir les 
questions liées aux droits de propriété intellectuelle et 
prend acte de la controverse que suscitent les négocia-
tions en cours et futures de l’accord commercial anti-
contrefaçon (ACAC).

Les recommandations suivantes du GEE auront par 
conséquent un caractère général et incluront l’accès 
aux TIC, l’identité, le commerce électronique, la pro-
tection de la vie privée, la protection des données et 
diverses questions sociales liées à l’utilisation des TIC 
dans l’Union européenne et dans le monde.

Le présent avis s’inscrit dans le contexte des valeurs et 
droits fondamentaux énoncés dans le traité sur l’Union 
européenne, qui constituent un fondement éthique 
pour les recommandations qu’il contient.

  Article 2: L’Union est fondée sur les valeurs de 
respect de la dignité humaine, de liberté, de 
démocratie, d’égalité, de l’État de droit, ainsi 
que de respect des droits de l’homme, y com-
pris des droits des personnes appartenant à des 
minorités.  Ces valeurs sont communes aux États 
membres dans une société caractérisée par le 
pluralisme, la non-discrimination, la tolérance, la 
justice, la solidarité et l’égalité entre les femmes 
et les hommes.

  Article 3: 1. L’Union a pour but de promouvoir la 
paix, ses valeurs et le bien-être de ses peuples. (…)
3. L’Union établit un marché intérieur.  Elle œuvre 
pour le développement durable de l’Europe fondé 
sur une croissance économique équilibrée et sur la 
stabilité des prix, une économie sociale de marché 
hautement compétitive, qui tend au plein emploi et 
au progrès social, et un niveau élevé de protection 
et d’amélioration de la qualité de l’environnement.  
Elle promeut le progrès scientifique et technique. 
Elle combat l’exclusion sociale et les discrimina-
tions, et promeut la justice et la protection sociales, 
l’égalité entre les femmes et les hommes, la solida-
rité entre les générations et la protection des droits 
de l’enfant. Elle promeut la cohésion économique, 
sociale et territoriale, et la solidarité entre les États 
membres.  Elle respecte la richesse de sa diversité 
culturelle et linguistique, et veille à la sauvegarde 
et  au  développement  du  patrimoine  culturel 
européen. (…)
5. Dans ses relations avec le reste du monde, l’Union 
affirme et promeut ses valeurs et ses intérêts et 
contribue à la protection de ses citoyens.  (…)

Le principal objectif de l’Union dans toutes les poli-
tiques, y compris l’agenda numérique et la gouver-
nance des TIC, est la promotion de ce cadre de valeurs, 
ainsi que l’engagement en faveur de la paix et du 
bien-être des peuples de l’Union. Aux fins de cet avis, 
le groupe souligne particulièrement l’importance des 
principes suivants:

•	

la dignité humaine - la Charte des droits fon-
damentaux de l’Union européenne dispose que 

70

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

«[l] a dignité humaine est inviolable. Elle doit être 
respectée et protégée.» (Article 1);221

le respect de la liberté, qui garantit notamment le 
droit à la communication et à l’agence sans censure 
dans l’ère numérique;

le respect de la démocratie, de la citoyenneté et 
de la participation qui inclut notamment la pro-
tection contre l’exclusion injustifiée et la protection 
contre la discrimination illégale;

le respect de la vie privée qui garantit notamment 
la sphère privée personnelle contre les interven-
tions injustifiées;

le respect de l’autonomie et du consentement 
éclairé qui garantit notamment le droit à l’informa-
tion et au consentement à l’utilisation des données 
ou aux actions qui reposent sur le traitement des 
données;

la justice qui garantit notamment l’égalité d’ac-
cès aux TIC et une répartition équitable de ses 
bénéfices;

la solidarité parmi les citoyens européens a no-
tamment pour objectif l’inclusion de quiconque 
souhaite participer aux TIC, mais elle vise égale-
ment à garantir l’inclusion sociale de ceux qui, par 
exemple, ne peuvent pas participer à des pratiques 
en ligne ou souhaitent maintenir des interactions 
sociales alternatives.

Le GEE salue les nombreuses actions positives déjà 
entreprises par l’Union européenne et ses institutions 
et formule diverses recommandations visant à faire en 
sorte que l’agenda numérique pour l’Europe contribue 
à la prospérité de l’Union tout en respectant les valeurs 
qui la fondent et qu’elle continue de promouvoir.

5.2  Droit d’accès aux TIC

La Charte européenne des droits fondamentaux exige 
que chacun ait la possibilité de contribuer à construire 
la société européenne, ce qui inclut évidemment l’uti-
lisation des TIC. La protection du principe d’égalité 

221  «La dignité de la personne humaine n’est pas seulement un droit 
fondamental en soi, mais constitue la base même des droits 
fondamentaux.» (Déclaration concernant les explications 
relatives à la Charte des droits fondamentaux).

s’applique par conséquent dans plusieurs domaines 
de la vie d’une personne, comme l’éducation, le tra-
vail, le commerce et la santé. Le GEE se félicite des me-
sures prises par la Commission européenne dans le 
secteur des TIC et invite l’Union européenne à parti-
ciper activement et à promouvoir l’accès aux TIC dans 
les sociétés européennes, tout en garantissant l’accès 
aux services sociétaux de base par les citoyens qui 
ne sont pas disposés à utiliser les outils TIC ou qui ne 
sont pas en mesure de les utiliser, en raison de diffi-
cultés techniques, éducatives ou socio-économiques.

•	

•

•	

Le GEE recommande à l’UE de garantir et promou-
voir le droit d’accès à Internet. Le GEE souligne 
que cette approche devrait également être promue 
à l’échelle internationale en accordant une atten-
tion particulière aux régions les moins développées 
du monde.

Le GEE appelle à la mise en place de programmes 
éducatifs permettant aux personnes de dévelop-
per une culture technique et/ou numérique: des 
outils qui visent à simplifier les applications des 
TIC et à accroître la culture numérique au sein de 
la population de l’UE, qui répondent spécialement 
aux attentes des personnes qui ont des besoins 
particuliers et qui informent le public sur la façon 
d’utiliser Internet (par exemple, de la banque en 
ligne à la lecture numérique).

Le GEE appelle à la mise en place de programmes 
éducatifs  qui  responsabilisent  et  sensibilisent 
à l’impact des TIC sur l’identité personnelle, sociale 
et morale de chacun.

Le GEE se félicite des mesures prises par l’UE en 
matière de libre accès et appelle à l’étude de nou-
velles mesures dans ce domaine.

5.3 

 Recommandations concernant l’identité 
individuelle

Les concepts d’identité personnelle – l’identification, 
à savoir l’authentification de l’identité d’un utilisateur 
prenant part aux multiples activités rendues possibles 
par les TIC, et l’identité individuelle, à savoir l’identité 
d’une personne, y compris ses valeurs, ses objectifs, ou 
son auto-interprétation – revêtent de nouvelles formes 
et évoluent considérablement dans l’«ère numérique». 
Dans la partie précédente, le GEE a abordé plusieurs 
défis éthiques qui commandent une analyse et un exa-
men plus approfondis de la question de l’identité. Le 
groupe recommande diverses mesures:

71

RECOMMANDATIONS | 4RECOMMANDATIONS | PARTIE C:

•	

•	

•	

•	

le groupe est d’avis que, pour favoriser l’utilisation 
responsable des TIC envisagée dans l’agenda 
numérique pour l’Europe, l’UE devrait soutenir le 
développement d’outils éducatifs visant à créer et 
à développer chez les utilisateurs une «culture so-
ciale» qui engloberait notamment la responsabilité 
personnelle qu’il y a lieu d’exercer. Des program-
mes tendant à encourager le respect, la tolérance et 
la sensibilité lors de la communication numérique 
devraient être mis en place;

compte tenu de la complexité et de la multiplicité 
croissantes des possibilités offertes par Internet, 
le GEE est d’avis que de nouvelles protections 
devraient être mises en place à l’intention des en-
fants et des adolescents, afin de leur garantir un 
environnement sûr pour apprendre et se divertir. 
Par conséquent, le groupe recommande que des 
activités de sensibilisation ciblant les enfants, les 
adolescents, leurs parents et les enseignants soient 
intégrées aux programmes et actions de l’UE en 
matière d’éducation;

le GEE recommande que l’UE agisse de manière 
à responsabiliser les utilisateurs des TIC, qu’il 
s’agisse de particuliers ou de prestataires de servi-
ces. Ses actions devraient porter sur les questions 
de la responsabilité, de l’identification et de la tra-
çabilité des identités Internet;

le GEE prend acte des études démontrant l’impact 
psychologique de l’utilisation des TIC sur le déve-
loppement personnel. Le groupe recommande 
à l’UE de prendre des mesures de sensibilisation 
à ces changements en promouvant et en finançant 
de nouvelles activités de recherche, et particulière-
ment en mesurant l’impact des TIC sur le dévelop-
pement et les concepts d’identité dans l’initiative 
Horizon 2020.

5.4 

 Le droit à la protection de la vie privée et 
des données à caractère personnel

Il est important que tous ceux qui souhaitent embrasser 
les innovations dans le domaine des TIC se voient faci-
liter la tâche, tout en conservant leur droit à l’autono-
mie et à la vie privée. Il est certes difficile d’expliquer le 
concept de vie privée, mais pour beaucoup, ce concept 
évoque l’«intimité». Ils entendent par là que certains as-
pects de leur vie ne concernent qu’eux. Cette interpré-
tation est fréquemment prolongée par une description 
du concept de vie privée comme étant le droit d’une 
personne de ne pas être dérangée ou comme étant une 

barrière contre toute intrusion du monde extérieur. La 
«vie privée» facilite notre perception de nous-mêmes, 
c’est-à-dire la reconnaissance du fait que nos pensées 
et nos actions nous sont propres, condition essentielle 
à l’attribution d’une responsabilité morale. Cela permet 
à la personne d’exercer un certain degré de contrôle 
sur les informations qu’elle met à la disposition d’autrui, 
préservant de ce fait son autonomie et sa vie privée.

Les personnes doivent disposer d’un contrôle suffisant 
de leurs données en ligne pour être en mesure d’utiliser 
Internet de façon responsable. Il conviendrait donc de 
clarifier les conditions du consentement222 de la per-
sonne concernée, afin de garantir qu’il soit toujours 
accordé en connaissance de cause, et de s’assurer que 
l’intéressé est pleinement conscient qu’il donne son au-
torisation et sait de quel traitement il s’agit, conformé-
ment à l’article 8 de la Charte des droits fondamentaux 
de l’Union européenne. La clarification des notions clés 
peut également favoriser les initiatives en matière d’au-
toréglementation visant à dégager des solutions pra-
tiques conformes au droit de l’Union (Com(2010)°609 
final, 9). Le respect de la vie privée lors de la conception 
(la protection de la vie privée et des données à carac-
tère personnel est prise en compte tout au long du 
cycle de vie des technologies, depuis le stade de leur 
conception jusqu’à leur déploiement, utilisation et éli-
mination finale) devrait être pris en compte dans les 
procédures de consentement éclairé.

Le GEE salue et soutient la proposition de révision du 
cadre réglementaire de l’UE en matière de protection 
des données adoptée par la Commission en janvier 
2012. Il souhaite que, pendant le débat interinstitu-
tionnel sur le cadre réglementaire proposé, les recom-
mandations suivantes soient prises en considération:

•	

le groupe recommande que les caractéristiques 
qualifiant les «données à caractère personnel» 
soient clarifiées, de même que leur application 
à différents usages des TIC (adresses IP, numéros 
RFID uniques, données de géolocalisation) et au 
développement de nouveaux types de données. 
Cette clarification devrait ensuite être intégrée au 

222  La question est cependant compliquée par le fait que, dans 
certains cas, on ne voit pas clairement ce qui constituerait 
un consentement libre, exprès et éclairé à un traitement 
de données, comme dans le domaine de la publicité com-
portementale en ligne où certains considèrent, mais pas 
d’autres, que les paramètres du navigateur de l’internaute 
expriment son consentement.

72

Ethique de biologie synthétique4 | RECOMMANDATIONSPARTIE C: | RECOMMANDATIONS

cadre réglementaire de l’UE en matière de protec-
tion des données;

•	 eu égard aux évolutions technologiques et so-
ciétales, il y a lieu d’examiner les dispositions en 
vigueur concernant les données sensibles, afin de 
déterminer s’il conviendrait d’y soumettre d’autres 
catégories de données et de préciser davantage 
les conditions applicables à leur traitement. Sont 
concernées, par exemple, les données génétiques 
et biométriques;

•	

la transparence est une condition fondamen-
tale pour permettre aux personnes concernées 
d’exercer un contrôle sur leurs propres données 
et pour assurer une protection effective des don-
nées à caractère personnel. Il est donc primordial 
que les responsables du traitement informent les 
personnes concernées correctement et clairement, 
de façon simple et transparente, afin qu’elles sa-
chent qui recueillera et traitera leurs données, se-
lon quelles modalités, pour quels motifs et pendant 
combien de temps, et qu’elles connaissent leurs 
droits en ce qui concerne l’accès à ces données, 
leur rectification ou leur suppression. La transpa-
rence repose sur des éléments fondamentaux, tels 
qu’un accès aisé à l’information, qui doit être facile 
à comprendre;

•	 pour que le traitement des données à caractère 
personnel soit légal, les données à caractère 
personnel devraient être traitées sur la base du 
consentement exprès de la personne concernée 
(incluant un droit de retrait) ou de tout autre fon-
dement légitime;

•	

le consentement devrait être donné par toute 
méthode appropriée permettant une indication 
librement donnée, expresse, éclairée et non ambi-
guë des souhaits de l’intéressé, qui garantisse que 
la personne concernée est pleinement consciente 
qu’elle donne son consentement, notamment en 
cochant une case lorsqu’elle consulte un site Inter-
net. Le silence ou l’inaction ne devraient donc pas 
être constitutifs d’un consentement. Toute utilisa-
tion ou transmission des données dans un but au-
tre que celui consenti par l’intéressé (par exemple, 
commerce électronique ou maintien de l’ordre) ne 
devrait pas être autorisée, sauf si la législation ap-
plicable le justifie;

•	

le  consentement  peut  toujours  être  retiré 
sans  conséquences  négatives  pour  l’intéressé. 

Les personnes concernées devraient avoir le droit 
d’exiger que leurs données à caractère personnel 
soient effacées et ne subissent aucun traitement 
ultérieur. En principe, les données analysées anté-
rieurement doivent être supprimées, sauf si leur 
conservation est justifiable. Les procédures de 
consentement éclairé devraient préciser les condi-
tions dans lesquelles le retrait n’est pas possible. Le 
responsable du traitement doit être suffisamment 
assuré que la personne signifiant son consente-
ment est réellement l’intéressé, et des instruments 
de certification du consentement à l’utilisation des 
données (par exemple, signatures numériques ou 
électroniques) doivent être intégrés dans les TIC re-
quérant la communication de données à caractère 
personnel;

•	

•	

•	

les enfants et les adultes vulnérables requièrent 
une protection particulière, car ils peuvent être 
moins conscients des risques, des conséquences, 
des garanties et des droits liés au traitement de 
leurs données à caractère personnel;

le groupe soutient l’idée du «droit à l’oubli». Dans 
un environnement en ligne, le GEE recommande 
que le droit à la suppression des données à ca-
ractère personnel soit étendu de telle manière 
que les copies ou reproductions accessibles au pu-
blic soient supprimées;

le GEE recommande que le traitement des données 
à caractère personnel des personnes résidant sur le 
territoire de l’UE par un responsable établi en de-
hors de l’UE/EEE soit soumis au cadre normatif de 
l’UE en matière de protection des données.

5.5 

 Aspects sociaux: la fracture numérique

5.5.1  La fracture numérique

L’application des principes de justice et de non-dis-
crimination est un facteur clé à prendre en considé-
ration lorsqu’on promeut l’utilisation des TIC dans 
différents domaines sociétaux, de l’administration 
en ligne à la santé en ligne et du commerce électro-
nique aux services en ligne. Cette utilisation des TIC 
devient éthiquement sensible quand elle se substitue 
complètement aux formes classiques de la prestation 
de services et influe dès lors sur toute la communauté 
des citoyens européens. Les modalités innovantes dans 
les domaines du commerce, de l’administration et de 
la santé peuvent en effet offrir aux citoyens des ser-
vices de meilleure qualité et plus durables. Cet objectif 

73

RECOMMANDATIONS | 4RECOMMANDATIONS | PARTIE C:

mérite certainement d’être soutenu et encouragé, mais 
ceux qui promeuvent ces politiques ne doivent pas ou-
blier que celles-ci peuvent compromettre le principe 
de justice participative et l’accès aux services des per-
sonnes et des groupes qui n’ont pas accès à ces moda-
lités nouvelles ou qui ne peuvent ou ne souhaitent pas 
y recourir.

La  société  connaît  des  changements  rapides, 
constants et incessants. L’inventer, le recyclage et 
l’élimination en quasi-continu sont les manifestations 
d’une quête exclusivement humaine qui vise à faire 
progresser et prospérer l’humanité. La société où nous 
vivons aujourd’hui est dominée par la technologie et 
la plupart d’entre nous admettent que l’évolution 
permanente de la technologie a transformé, ou peut 
transformer, notre manière de vivre et nos relations 
réciproques. Certains toutefois, pour une foule de rai-
sons, choisissent de ne pas prendre part à la société 
numérique, exprimant ainsi leur autonomie person-
nelle. Leur choix doit être respecté, bien qu’il soit 
probable qu’en refusant d’intégrer les TIC dans leur 
vie quotidienne, ces personnes voient le champ de 
leurs options rétrécir de plus en plus dans l’ère nu-
mérique. En dépit de cela, il importe que ces «reclus 
numériques» ne soient pas privés de la possibilité 
d’accéder à des services essentiels ou de s’acquitter 
de leurs obligations sociétales (par exemple le vote 
ou le paiement de l’impôt) du fait de leur rejet des 
technologies numériques. Dans l’intérêt de l’inclusion 
et de la solidarité, la société au sens large se voit donc 
tenue de favoriser la fourniture de moyens alternatifs 
de satisfaire à ces obligations, ne serait-ce qu’à court 
ou moyen terme.

Pour garantir aux citoyens leur droit de jouer un rôle 
actif dans la société européenne tout en respectant 
leurs choix en matière d’outils utilisables à cet effet, le 
GEE formule les recommandations suivantes:

•	

le GEE reconnaît que les groupes désavantagés 
et marginalisés peuvent requérir des conceptions, 
applications et contenus différents pour répondre 
à leurs besoins spécifiques. À cet effet, le GEE re-
commande que des mesures axées sur la fourniture 
directe, les subventions et la réglementation soient 
examinées par l’UE, afin que ces groupes ne soient 
pas privés de la possibilité de jouer pleinement un 
rôle actif dans la société numérique;

•	

le GEE reconnaît les efforts consentis par la Com-
mission  pour  réduire  la  fracture  numérique, 
y compris sa collaboration avec des partenaires 

internationaux, et recommande que l’UE adopte 
des stratégies qui ne consistent pas seulement à ou-
vrir l’accès au public mais qui intègrent également 
des mesures permettant un exercice effectif de cet 
accès. Cela implique d’instruire le public et de le 
motiver à tirer parti du potentiel des TIC au moyen 
de programmes éducatifs et de tutorat, qui eng-
agent chacun dans un processus d’apprentissage 
utile et judicieux;

•	

le GEE recommande que, dans les domaines où 
la société impose des obligations aux citoyens ou 
dans lesquels l’accès aux services essentiels repo-
se sur l’utilisation des TIC, des mécanismes indé-
pendants des TIC soient établis à court ou moyen 
terme.

5.5.2 

 Équilibre entre vie professionnelle et vie privée

Tout en reconnaissant les avantages potentiels d’une 
connectivité accrue dans la sphère du travail, le GEE 
souhaite mettre en évidence le risque de la culture 
de la «connexion permanente» dans la vie profession-
nelle, où «travail flexible» pourrait être synonyme de 
travail à toute heure et sans limite, avec de possibles 
incidences négatives sur la vie de famille. L’utilisation 
des TIC doit être surveillée et gérée efficacement à la 
fois par l’employé et l’employeur.

•	

Le GEE invite l’UE à encourager et aider les orga-
nisations à élaborer des politiques explicites ga-
rantissant une utilisation optimale des TIC dans le 
respect de l’équilibre entre vie professionnelle 
et vie privée. Ces politiques devraient viser à en-
courager une culture organisationnelle qui ne sous-
entende pas que les employés sont «d’astreinte» 
en dehors des heures de travail. Ce point devrait 
également être abordé dans les programmes en 
matière de responsabilité des entreprises et dans 
la réglementation du travail.

5.6 

 Participation politique

L’influence que les TIC peuvent avoir sur le domaine 
politique soulève des inquiétudes en ce qui concerne 
le droit des citoyens à la libre information, la capacité 
des groupes d’intérêts ou de pression à modifier les 
perceptions et le pouvoir de l’État de censurer des 
données sur Internet. Compte tenu de l’impact massif 
des TIC sur la société moderne (comme décrit dans la 
première partie du présent avis), les gouvernements 
du monde entier cherchent à interagir avec l’espace 
en ligne à l’aide de nouveaux outils: filtrage, exigences 

74

Ethique de biologie synthétique4 | RECOMMANDATIONSPARTIE C: | RECOMMANDATIONS

d’enregistrement, pouvoirs de surveillance, responsa-
bilité des intermédiaires, etc.). La structure des outils de 
la connaissance et de la communication, tous usages 
confondus, soulève la question de l’orientation de la 
connaissance et de l’information dans la sphère numé-
rique dans le but de façonner la réalité et la perception 
du public – y compris la diffusion possible d’informa-
tions faussées via les canaux numériques à des fins 
politiques. Le GEE recommande ce qui suit:

•	

•	

•	

le  GEE  reconnaît  que  le  trait  fondamental  de 
l’Internet est la participation libre et active de ses 
utilisateurs. Le groupe souligne la nécessité de fai-
re en sorte que le Net reste un espace libre et 
neutre. Cette liberté ne doit pas aller à l’encontre 
des valeurs éthiques fondamentales de l’UE;

l’Internet doit rester un domaine de communi-
cation où la liberté d’expression est protégée 
contre la censure dans le cadre de la Charte des 
droits fondamentaux;

le GEE reconnaît la nécessité de contrebalancer la 
gouvernance descendante de l’Internet par des 
organismes gouvernementaux appliquant des ap-
proches participatives ascendantes qui associent 
la communauté Internet. Il souligne qu’un modèle 
transparent et participatif devrait être dûment 
intégré au processus décisionnel associant l’UE, 
les États membres et les parties prenantes, et ce 
pour toute initiative en matière de réglementation 
des TIC.

5.7 

 Recommandations au sujet de la sphère 
du commerce

(des particuliers aux entreprises, en passant par la 
société et les gouvernements) proposées dans le pré-
sent avis. La mise en place et en œuvre d’outils visant 
à atteindre ces objectifs, de la responsabilité sociale 
des entreprises (COM(2011) 681 final) à un code de 
conduite (actions menées par la Commission au sujet 
de l’utilisation responsable de l’informatique en nuage 
et de l’Internet des objets, recommandation concer-
nant l’innovation responsable - 2012, etc.) devrait être 
encouragée et soutenue. Le GEE recommande donc 
ce qui suit:

•	

le GEE constate qu’un équilibre doit être trouvé 
entre les utilisations commerciales et non com-
merciales des TIC. Il recommande à la Commission 
européenne: 1) de s’assurer, en se fondant sur sa 
législation en matière de protection des données, 
que les réseaux de médias sociaux protègent de 
façon responsable les données communiquées par 
les utilisateurs; 2) d’éduquer les utilisateurs de sorte 
qu’ils comprennent que la plupart des réseaux de 
médias sociaux sont des organisations commercia-
les qui doivent utiliser les données à des fins com-
merciales pour pouvoir fournir aux utilisateurs les 
services dont ils profitent; 3) d’employer tous les 
moyens disponibles pour offrir aux utilisateurs qui 
le souhaitent un espace de réseautage social (pro-
bablement sur les réseaux existants) qui soit exem-
pt d’exploitation commerciale, sachant que les uti-
lisateurs pourraient devoir payer pour ce privilège;

•	

le GEE est d’avis qu’aux fins de la conclusion d’un 
contrat commercial, les conditions de ce contrat 
doivent être présentées aux utilisateurs dans des 
termes clairs, concis et intelligibles.

5.7.1  Les transactions commerciales

5.7.2  Responsabilité sociale des entreprises

Le GEE souligne la nécessité de défendre les droits 
et  intérêts  des  citoyens  européens.  Il  salue  donc 
l’approche proposée par la Commission européenne 
en matière de responsabilité sociale des entreprises, 
selon laquelle, pour s’acquitter de leur responsabi-
lité, les entreprises doivent engager, en collaboration 
étroite avec les parties prenantes, un processus des-
tiné à intégrer les préoccupations en matière sociale, 
environnementale, éthique, de droits de l’homme et 
des consommateurs dans leurs activités commerciales 
et leur stratégie de base (COM(2011) 681 final). Le GEE 
salue également les actions de l’UE et des organismes 
internationaux pour préserver la neutralité du Net 
(COM(2011) 222 final); toutefois, il souligne la nécessité 
d’appliquer les mesures en matière de responsabilité 

La protection de la vie privée est couverte par une série 
de principes, notamment ceux repris dans la stratégie 
de responsabilité sociale des entreprises (RSE) adop-
tée par la Commission européenne en octobre 2011. 
La stratégie explique comment les entreprises peuvent 
tirer parti de la RSE tout en contribuant à la société 
dans son ensemble en faisant tout leur possible pour 
s’acquitter de leurs responsabilités sociales.

•	

Le GEE se félicite de cette initiative et recomman-
de à l’UE d’encourager les entreprises à prendre 
en considération la vie privée dans l’application 
de leur politique de RSE – tout en utilisant les so-
lutions technologiques relatives à l’évaluation des 
répercussions sur la vie privée, au renforcement du

respect de la vie privée et à la protection intégrée 
de la vie privée.

 Exploration de données par corrélation 
croisée

L’exploration de données par corrélation croisée peut 
présenter un intérêt réel lorsque des bases de don-
nées collectées auprès de diverses sources sont ana-
lysées ensemble pour détecter des informations qui 
ne sont pas contenues dans des bases déterminées. 
Par exemple, le fait de relier des données d’achats par 
cartes de magasin à des données bancaires et/ou de 
santé peut donner un éclairage sur des comportements 
individuels qui n’étaient éventuellement pas immédia-
tement évidents. Ce type de corrélation exploite sou-
vent les données de citoyens sans le consentement 
exprès de ceux-ci et peut déboucher sur un profilage 
dissimulé et non consenti, avec un possible risque de 
stigmatisation et de violation de la vie privée. Le GEE 
recommande donc ce qui suit:

•	

les personnes concernées devraient être ex-
pressément informées par les entreprises, les 
instances nationales ou les organismes de recher-
che du fait que leurs informations peuvent faire 
l’objet d’une exploration à des fins spécifiques. Les 
intéressés pourront ainsi faire des choix éclairés 
au sujet des services auxquels elles accèdent et 
qu’elles utilisent. Le consentement exprès devrait 
toujours être sollicité lorsque des bases de don-
nées sont mises en corrélation. Le GEE préconise 
une réflexion approfondie au sujet des réper-
cussions sur la vie privée de l’exploration de 
données par corrélation croisée, de sorte que 
cette technique puisse rendre service à la soci-
été en raison de ses avantages potentiels, tout 
en protégeant les droits humains. Le groupe re-
commande également que l’UE réfléchisse plus 
avant à la question de savoir si, et dans quelles 
conditions, les données sensibles peuvent être 
utilisées, y compris au moyen d’un exploration 
par corrélation croisée.

5.9 

 Environnement et matières premières

La problématique des TIC et de l’environnement est 
complexe: les TIC peuvent avoir des conséquences 
positives et négatives sur l’environnement. L’impact 
des TIC sur l’environnement peut être extrêmement 
positif. Ce peut être un outil pour la protection de 
l’environnement:  suivi  des  questions  environne-
mentales, gestion des systèmes environnementaux 

urbains, communication des connaissances environne-
mentales, diffusion de l’information auprès du public, 
stimulation de la participation active des citoyens, 
promotion de l’utilisation efficace des ressources, 
réduction de la consommation d’énergie et de res-
sources naturelles essentielles (par exemple, réduction 
de la consommation de papier grâce à la communica-
tion électronique ou sans papier), amélioration de l’uti-
lisation des ressources naturelles. Les exemples d’une 
telle transformation incluent l’utilisation des TIC pour 
améliorer les pratiques agricoles, surveiller la pollution 
de l’air et de l’eau, prévoir les catastrophes et amélio-
rer l’efficacité des secteurs de l’énergie, du transport, 
ainsi que des biens et services. L’utilisation de disposi-
tifs électroniques tels que les services de messagerie 
électronique ou de vidéoconférence peut également 
réduire le besoin de transport.

En même temps, la durabilité de ces technologies doit 
également être gérée pour éviter des conséquences 
non  voulues  telles  que  la  consommation  accrue 
d’énergie, les déchets issus des dispositifs électro-
niques usagés et l’utilisation de matières premières 
telles que des éléments de terres rares. De nombreux 
dispositifs électroniques nécessitent une exploitation 
extensive d’éléments rares (tels que le tantale, le lan-
thane ou le dysprosium) et les batteries modernes ont 
besoin de grandes quantités de lithium. La demande 
de ces matières crée des problèmes sociaux et envi-
ronnementaux dans les pays où l’on extrait les mine-
rais qui les contiennent. En même temps, la produc-
tion de certains composants est limitée à quelques 
pays. Ces faits créent une dépendance envers l’éner-
gie et les matières premières pour l’utilisation des TIC, 
produisant un état de vulnérabilité accrue qui doit 
être pris en compte.

•	

•	

•	

Le GEE recommande que les effets écologiques des 
TIC (utilisation de l’énergie, production de déchets 
et utilisation des matières premières) soient quan-
tifiés, identifiés, analysés et communiqués, et que 
l’exploitation des ressources naturelles soit réduite 
au minimum.

Le GEE recommande à l’UE d’étudier la vulnérabilité 
du système des TIC, compte tenu de la rareté des 
matières premières.

Le groupe sait que plusieurs rapports ont souligné 
que l’extraction de certains minerais constituant 
des matières premières essentielles à la fabrication 
des équipements de TIC est effectuée dans des con-
ditions inhumaines. Le groupe appelle donc l’UE 

76

Ethique de biologie synthétique4 | RECOMMANDATIONSPARTIE C: | RECOMMANDATIONS

à œuvrer à l’amélioration des conditions de travail 
dans ce secteur, afin de faire respecter les droits de 
l’homme. Ce point devrait également être intégré 
dans les programmes de développement financés 
par l’UE.

5.10  Recommandation finale

Le GEE reconnaît le potentiel de l’agenda numérique 
pour l’Europe et souligne la nécessité de promouvoir 
une mise en œuvre responsable, inclusive et sociale-
ment durable de cet important secteur stratégique. 
Le groupe plaide donc en faveur de la promotion des 
mesures s’inscrivant dans le cadre de l’agenda numé-
rique pour l’Europe dans le respect des valeurs fonda-
mentales de l’Union européenne. Il souligne également 
la nécessité de financer l’éducation et la recherche sur 
le plan éthique, juridique, social et environnemental 
dans le volet TIC de l’initiative Horizon 2020.

ANNEX 2 TEIL C:  5 EMPFEHLUNGEN

5.1 

 Ethischer Rahmen der Stellungnahme

Präsident José Manuel Barroso hat die EGE im März 
2011 um eine Stellungnahme zu den ethischen Fragen, 
die sich aus der raschen Ausdehnung von Informations- 
und Kommunikationstechnologien (IKT) ergeben, er-
sucht und unterstrichen, dass die Stellungnahme der 
Kommission als Bezugspunkt für die Förderung eines 
verantwortungsvollen Umgangs mit der Digitalen 
Agenda für Europa dienen und die Akzeptanz eines 
derart wichtigen politischen Anliegens in der Gesell-
schaft erleichtern könnte.

Die EGE erkennt an, dass Informations- und Kommu-
nikationstechnologien eine wichtige gesellschaftliche 
Rolle in Europa und der gesamten Welt spielen, und sie 
begrüßt die Bemühungen der Europäischen Kommissi-
on um eine verantwortungsvolle und innovative Um-
setzung der Digitalen Agenda für Europa. Die Gruppe 
möchte zudem die Anstrengungen hervorheben, die 
die Europäische Union unternimmt, um ihre politischen 
Rahmen in Übereinstimmung mit den Grundwerten 
der Europäischen Union zu gestalten, und sie weist da-
rauf hin, dass dieser Prozess demokratisch und trans-
parent sein muss. Informations- und Kommunikations-
technologien eröffnen Globalisierungsmöglichkeiten, 
die zu Zeiten, als das Thema Globalisierung erstmals 
erörtert wurde, noch unvorstellbar waren, und die Aus-
wirkungen dieser neuen, globalisierten Welt müssen 
im Lichte der Grundwerte der Europäischen Union be-
trachtet werden.

Die EGE hat sich vor allem mit den Internettechnologi-
en befasst, weil ihr bewusst ist, dass es nicht möglich 
ist, die gesamte umfangreiche Palette der mit dem IKT-
Bereich zusammenhängenden Themen zu behandeln. 
Die sich aus den IKT ergebenden Sicherheitsfragen 
werden daher in einer nachfolgenden Stellungnahme 
der EGE behandelt werden, die der Kommission auf 
Ersuchen von Präsident Barroso im Jahr 2013 vorzu-
legen ist. Die EGE hat sich zudem dafür entschieden, 
nicht auf das Thema Rechte an geistigem Eigentum 
einzugehen, und sie ist sich auch der Kontroverse um 
die laufenden und die künftigen Verhandlungen über 
das Anti-Produktpiraterie-Handelsabkommen ACTA 
bewusst.

der Privatsphäre, Datenschutz und bestimmte soziale 
Fragen im Zusammenhang mit der Nutzung von IKT in 
der EU und der gesamten Welt.

Diese Stellungnahme fußt auf den im Vertrag über die 
Europäische Union verankerten Grundrechten und 
Werten, die auch die ethische Grundlage für die Emp-
fehlungen bilden.

  Artikel 2: Die Werte, auf die sich die Union grün-
det, sind die Achtung der Menschenwürde, Freiheit, 
Demokratie, Gleichheit, Rechtsstaatlichkeit und die 
Wahrung der Menschenrechte einschließlich der 
Rechte der Personen, die Minderheiten angehören. 
Diese Werte sind allen Mitgliedstaaten in einer Ge-
sellschaft gemeinsam, die sich durch Pluralismus, 
Nichtdiskriminierung, Toleranz, Gerechtigkeit, Soli-
darität und die Gleichheit von Frauen und Männern 
auszeichnet.

  Artikel 3: 1. Ziel der Union ist es, den Frieden, ihre 
Werte und das Wohlergehen ihrer Völker zu för-
dern. (…)
3. Die Union errichtet einen Binnenmarkt. Sie wirkt 
auf die nachhaltige Entwicklung Europas auf der 
Grundlage eines ausgewogenen Wirtschaftswachs-
tums und von Preisstabilität, eine in hohem Maße 
wettbewerbsfähige soziale Marktwirtschaft, die auf 
Vollbeschäftigung und sozialen Fortschritt abzielt, 
sowie ein hohes Maß an Umweltschutz und Ver-
besserung der Umweltqualität hin. Sie fördert den 
wissenschaftlichen und technischen Fortschritt. Sie 
bekämpft soziale Ausgrenzung und Diskriminierun-
gen und fördert soziale Gerechtigkeit und sozialen 
Schutz, die Gleichstellung von Frauen und Män-
nern, die Solidarität zwischen den Generationen 
und den Schutz der Rechte des Kindes. Sie fördert 
den wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und territorialen 
Zusammenhalt und die Solidarität zwischen den 
Mitgliedstaaten. Sie wahrt den Reichtum ihrer kul-
turellen und sprachlichen Vielfalt und sorgt für den 
Schutz und die Entwicklung des kulturellen Erbes 
Europas. (…)
5. In ihren Beziehungen zur übrigen Welt schützt 
und fördert die Union ihre Werte und Interessen 
und trägt zum Schutz ihrer Bürgerinnen und Bürger 
bei. (…)

Die nachfolgenden Empfehlungen der EGE sind daher 
allgemeiner Art und beziehen sich auf die Themen Zu-
gang zu IKT, Identität, elektronischer Handel, Schutz 

Die Förderung dieses Werterahmens bildet zusammen 
mit dem Eintreten für den Frieden und für den Wohl-
stand aller EU-Bürger das Hauptziel, das die Union in 

 
 
 
 
 
TEIL C: | EMPFEHLUNGEN

RECOMMANDATIONS | 4

all ihren Politikbereichen einschließlich der Digitalen 
Agenda und der IKT-Governance verfolgt. Bei dieser 
Stellungnahme hat die Gruppe vor allem auf folgende 
Grundsätze besonderes Augenmerk gelegt:

•	 Menschenwürde: Die Charta der Grundrechte 
der Europäischen Union besagt: „Die Würde des 
Menschen ist unantastbar. Sie ist zu achten und zu 
schützen.“ (Artikel 1);223 

•	 Wahrung  der  Freiheit  und  insbesondere  des 
Rechts auf eine zensurfreie Kommunikation und 
Agentur im digitalen Zeitalter;

•	 Wahrung von Demokratie, Bürgerrechten und 
Bürgerbeteiligung einschließlich Schutz vor Aus-
grenzung und unzulässiger Diskriminierung;

•	 Wahrung  der  Privatsphäre  einschließlich 
Schutz vor ungerechtfertigten Eingriffen in die 
Privatsphäre;

nach wie vor anstrebt, zum Blühen und Gedeihen der 
Union beitragen kann. 

5.2 

 Recht auf Zugang zu IKT

Die Europäische Charta der Grundrechte sieht vor, 
dass jede Person die Möglichkeit haben muss, einen 
Betrag zur Gestaltung der europäischen Gesellschaft 
zu leisten, was natürlich auch die Nutzung von IKT ein-
schließt. Der Schutz des Gleichheitsprinzips ist daher 
in mehreren Lebensbereichen wie Bildung, Beschäf-
tigung, Handel und Gesundheit von besonderer Be-
deutung. Die EGE begrüßt die von der Europäischen 
Kommission im IKT-Bereich ergriffenen Maßnahmen 
und ersucht die EU, sich an der Nutzung von IKT in den 
europäischen Gesellschaftssystemen zu beteiligen und 
den Zugang zu IKT zu fördern, gleichzeitig aber auch 
Bürgern, die aus technischen, bildungsspezifischen 
oder sozioökonomischen Gründen nicht auf IKT-Werk-
zeuge zurückgreifen können oder wollen, den Zugang 
zu grundlegenden sozialen Diensten zu garantieren. 

•	 Wahrung der Selbständigkeit und Aufklärungs-
pflicht bei Einwilligungen, u.a. zum Schutz des 
Rechts auf Information und auf Aufklärung im Vor-
feld einer Zustimmung zur Datenverwendung oder 
zu sich auf die Verarbeitung dieser Daten gründen-
den Maßnahmen;

•	 Die EGE empfiehlt der EU, das Recht auf Zugang 
zum Internet zu wahren und zu stärken. Die EGE 
betont, dass ein solches Vorgehen auch auf inter-
nationaler Ebene gefördert und dabei besonderes 
Gewicht auf die weniger entwickelten Regionen der 
Welt gelegt werden sollte.

•	 Gerechtigkeit, u.a. zwecks Sicherstellung eines 
gleichberechtigten Zugangs zu IKT und einer ge-
rechten Nutzung ihrer Vorteile;

•	 Solidarität unter den EU-Bürgern, u.a. zwecks 
Einbeziehung von jedem, der an IKT mitwirken 
möchte, aber auch zur Sicherstellung der gesell-
schaftlichen Eingliederung von Personen, die sich 
beispielsweise nicht an Online-Praktiken beteiligen 
können oder alternative soziale Interaktionsformen 
beibehalten möchten.   

Die EGE begrüßt die positiven Maßnahmen, die die 
Europäische Union und ihre Organe bereits ergriffen 
haben und unterbreitet nachfolgend eine Reihe von 
Empfehlungen, durch die sichergestellt werden soll, 
dass die Europäische Digitale Agenda unter Wahrung 
der Werte, auf die sich Europa gründet und die Europa 

223 

„Die Würde des Menschen ist nicht nur ein Grundrecht an sich, 
sondern bildet das eigentliche Fundament der Grundrechte.“ (Er-
klärung zu den Erläuterungen zur Charta der Grundrechte).

•	 Die EGE fordert die Einrichtung von Bildungs-
programmen, durch die der Einzelne in die Lage 
versetzt wird, seine technische und/oder digitale 
Kompetenz zu verbessern (z.B. durch Werkzeuge 
zur Vereinfachung von IKT-Anwendungen), und die 
auf die Verbesserung der digitalen Kompetenz der 
gesamten EU-Bevölkerung abstellen und sich ins-
besondere mit den Anforderungen von Menschen 
mit besonderen Bedürfnissen befassen (Werkzeuge 
zum Erlernen des Umgangs mit dem Internet, an-
gefangen beim Internetbanking bis hin zu elektro-
nischen Büchern).

•	 Die EGE fordert die Einrichtung von Bildungspro-
grammen zur Sensibilisierung für die Auswirkungen 
der IKT auf die persönliche, gesellschaftliche und 
moralische Identität des Einzelnen und zur Schaf-
fung eines größeren Verantwortungsbewusstseins 
für diese Identität.

•	 Die EGE begrüßt die von der EU ergriffenen Maß-
nahmen zur Förderung eines offenen Zugangs 
und regt an, dass weitere Maßnahmen auf diesem 
Gebiet sondiert werden sollten.

5.3 

 Empfehlungen zum Thema individuelle 
Identität

Konzepte, die sich mit der persönlichen Identität des 
Einzelnen (d.h. mit der Identifizierung zwecks Prüfung 
der Echtheit eines sich mit den zahlreichen durch IKT 
ermöglichten Tätigkeiten befassenden Nutzers und 
mit der individuellen Identität einer Person und ihrer 
Werte, Ziele oder Selbstsicht) befassen,  nehmen im 
„digitalen Zeitalter“ neue Formen an und unterliegen 
einem starken Wandel. Die EGE hat im vorhergehenden 
Teil verschiedene ethische Herausforderungen ange-
sprochen, die in Bezug auf die Frage der Identität der 
weiteren Analyse und Prüfung bedürfen, und die Grup-
pe empfiehlt diesbezüglich folgende Maßnahmen:   

•	 Um eine verantwortungsvolle Nutzung der in 
der Digitalen Agenda für Europa vorgesehenen 
IKT zu fördern, sollte die EU nach Auffassung der 
Gruppe die Entwicklung von Bildungswerkzeugen 
unterstützen, die dazu dienen, eine „soziale Kom-
petenz“ der Nutzer zu schaffen und auszuprägen; 
dies schließt die Unterstützung eines eigenverant-
wortlichen Handelns ein. Es sollten einschlägige 
Programme aufgelegt werden, die auf die Förde-
rung von Respekt, Toleranz und Einfühlungsver-
mögen bei der digitalen Kommunikation abstellen. 

•	 Da die vom Internet gebotenen Möglichkeiten im-
mer zahlreicher und immer komplexer werden, ist 
die EGE der Auffassung, dass zusätzliche Sicher-
heitsvorkehrungen für Kinder und Jugendli-
che getroffen werden sollten, damit diese in einer 
sicheren Umgebung lernen und spielen können. 
In diesem Sinne empfiehlt die Gruppe die Integra-
tion von Aufklärungsmaßnahmen für Kinder und 
Jugendliche und ihre Eltern und Lehrer in die Bil-
dungsprogramme und die politischen Maßnahmen 
der EU.

•	 Die EGE empfiehlt der EU, Mittel zur Stärkung des 
Verantwortungsbewusstseins der Nutzer und der 
Anbieter von IKT-Diensten bereitzustellen. Konkret 
sollte es dabei um die Themen Rechenschafts-
pflicht, Identifizierung und Rückverfolgbarkeit der 
Internetidentität gehen. 

•	 Die  EGE  hat  die  Studien,  die  die  psychologi-
schen Auswirkungen der Nutzung von IKT auf 
die persönliche Entwicklung aufgezeigt haben, 
zur Kenntnis genommen. Die Gruppe empfiehlt 
der EU, das Bewusstsein für diese Veränderun-
gen zu schärfen und zu diesem Zweck weitere 

Forschungsmaßnahmen  auf  diesem  Gebiet  zu 
fördern und zu finanzieren und insbesondere die 
Auswirkungen von IKT auf die Entwicklung und die 
Identitätskonzepte im Rahmen von „Horizont 2020“ 
zu überwachen.  

5.4  Das Recht auf Privatsphäre und 

Datenschutz

Für Menschen, die von IKT-Innovationen Gebrauch 
machen wollen, ist es wichtig, dass sie dabei unter-
stützt werden, gleichzeitig aber ihre Eigenständigkeit 
und ihre Privatsphäre gewahrt bleiben. Obschon der 
Begriff „Privatsphäre“ nicht einfach zu erklären ist, ha-
ben doch die meisten Menschen das Empfinden, dass 
bestimmte Aspekte ihres Lebens nur sie selbst etwas 
angehen. Dass „Privatsphäre“ regelmäßig als der nicht-
öffentliche Bereich definiert wird, in dem ein Mensch 
unbehelligt von äußeren Einflüssen sein Recht auf freie 
Entfaltung der Persönlichkeit wahrnehmen kann, stärkt 
dieses Empfinden. Die Privatsphäre erleichtert dem 
Menschen das Verständnis von sich selbst, sprich: die 
Erkenntnis, dass sein Denken und sein Handeln sein 
eigen sind, was wiederum eine wesentliche Voraus-
setzung dafür ist, dass er moralische Verantwortung 
übernehmen kann. Dies ermöglicht dem Einzelnen, 
ein gewisses Maß an Kontrolle über die Informationen 
auszuüben, die er anderen gibt und so seine Eigenstän-
digkeit und seine Privatsphäre zu wahren.

Um das Internet verantwortungsvoll nutzen zu können, 
benötigt jeder Mensch hinreichende Kontrolle über sei-
ne Onlinedaten. Daher sollten die Bedingungen für die 
Einwilligung der betroffenen Person224 stets klargestellt 
werden, damit gewährleistet ist, dass die Einwilligung 
nach erfolgter Aufklärung erteilt wurde („informierte 
Einwilligung“) und die betroffene Person sich vollauf 
darüber im Klaren war, dass sie einer Verarbeitung ihrer 
Daten im Sinne von Artikel 8 der Charta der Grundrech-
te der Europäischen Union zustimmt und welche Fol-
gen dies hat. Klarheit über Schlüsselbegriffe kann zu-
dem der Entwicklung von Selbstregulierungsinitiativen 
zur Ausarbeitung von praktischen, im Einklang mit dem 
EU-Recht stehenden Lösungen förderlich sein (siehe 

224  Ein erschwerender Umstand ist allerdings, dass in manchen 
Fällen gar nicht klar ist, worin die betreffende aus freiem 
Willen und nach vorheriger Aufklärung erteilte Zustim-
mung zu einer spezifischen Datenverarbeitung besteht. 
Dies gilt beispielsweise für die verhaltensorientierte Wer-
bung im Internet, bei der die Einwilligung des Nutzers nach 
Auffassung mancher (aber eben nicht aller) im Wege der 
Browsereinstellungen erteilt wird.

 
 
 
TEIL C: | EMPFEHLUNGEN

RECOMMANDATIONS | 4

KOM (2010) 609 endg., S. 9). Fester Bestandteil aller eine 
„informierte Einwilligung“ voraussetzenden Verfahren 
sollte daher ein „eingebauter Datenschutz“ sein (d.h. 
der Schutz der Privatsphäre und der Datenschutz wer-
den in den gesamten Lebenszyklus von Technologien 
eingebettet, angefangen bei der Konzeption über die 
Einführung und Verwendung bis hin zur Abschaffung).

Die EGE begrüßt und befürwortet den Vorschlag zur 
Neufassung des EU-Datenschutzrahmens, den die 
Kommission im Januar 2012 angenommen hat. Die 
Gruppe hat betont, dass bei der interinstitutionellen 
Debatte über den Vorschlag folgende Empfehlungen 
berücksichtigt werden sollten:

•	 Die Gruppe empfiehlt, dass klargestellt werden 
sollte, welche Merkmale Daten zu personenbe-
zogenen Daten machen, welche Bedeutung dies 
für die verschiedenen Nutzungsformen von IKT 
(IP-Adressen, RFID-Nummern, Geolokationsdaten 
usw.) hat, und wie sich dies auf die Entwicklung 
neuer Datenarten auswirkt. Diese Präzisierungen 
sollten sodann in den Datenschutzrahmen der EU 
einfließen. 

•	

Es ist angesichts der technologischen und der sons-
tigen gesellschaftlichen Entwicklung notwendig, 
die geltenden Bestimmungen über sensible Daten 
zu überdenken, zu prüfen, ob andere Datenkate-
gorien hinzugefügt werden sollten und näher zu 
klären, unter welchen Bedingungen sie verarbeitet 
werden dürfen. Beispielsweise betrifft dies geneti-
sche und biometrische Daten.

•	 Transparenz ist eine grundlegende Vorausset-
zung für die Kontrolle des Einzelnen über seine 
Daten und für einen wirksamen Schutz personen-
bezogener Daten. Daher ist es von wesentlicher 
Bedeutung, dass jeder Einzelne von dem für die 
Verarbeitung seiner Daten Verantwortlichen auf 
einfache und transparente Weise hinreichend 
darüber aufgeklärt wird, wie, von wem, aus wel-
chen Gründen und für welchen Zeitraum seine 
Daten gesammelt und verarbeitet werden, und 
welche Rechte er hat, wenn er seine Daten ein-
sehen, berichtigen oder löschen möchte. Grund-
legender Bestandteil dieser Transparenz ist die 
Anforderung, dass diese Informationen ohne 
Weiteres verfügbar und leicht verständlich sein 
müssen.

Daten stets auf der Grundlage einer ausdrückli-
chen Einwilligung der betroffenen Person (mit 
Bestimmungen über das Recht auf Rücknahme der 
Einwilligung) oder auf einer sonstigen zulässigen 
Rechtsgrundlage verarbeitet werden. 

•	 Die Einwilligung sollte in jeder geeigneten Form 
möglich sein, so dass die betroffene Person ihre 
Wünsche frei, konkret, informiert und unzweideutig 
zum Ausdruck bringen kann und damit sicherge-
stellt ist, dass sich der Einzelne vollauf bewusst ist, 
dass er seine Einwilligung erteilt (beispielsweise 
durch Ankreuzen eines Kästchens auf einer Websei-
te). Wenn keine Äußerung oder Handlung erfolgt, 
sollte dies mithin keine Einwilligung darstellen. 
Jede Verwendung oder Übermittlung von Daten zu 
einem anderen als dem von der betroffenen Person 
gebilligten Zweck (z.B. im elektronischen Handel 
oder zu polizeilichen Zwecken) sollte nur zulässig 
sein, wenn dies einschlägige Rechtsvorschriften so 
vorsehen.

•	 Die Einwilligung sollte jederzeit widerrufen 
werden können, ohne dass dies negative Kon-
sequenzen für die betroffene Person hat. Die be-
troffene Person sollte verlangen können, dass ihre 
personenbezogenen Daten gelöscht und nicht wei-
ter verarbeitet werden. Grundsätzlich sollten alle 
Daten nach ihrer Analyse gelöscht werden, wenn 
eine weitere Vorhaltung nicht gerechtfertigt ist. Die 
Bedingungen, unter denen eine Rücknahme der 
Einwilligung nicht möglich ist, sollten in den Ver-
fahrensbestimmungen über die „informierte Ein-
willigung“ detailliert dargelegt werden. Der für die 
Verarbeitung Verantwortliche muss hinreichende 
Gewissheit haben, dass es sich bei dem Einwilligen-
den tatsächlich um die betroffene Person handelt, 
und für IKT, die eine Verarbeitung von Daten der 
betroffenen Person erforderlich machen, müssen 
Instrumente für den Nachweis der Einwilligung zur 
Datennutzung (wie die digitale oder elektronische 
Unterschrift) verfügbar sein. 

•	 Kinder und hilfebedürftige Erwachsene benö-
tigen einen besonderen Schutz ihrer personenbe-
zogenen Daten, weil ihnen die Risiken, Folgen und 
Sicherheitsgarantien im Zusammenhang mit der 
Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten so-
wie ihre diesbezüglichen Rechte möglicherweise 
weniger bekannt sind.

•	 Damit die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Da-
ten rechtmäßig ist, sollten personenbezogene

Recht auf Vergessen zugrunde liegende Idee und

empfiehlt für den Onlinebereich, das Recht auf Lö-
schung personenbezogener Daten dahingehend 
auszuweiten, dass sämtliche öffentlich verfügbaren 
Originale und Kopien gelöscht werden müssen.

•	 Die EGE empfiehlt, auch die Verarbeitung perso-
nenbezogener Daten von in der EU ansässigen 
betroffenen Personen durch einen nicht in der EU 
bzw. im EWR niedergelassenen für die Verarbeitung 
Verantwortlichen durch den normativen Rahmen 
der EU für den Datenschutzbereich zu regeln.

5.5 

 Soziale Aspekte: die digitale Kluft

5.5.1  Die digitale Kluft

Ein zentraler Faktor, den es bei allen Überlegungen 
über die Förderung der Nutzung von IKT in unter-
schiedlichen gesellschaftlichen Bereichen - von der 
elektronischen Verwaltung bis zu elektronischen Ge-
sundheitsdiensten und vom elektronischen Geschäfts-
verkehr bis zu elektronischen Dienstleistungen - zu 
berücksichtigen gilt, ist die Umsetzung des Gerechtig-
keitsprinzips und des Nichtdiskriminierungsgrundsat-
zes. Ethisch betrachtet wird eine solche Nutzung von 
IKT immer dann heikel, wenn sie vollständig an die 
Stelle herkömmlicher Dienstleistungen tritt und sich 
so auf die Gemeinschaft aller EU-Bürger auswirkt. In-
novative Formen des Handels, der Verwaltung und der 
Gesundheitsversorgung können in der Tat eine bessere 
Qualität und nachhaltigere Dienste für den Bürger mit 
sich bringen. Dieses Ziel ist zweifelsohne beizubehal-
ten und zu fördern, aber wer diese Politik propagiert, 
sollte stets im Hinterkopf behalten, dass sie möglicher-
weise den Grundsatz der partizipatorischen Gerechtig-
keit berührt und sich auch auf den Dienstleistungszu-
gang von Einzelnen und Gruppen auswirken kann, die 
keinen Zugang zu Dienstleistungen haben oder von 
diesen keinen Gebrauch machen können oder wollen. 

Die Gesellschaft unterliegt einem raschen, kontinuierli-
chen und ständigen Wandel.  Der innere Drang, nahezu 
fortwährend Neues zu erfinden bzw. wiederzuerfinden 
und Altes abzulegen, ist ein nur dem Menschen eige-
ner Wesenszug, der auf dessen Streben nach Fortschritt 
und Wohlstand für die Menschheit beruht. Die heuti-
ge Gesellschaft wird von Technik beherrscht, und die 
meisten Menschen sind davon überzeugt, dass die im-
mer neuen technologischen Entwicklungen ihr Leben 
und ihre Beziehungen zueinander verändert haben 
oder verändern können. Es gibt aber auch Menschen, 
die aus einer Vielzahl von Gründen nicht am digitalen 
Leben teilnehmen möchten, und diese Entscheidung, 

die ja Ausdruck ihrer persönlichen Eigenständigkeit 
ist, muss respektiert werden. Da sie die IKT nicht in ihr 
tägliches Leben einfließen lassen, besteht gleichwohl 
die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ihre Wahlmöglichkeiten im 
digitalen Zeitalter zunehmend geringer werden. Nur 
weil sie sich dafür entschieden haben, den digitalen 
Technologien die kalte Schulter zu zeigen, sollten der-
artige „digitale Hinterwäldler“ aber unabhängig davon 
nicht vom Zugang zu wesentlichen Diensten ausge-
schlossen werden, und ihnen darf auch nicht die Mög-
lichkeit genommen werden, ihren gesellschaftlichen 
Pflichten (Teilnahme an Wahlen, Entrichten von Steu-
ern usw.) nachzukommen. Im Interesse von Integration 
und Solidarität ist es mithin die Aufgabe der breiten 
Gesellschaft, sich dafür einzusetzen, dass zumindest 
kurz- und mittelfristig alternative Möglichkeiten zur 
Erfüllung dieser Pflichten geschaffen werden.   

Damit das Recht der Bürger auf eine aktive Rolle in der 
europäischen Gesellschaft gewahrt bleibt und ihre 
Entscheidung bezüglich der von ihnen dafür ausge-
wählten Mittel respektiert wird, unterbreitet die EGE 
folgende Empfehlungen:

•	 Die EGE erkennt an, dass es anderer Konzepte, In-
halte und Anwendungen bedarf, um den beson-
deren Anforderungen von benachteiligten und 
marginalisierten Gruppen gerecht zu werden. Zu 
diesem Zweck empfiehlt die EGE der EU, zu prüfen, 
inwieweit mit Maßnahmen zur direkten Bereitstel-
lung der betreffenden Dienste, mit Finanzhilfe-
maßnahmen und mit Regulierungsmaßnahmen 
sichergestellt werden kann, dass diese Gruppen 
nicht von einer umfassenden und aktiven Rolle in 
der digitalen Gesellschaft ausgeschlossen werden.

•	 Die EGE begrüßt die Anstrengungen der Kommissi-
on zur Beseitigung der digitalen Kluft und insbe-
sondere die Zusammenarbeit mit internationalen 
Partnern, und sie empfiehlt der EU die Annahme 
von Strategien, die über die Bereitstellung eines öf-
fentlichen Zugangs hinausgehen und Maßnahmen 
einschließen, welche darauf abstellen, dass von 
diesem Zugang auch effektiv Gebrauch gemacht 
werden kann. Dabei sollte es unter anderem darum 
gehen, Menschen die nötigen Fähigkeiten und die 
nötige Motivation zu vermitteln, damit diese das 
Potenzial von IKT im Rahmen von Bildungs- und 
Mentoringprogrammen, bei denen sie in einen 
sinnvollen und für sie nützlichen Lernprozess ein-
gebunden werden, ausschöpfen können.

•	 Die EGE empfiehlt, dass in Bereichen, in denen die 
Bürger bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Verpflich-
tungen unterliegen oder in denen der Zugang zu 
wesentlichen Diensten ohne Rückgriff auf IKT nicht 
möglich ist, kurz- oder mittelfristig IKT-unabhängi-
ge Verfahren eingeführt werden. 

5.5.2 

 Vereinbarkeit von Berufs- und Privatleben

Die EGE ist sich bewusst, welche Möglichkeiten eine 
stärkere Vernetzung im Berufsleben bietet, möchte 
aber auf die Risiken hinweisen, die die Kultur der stän-
digen Erreichbarkeit im Berufsleben mit sich bringt, so 
dass sich hinter dem Begriff „flexible Arbeitszeiten“ in 
Wirklichkeit die „Flexibilität“ verbirgt, dass atypisch und 
länger gearbeitet wird, was sich negativ auf das Famili-
enleben auswirken kann. Daher sollten Arbeitnehmer 
wie Arbeitgeber die Nutzung von IKT in diesem Bereich 
überwachen und wirksam steuern. 

•	 Die EGE drängt die EU, Organisationen dazu anzure-
gen und dabei zu unterstützen, explizite Strategien 
für eine optimale Nutzung von IKT zu entwickeln, 
bei der die Vereinbarkeit von Berufs- und Privat-
leben gewährleistet bleibt. Ziel derartiger Strategi-
en sollte die Förderung einer Unternehmenskultur 
sein, bei der nicht erwartet wird, dass die Beschäf-
tigten in ihrer Freizeit „auf Abruf“ bereitstehen. 
Dieser Aspekt sollte auch in die Programme zum 
Thema soziale Verantwortung von Unternehmen 
und in die Arbeitsordnungen einfließen.

5.6  Politische Mitbestimmung

Der Einfluss, den die IKT auf die Politikgestaltung haben 
können, gibt, was das Recht des Bürgers auf freie Infor-
mation, die Fähigkeit von Interessengruppen zur Wahr-
nehmungsveränderung und die Möglichkeiten des 
Staates zur Internetzensur angeht, Anlass zu Beden-
ken. Angesichts des großen, im ersten Teil dieser Stel-
lungnahme beschriebenen Einflusses von IKT auf die 
moderne Gesellschaft setzen die Regierungen in der 
ganzen Welt neue Mittel ein, um mit der Onlinewelt zu 
interagieren: Filter und Sperren, Registrierungspflicht, 
Überwachungsbefugnisse, Haftung von Intermediären 
usw. Die Struktur der zur Wissensvermittlung und zur 
Kommunikation eingesetzten Instrumente wirft bei all 
ihren Verwendungsformen Fragen bezüglich der Len-
kung von Wissen und Informationen zum Zwecke der 
Realitäts- und Meinungsbildung im digitalen Zeitalter 
auf, darunter das Risiko einer möglichen Online-Ver-
breitung von verzerrt dargestellten Informationen zu 

politischen Zwecken. Diesbezüglich empfiehlt die EGE 
folgende Maßnahmen:

•	 Die EGE erkennt an, dass die Grundeigenschaft 
des  Internets  die  freie  und  aktive  Mitwirkung 
seiner Nutzer ist. Sie betont die Notwendigkeit, 
die Freiheit und die Neutralität des Internets 
zu wahren. Gleichwohl darf diese Freiheit nicht 
den  grundlegenden  ethischen  Werten  der  EU 
zuwiderlaufen.

•	 Das Internet muss ein Kommunikationsbereich 
bleiben, in dem die Meinungsfreiheit nach Maß-
gabe der Charta der Grundrechte gegen Zensur 
geschützt wird.

•	 Die EGE sieht die Notwendigkeit eines ausgewo-
genen  Verhältnisses  zwischen  einer  von  oben 
nach unten erfolgenden Steuerung des Internet 
durch Regierungsstellen und den von unten nach 
oben  gerichteten  partizipatorischen  Ansätzen 
der Internetgemeinschaft. Sie betont daher, dass 
die EU, die Mitgliedstaaten und sonstige wichtige 
Akteure bei ihren gemeinsamen Beratungen ein 
transparentes Mitbestimmungskonzept in den 
Entscheidungsfindungsprozess einbeziehen 
sollten. Dies gilt für  alle Regulierungsmaßnahmen 
im IKT-Bereich. 

5.7  Empfehlungen für den Handelsbereich

5.7.1  Handelsgeschäfte

Die EGE unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit, die Rechte 
und die Interessen der EU-Bürger zu wahren. Sie be-
grüßt daher die von der Europäischen Kommission vor-
geschlagene Strategie für die soziale Verantwortung 
der Unternehmen, welche vorsieht, dass die Unterneh-
men, um ihrer Verantwortung nachkommen zu kön-
nen, auf ein Verfahren zurückgreifen können sollen, mit 
dem soziale, ökologische, ethische, Menschenrechts- 
und Verbraucherbelange in enger Zusammenarbeit 
mit den „Stakeholdern“ in die Betriebsführung und in 
ihre Kernstrategie integriert werden (KOM(2011) 681 
endg.). Die EGE begrüßt zudem die von der EU und 
von internationalen Gremien ergriffenen Maßnahmen 
zur Wahrung der Netzneutralität (siehe beispielsweise 
KOM(2011) 222 endg.), weist jedoch auf die Notwen-
digkeit der in dieser Stellungnahme vorgeschlagenen 
Maßnahmen zum Thema Verantwortung (des Einzel-
nen, von Unternehmen, der Gesellschaft und der Re-
gierungen) hin. Daher sollte die Schaffung von geeig-
neten Instrumenten (und deren Umsetzung) gefördert

werden, mit denen sich diese Ziele verwirklichen lassen 
– und zwar angefangen bei der sozialen Verantwor-
tung der Unternehmen (KOM(2011) 681 endg.) bis hin 
zu einem einschlägigen Verhaltenskodex (Maßnahmen 
der Kommission für eine verantwortungsvolle Nutzung 
des „Cloud computing“, „Internet der Dinge“, Empfeh-
lung für verantwortungsvolle Innovationen - 2012 
usw.). Zu diesem Zweck empfiehlt die EGE folgende 
Maßnahmen:

•	 Die EGE erkennt an, dass es ein ausgewogenes 
Verhältnis  zwischen  der  Nutzung  von  IKT 
zu  kommerziellen  Zwecken  und  ihrer  Ver-
wendung zu nicht kommerziellen Zwecken 
zu schaffen gilt. Sie empfiehlt der Europäischen 
Kommission, 1.) ihre Datenschutzvorschriften zur 
Anwendung zu bringen und dafür Sorge zu tra-
gen, dass soziale Netzwerke verantwortungsvoll 
mit den ihnen von ihren Nutzern mitgeteilten Da-
ten umgehen; 2.) die Nutzer darüber aufzuklären, 
dass es sich bei sozialen Netzwerken zumeist um 
gewerbliche Unternehmen handelt, die die Daten 
für kommerzielle Zwecke verwenden müssen, um 
die von ihnen angebotenen Dienste erbringen zu 
können; 3.) alle verfügbaren Mittel für die Schaf-
fung eines (voraussichtlich auf den bestehenden 
Netzen aufbauenden) Raums der sozialen Netze 
bereitzustellen, in dem es keine gewerbliche Nut-
zung gibt und der allen Nutzern offensteht (wenn-
gleich sie unter Umständen für dieses Vorrecht 
bezahlen müssen).

•	 Die EGE ist der Auffassung, dass Menschen, die ei-
nen Handelsvertrag abschließen möchten, in ein-
deutiger, präziser und verständlicher Weise über 
die Bestimmungen und Bedingungen eines solchen 
Vertrags aufgeklärt werden sollten.

5.7.2 

 Soziale Verantwortung der Unternehmen

Für den Schutz der Privatsphäre sind insbesondere 
die Grundsätze der im Oktober 2011 von der Euro-
päischen Kommission angenommenen Strategie für 
die soziale Verantwortung der Unternehmen maß-
geblich. Die Strategie zeigt auf, wie Unternehmen 
sich ihre soziale Verantwortung zunutze machen 
und gleichzeitig einen Beitrag zur Gesellschaft ins-
gesamt leisten können, in dem sie sich nach Kräf-
ten bemühen, ihren sozialen Verantwortlichkeiten 
nachzukommen.  

•	 Die EGE begrüßt diese Initiative und empfiehlt der 
EU, die Unternehmen dazu zu ermutigen, bei der 

Umsetzung ihrer Politik für ihre soziale Verantwor-
tung auch dem Schutz der Privatsphäre Rechnung 
zu tragen und dabei auch auf technologische Lö-
sungen wie Datenschutz-Folgenabschätzungen, 
Technologien für einen besseren Schutz der Pri-
vatsphäre und einen „eingebauten Datenschutz“ 
zu setzen.

5.8 

 Kreuzkorrelative Datenerschließung

Die kreuzkorrelative Datenerschließung kann eine 
wichtige Rolle spielen, wenn aus einer Vielzahl von 
Quellen zusammengestellte Datenbanken gemeinsam 
analysiert werden, um Informationen zu erschließen, 
die in den einzelnen Datenbanken als solche nicht 
enthalten sind. So liefert beispielsweise die Verknüp-
fung von über Kundenkarten zusammengetragenen 
Einkaufsdaten mit Bankdaten und/oder mit Gesund-
heitsdaten Aufschlüsse über die Gewohnheiten eines 
Menschen, die ansonsten vielleicht nicht auf Anhieb 
erkennbar gewesen wären.  Eine derartige Datenver-
knüpfung erfolgt oftmals unter Verwendung von Da-
ten von Bürgern, die einer solchen Verwendung nicht 
ausdrücklich zugestimmt haben, und diese kann die 
Erstellung des Profils von nicht aufgeklärten und sich 
dieser Möglichkeit gar nicht bewussten Personen er-
möglichen, wobei das Risiko einer Stigmatisierung die-
ser Personen und einer Verletzung ihrer Privatsphäre 
bestehen kann. Daher empfiehlt die EGE folgende 
Maßnahmen:

•	 Einzelpersonen  sollten  von  Unternehmen, 
staatlichen Stellen und Forschungsgremien aus-
drücklich darüber informiert werden, dass ihre 
Daten zu bestimmten Zwecken einer Datener-
schießung unterzogen werden können. Auf die-
se Weise wäre sichergestellt, dass jeder Einzelne 
eine „informierte“ Entscheidung darüber treffen 
kann, auf welche Dienste er zurückgreift. Immer 
wenn Datenbanken zueinander in Beziehung ge-
setzt werden sollen, sollte zuvor die ausdrückliche 
Einwilligung der betroffenen Personen eingeholt 
werden. Daher sollten weitere Forschungsarbei-
ten über die Auswirkungen der kreuzkorrela-
tiven Datenerschließung auf die Privatsphä-
re durchgeführt werden, damit die potenziellen 
Vorteile dieses Verfahrens der Gesellschaft zum 
Nutzen gereichen können, gleichzeitig aber die 
Menschenrechte gewahrt bleiben. Zudem emp-
fiehlt die EGE der EU, näher zu prüfen, ob bzw. 
unter welchen Bedingungen sensible Daten – u.a. 
für die kreuzkorrelative Datenerschließung – ver-
wendet werden können.

•	 Die EGE empfiehlt der EU, die Unsicherheiten, die 
wegen der Rohstoffknappheit in Bezug auf das der-
zeitige IKT-System bestehen, näher zu analysieren.

•	 Der Gruppe ist bekannt, dass bereits in mehreren 
Berichten bemängelt wurde, dass bestimmte Mine-
ralien, die von wesentlicher Bedeutung für die Her-
stellung von IKT-Hardware sind, unter menschen-
unwürdigen Bedingungen gefördert werden. Die 
Gruppe fordert die EU daher auf, sich für bessere 
Arbeitsbedingungen der in diesem Sektor tätigen 
Personen einzusetzen, so dass die Menschenrechte 
gewahrt werden. Diese Anforderung sollte auch in 
die von der EU finanzierten Entwicklungsprogram-
me aufgenommen werden.

5.10  Abschließende Empfehlung

Die EGE erkannt das Potenzial der Digitalen Agenda für 
Europa an und unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit einer 
verantwortungsvollen, integrativen und sozial nachhal-
tigen Umsetzung dieser wichtigen Politik. Die Gruppe 
empfiehlt daher, die Maßnahmen der Digitalen Agenda 
für Europa in Übereinstimmung mit den Grundwerten 
der Europäischen Union zu fördern. Zudem betont sie 
die Notwendigkeit, im Rahmen der IKT-Programme von 
„Horizont 2020“  Bildungs- und Forschungsmaßnah-
men in den Bereichen Ethik, Recht, Gesellschaft und 
Umwelt zu finanzieren.

5.9  Umwelt und Rohstoffe

Das Verhältnis zwischen den IKT und der Umwelt ist 
überaus komplex, denn die IKT können sich sowohl 
positiv als auch negativ auf die Umwelt auswirken. 
So können die IKT äußerst positive Auswirkungen auf 
die Umwelt haben, wenn sie als Mittel zum Schutz der 
Umwelt genutzt werden, sei es zur Überwachung von 
Umweltaspekten, zur Steuerung von Systemen zum 
Schutz der städtischen Umwelt, zur Weitervermitt-
lung von Umweltkenntnissen, zur Verbreitung von 
Informationen an die Öffentlichkeit, zur Förderung ei-
ner aktiven Bürgerbeteiligung, zur Vereinfachung einer 
effizienten Ressourcenverwendung, zur Minderung des 
Verbrauchs von Energie und wichtigen natürlichen Res-
sourcen (Beispiel: Reduzierung des Papierverbrauchs 
durch elektronische und papierlose Kommunikation) 
oder  für eine bessere Nutzung natürlicher Ressourcen. 
Als Beispiel für eine solche Transformation ist insbeson-
dere die Nutzung von IKT zur Verbesserung landwirt-
schaftlicher Praktiken, zur Überwachung der Luft- und 
der Wasserverschmutzung, zur Katastrophenvorhersa-
ge sowie zur Effizienzverbesserung in den Bereichen 
Energie, Verkehr, Güter und Dienstleistungen zu nen-
nen. Auch kann der Rückgriff auf elektronische Kom-
munikationsmittel wie E-Mail oder Videokonferenzen 
zu einem geringeren Verkehrsaufkommen beitragen.

Gleichzeitig gilt es an der Nachhaltigkeit dieser Tech-
nologien zu arbeiten, um nicht eingeplante Folgen wie 
einen höheren Energieverbrauch, die Entsorgung ge-
brauchter Elektronikgeräte oder die Verschwendung 
von Rohstoffen wie seltenen Erden zu vermeiden. 
Zahlreiche Elektronikgeräte erfordern in der Herstel-
lung einen extensiven Rückgriff auf seltene chemische 
Elemente wie Tantal, Lanthan oder Dysprosium, und 
moderne Batterien und Akkus bestehen großenteils 
aus Lithium. In den Ländern, die Mineralien, welche 
diese Elemente enthalten, fördern, führt die Nachfra-
ge nach diesen Metallen zu sozialen und ökologischen 
Problemen. Außerdem werden bestimmte Elemente 
überhaupt nur in einigen wenigen Ländern gefördert. 
Wer IKT nutzen möchte, ist mithin auf Energie und auf 
bestimmte Rohstoffe angewiesen, und den damit ver-
bundenen Unsicherheiten gilt es Rechnung zu tragen.

•	 Die EGE empfiehlt, die Auswirkungen von IKT auf 
die Umwelt (Energieverbrauch, Abfallproduktion 
und Rohstoffeinsatz) zu quantifizieren, anzuerken-
nen, zu analysieren und zu kommunizieren und die 
Ausbeutung natürlicher Ressourcen auf ein Mini-
mum zu beschränken.

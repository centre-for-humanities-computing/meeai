Democracy  is  not  merely  a  formal 
regime  consisting  of  periodic  free 
elections. It is committed to protecting 
and  promoting  fundamental  rights 
and  values,  as  well  as  practices  of 
lived democracy. Our democratic ethos, 
situated  in  relations  of  reciprocity  and 
solidarity  among  citizens,  needs  to  be 
nurtured,  through  dialogue  between 
politicians and citizens, and by strong and 
meaningful participation of citizens in 
civic and political life.

Authoritarian populism is incompatible 
with this conception of democracy. It 
is characterised by antagonism against 
civil  society  organisations,  media,  and 
other entities that stand up for the rule 
of law and the interests of the people and 
minorities.

SO WHAT IS  
NEEDED NOW?

 ‣ We need an understanding of identity 
which  is  not  defined  by  exclusio-
nary  categories  such  as  territory, 
nation, ethnicity or religion – but which 
transcends these, appreciates plurality, 
and creates a sense of (transnational, 
European)  belonging  by  building  on 
values and their translation into civic 
practices.
This could help to strengthen people’s 
participation  in  society  and  their 
appreciation  of  the  European 
endeavour.

 ‣ We need a reorientation of Europe to 
its  social  roots  –  understood  as  a 
commitment  to  providing  a  dignified 
life for everyone, avoiding grave levels 
of social and economic inequality.
This would also help to provide protec-
tion  against  the  rise  of  far-right 
authoritarianism.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Renewing  our  understanding  of 
democracy  and  making  substantive 
participatory democracy real, which 
involves ongoing public consultation and 
deliberation.

Strong  and  sufficiently  funded  public 
infrastructures  (for  housing,  health, 
education etc.) as a precondition for civic 
and political engagement.

Support for European public spaces, 
such as (non-commercial) deliberative 
platforms, including digital social spaces, 
that  encourage  citizen  involvement  in 
European decision-making.

Active encouragement of intermediary 
structures, 
including  associative 
democracy  –  the  self-organisation  of 
citizens in grass-roots associations that 
identify and solve problems at local and 
regional levels.

a 

of 

Encouragement 
strong 
administrative  and  civic  ethos  in 
public  administration  that  works  with 
civic associations; indeed a transformed 
interplay  between  citizens  and  the 
existing institutions of decision-making 
– on the basis of a pluralistic Europe as 
a community of values.

Analysing  how  law,  including  legal 
processes, are at risk of being hollowed 
out  and  repurposed  by  authoritarian 
populist leaders – and resisting this.

Reinforcing  mechanisms  that  secure 
and  support  fact  and  value-based 
collective  memory  of  our  European 
history; recognising the contribution of 
the research community to strengthen 
democracy;  measuring  the  wellbeing 
of societies in a more comprehensive 
sense.

Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice

INTRODUCTORY NOTE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

With its priority A new push for European democracy, the European Commission has 
endeavoured  to  steward  a  reinforcement  of  democracy.  Essential  elements  of  this 
have  been  the  European  Democracy  Action  Plan,  the  Defence  of  Democracy 
package, and the Conference on the Future of Europe. In this context, and against 
the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President von der Leyen requested 
the  EGE  to  develop  an  Opinion and  recommendations  on   Democracy  in  the  digital 
age, which the EGE issued in June 2023.  

Vice-President  Dubravka  Šuica,  having  gratefully  received  the  EGE’s  advice on 
behalf  of  the  College, invit ed  the  EGE  to  reflect  further o n  the  recent rise  of 
authoritarian populism in some Member States and around the world, and to provide 
the  Commission with  advice  o n  the  threats  that  this pose s to  democracy.  This 
second  request  was  formulated  in  the  context  of  the  upcoming  elections of  the 
European Parliament and the many other elections taking place in 2024. 

Noting that the EGE’s call for profound action in the first Opinion spoke deeply to the 
Commission’s  concern  about  the  health  of  democracy,  the  Vice-President  stressed 
the  need  to  discuss what  is  ne cessary for  a  vivid  European  civic  space , built  on 
common values and respect of fundamental rights, to provide strong possibilities for 
civic  participation.  She  also  asked  the  EGE  to  analyse  what  role  processes  around 
the formation of identities, indeed – of a European identity, play in this.  

The  Statement  at  hand  aims  to  provide  insights  on  these  questions.  It  begins by 
tracing the  differences  between  formal  and  substantive  understandings  of 
democracy  and  shows  how  authoritarianism  is  incompatible  with,  and  can b est be 
countered via, the latter. In this context, it also analyses a series of conditions that 
may  support  far-right p opulism and  makes  the  case  for  participatory  democracy, 
zooming in on how ‘associative democracy’ can give voice, agency, and power to the 
people. It then discusses essentialist, exclusivist versus living, entangled, pluralistic 
understandings  of  identity,  with  the  latter  representing  the  values  of  the  European 
project. The Statement concludes with a set of recommendations for policy makers 
and for all of us.  

The  EGE’s  work  on  democracy  is  rooted  in  its  Statement  on  Values  for  the  Future 
(June  2021),  issued  in  the  context  of  the  Conference  on  the  Future  of  Europe,  in 
which  the group  throws  light  on  the  connections  between  ethics  and  fundamental 
rights, democracy and the rule of law, concluding with a recommendation for the EU 
to maximise opportunities for public participation in policy making. It further builds 
on  the  EGE’s  work  in  the  context  of  COVID-19  on  the  role  of  Values  in  times  of 
crisis, which points to the importance of human dignity and solidarity guiding crisis 
management, and of processes of deliberation that make values explicit. 

All  of  the  people  who  contributed  to  the  development  of  this  Statement,  be  it  in 
discussions  or  in  writing,  are  appreciatively  recognised  –  notably:  Toma  Sutic,

Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

1. DEMOCRACY AND POPULISM 

Democracy  is  under  threat  around  the  world.  A  much  greater  share  of  the  world’s 
population lives in autocracies today than in democracies. In the last decade, their 
proportion  has  increased  from  48  to  71  per  cent  (Nord  et  al.  2024).  At  the  same 
time, the quality of democracy has been declining in many parts of the world, with 
freedom of expression being the worst affected component (ibid.). In the European 
Union specifically, although most citizens believe that democracy is the best system 
of  collective  governance,  the  functioning  of  representative  democracy  faces 
increasing criticism and disengagement (Ingelgom 2023).  

Why  is  this  the  case?  In  the  literature,  various  developments  are  seen  as 
responsible  for  this,  including  global  crises,  political  polarisation,  and  austerity 
(Georgiadou  2013;  Solty  2013;  Baier  2016;  Salmela  &  Von  Scheve  2017; 
Eichengreen 2018; Rama & Cordero 2018; Bugaric 2019; Beckfield 2019; Baccini & 
Sattler  2023).  Another  development  that  endangers  democracies  worldwide  is  the 
alarming  rise of  populism.  For  many  scholars  (Popp-Madsen  2020;  Bauer &  Becker 
2020) populism poses one of the biggest current threats to liberal democracies and 
is  the  main  cause  of  democratic  backsliding.  Populism  has  been  characterised  as  a 
‘thin’  ideology  (Mudde &  Kaltwasser  2012;  Mudde &  Kaltwasser  2017),  referring  to 
charismatic  politicians  who  seek  power  by  getting  the  support  of  large  parts  of 
unaffiliated voters without presenting a clear vision on what they believe constitutes 
a  just  society  or  human  flourishing.  What  is  relatively  new  in  recent  populist 
movements is the pitting of large numbers of potential followers not only against an 
elite that is held responsible for the soaring inequities of the last decades, but also 
against groups who are even worse off than the groups that are mobilised. Fear and 
dissatisfaction are directed at immigrants or cultural, religious, minoritised ethnic or 
other  groups,  who  are  portrayed  as  the  source  of  societal  problems.  The  use  of 
social  media  plays  a  key  role  in  these  strategies,  seen  at  work  in  the  UK  (during 
Brexit)  and  in  Trump’s  campaigns  in  the  United  States,  the  main  argument  being: 
“The  government  has  become  an  instrument  for  redistributing  your  money  to  the 
undeserving”  (Hochschild  quoted  by  Weithman  2020)  This  is  bad  news  for 
democracy  which  is  premised  on  civic  reciprocity,  civic  friendship,  and  basic 
solidarity  among  citizens.  Moreover,  opportunities  to  effectively  address  the  root 
causes of soaring inequality are lost in rhetoric. 

The EGE has previously proposed that Europe embrace a pluralistic and substantive 
conception  of  democracy  (EGE,  Opinion  on  Democracy  in  the  Digital  Age,  2023). 
Such  a  ‘thick’  conception  of  democracy  goes  beyond  a  set  of  formal  democratic 
mechanisms such as voting, fair elections and aggregation of individual preferences. 
Building  on  our  previous  work  on  this  topic,  in  this  Statement  we  provide  a  more 
elaborate  view  on  what  it  takes  to  protect  a  strong  democratic  culture  and 
reinvigorate our European democratic societies. The ‘thick’ notion of democracy that 
we  propose  requires  a  free,  respectful,  and  pluralistic  civic  space,  understood  as 
“the  environment  that  enables  people  and  groups  –  or  ‘civic  space  actors’  –  to 
participate  meaningfully  in  the  political,  economic,  social  and  cultural  life  in  their 
societies” (UN Guidance Note: Protection and Promotion of Civic Space, 2020, p. 3). 
The UN further notes that a  “vibrant civic space requires an open, secure and safe 
environment  that  is  free  from  all  acts  of  intimidation,  harassment  and  reprisals, 
whether  online  or  offline.  Any  restrictions  on  such  a  space  must  comply  with 
international human rights law” (ibid.).

Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

In this Statement, we will make the argument that authoritarian forms of populism, 
in which the rule of law and democratic institutions more broadly are denounced as 
representing the interests of ‘the elites’, are incompatible with the thick conception 
of democracy we have espoused. We will discuss some of the causes for the growth 
of authoritarian populism, in particular recent experiences of austerity and the (real 
and  perceived)  gap  between  citizens  and  processes  of  public  decision-making;  and 
explore  means  by  which  they  may  be  addressed.  Making  the  case  for  a  ‘thick’ 
understanding  of  European  identity,  we  will  end  with  recommendations  for  the 
strengthening  of  a  pluralistic  European  civic  space,  of  a  shared  understanding  of  a 
European  identity  on  the  basis  of  fundamental  rights  and  values,  and  their 
importance in creating and sustaining a robust democracy. 

1.1.  Two dimensions of democracy 

There are various ways to classify democracies (see e.g. Dahl 1971; Lijphart 1999; 
Przeworski & Limongi 1993). We will focus here on two dimensions that are key in 
the  context  of  responding  to  populism.  The  first  is  the  distinction  between  formal 
and  substantive  conceptions  of  democracy1  Formal  conceptions  focus  on  the 
externally  visible  characteristics  of  democracies,  such  as  the  holding  of  free 
elections,  or  the  existence  of  institutions  that  embody  the  separation  of  powers, 
whereas  substantive  understandings  of  democracy  emphasise  fundamental  rights 
and  values  that  underpin  democratic  institutions  and  processes,  such  as  dignity, 
freedom,  equality,  solidarity,  and  social  justice.  The  second  dimension  that  is 
relevant  in  the  context  of  populism  relates to  the  distinction  between  monistic  and 
pluralistic democracies. Monistic understandings of democracy seek to establish and 
implement  the  supposed  will  of  ‘the  people’,  where  ‘the  people’  are  seen  as  a 
monolithic  entity.  By  contrast,  pluralistic  conceptions  of  democracy  emphasise  the 
pluralism  and  diversity  which  make  up  the  people  –  the  ‘demos’  –  and  view  the 
interplay and deliberation of a broad range of voices and perspectives as a good to 
be  protected.  As  noted,  in  our  previous  Opinion  on  Democracy  in  the  Digital  Age 
(EGE,  2023)  we  espoused  a  ‘thick’  conception  of  democracy  that  views  democracy 
not  merely  as  a  political  regime  but  also  “as  a  set  of  values  that  shape  human 
behaviour  and  form  the  foundation  of  society”  (ibid.,  p.  5).  Such  a  ‘thick’ 
understanding  of  democracy  corresponds  with  substantive  and  pluralistic 
conceptions (see Table 1).

Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

The essence of 
democracy is: 

‘Thin’ democracy: 

Formal institutions 

Ideal role of 
citizens’ voices: 

Monistic (looking for 
the one, ‘true’ will of 
‘the people’) 

Compatible 
with populism? 

Yes, with most 

forms of 
populism 

‘Thick’ democracy: 

Substantive values, 
rights, and practices, as 
well as the institutions 
that articulate and 
protect them 

Pluralistic 
(accommodating a 
diversity of views and 
lifestyles) 

Not with 
authoritarian 
populism (see 
below) 

Table 1: Different definitions of democracy. Highlighted in grey is the ‘thick’ understanding of 
democracy that we have promoted in our previous Opinion (EGE, Opinion on Democracy in the 
Digital Age, 2023). 

1.2.  Populism: A threat for democracies?  

Not  all  political  action  that  responds  to  public  protests  or  grievances  is  necessarily 
populist.  According  to  a  widely  accepted  definition,  populism  is  a  ‘thin’  ideology 
revolving around the pitting of ‘the people’ against ‘the elites’ (Mudde & Kaltwasser 
2012;  Mudde  &  Kaltwasser  2017),  often  privileging  the  alleged  ‘will  of  the  people’ 
above  everything  else  (see  also  Bugaric  2019;  Mansbridge  &  Macedo  2019).  The 
thin  definition  of  populism  does  not  imply,  however,  that  all  existing  forms  of 
populism are ideologically neutral. In practice, they are not. ‘Thin’ populist dynamics 
attach  themselves  to  other,  substantive,  ideologies.  In  the  words  of  democratic 
theorist Bojan Bugaric (2019, p. 50), “populism should not be considered in isolation 
from its host ideology”. If populism attaches itself to egalitarian, social justice driven 
programmes  that  support  pluralism  against  an  economic  elite,  or  a  gentry,  such 
‘emancipatory populism’ (Canovan 1999, Dix 1985, Rodrik 2018a, b, Bugaric 2019, 
Norris & Inglehart 2019, Rodrik 2021) can, scholars argue, have positive effects on 
democracies.  

Much  more  frequent,  however,  are  authoritarian  forms  of  populism,  which  are  also 
anti-pluralist (see also Müller 2017). An important difference between emancipatory 
and authoritarian populism can be drawn along the lines of who they include in the 
notions of ‘the people’ and ‘the elites’: While emancipatory populism tends to define 
‘the  people’  according  to  their  economic  power  (e.g.  people  in  paid  and  precarious 
employment,  or  everyone  without  significant  wealth),  authoritarian  populism 
typically  uses  ethnic  or  other  nativist  labels  (see  also  Rosanvallon  2008,  p.  266).  
Similarly,  while  emancipatory  populism  tends  to  mobilise  against  elites  that  are 
defined  in  economic  terms  (business  owners,  ‘capitalists’),  authoritarian  populism 
mobilises  indiscriminately  against  big  business  alongside  democratically  elected 
political  leaders  and  representatives  of  independent  media.  In  fact,  authoritarian 
populism 
is  characterised  by  pronounced  antagonism  against  civil  society 
organisations, media, and other entities that represent and stand up for the rule of 
law.  In  extreme  forms  of  authoritarian  and  (other)  far-right  populism,  the  rule  of 
law  and  democratic  institutions  more  broadly  are  denounced  as  representing  the 
interests of ‘the elites’. In this manner, in an ironic and perverted turn, democracy 
itself  is  portrayed  as  the  enemy  of  ‘the  people’.  The  so-called  Korneuburg  Oath  of 

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 7 

 
 
 
 
Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

Austrofascism  (1930)  is  an  illustration  of  how  authoritarian  populism  justifies  the 
usurpation of power by a strong leader on behalf of ‘the people’:  

“We  demand  of  every  comrade:  undaunted  faith  in  the  fatherland, 
untiring zeal in service, and passionate love of his  native land. We are 
determined to take over the state and to remould it and its economy in 
the 
interests  of  the  whole  Volk.  [...]  We  repudiate  western 
parliamentary  democracy  and  the  party  state!  [...]  Let  every  comrade 
realize  and  proclaim  that he  [...]  is  prepared  to  offer  up  his  blood  and 
his possessions, and that he recognises three forces only: Faith in God, 
his  own  unbending  will,  [and]  the  commands  of  his  [leader].” 
(reproduced in the translation of Jedlicka 1966, p. 138-139) 

This quote includes at least two characteristics that, still today, make authoritarian 
populism  dangerous  to  pluralistic  and  substantive  democracies.  First,  authoritarian 
populists  build  and  exploit  a  tension  between  emphasising  people’s  individual  and 
independent  judgement  on  the  one  hand  (calling  on  people  to  assert  their  “own 
unbending will” in contrast, for example, to trusting the narratives of human rights 
advocates and independent journalists) and the “will of the leader” on the other. It 
is assumed, although not spelled out, that if a conflict between people’s judgement 
and  the  will  of  the  leader  arises,  the  former  has  to  concede  to  the  latter.  Second, 
authoritarian  populists  undermine  democratic  institutions  and  principles  in  diverse 
ways. On the one hand, they do this through direct attacks on these institutions and 
principles,  framing  them  as  the  enemy  of  ‘the  people’.  These  attacks  typically 
involve  direct  breaches  of  the  democratic  constitutional  order  and  open,  explicit 
infringement  of  legal-democratic  principles  such  as  the  rule  of  law.  On  the  other 
hand,  authoritarian  populists  manipulate  the  content  and  form  of  liberal  law  for 
illiberal  ends  –  they  (mis)appropriate  it  (De  Búrca  &  Young  2023).  Put  differently, 
authoritarian  populists  subvert  legal-democratic  orders  and  principles  from  within: 
they  ‘bend’  rather  than  ‘breach’  these  orders  and  principles.  They  do  so,  for 
example,  by  complying  with  the  letter  of  the  law  or  its  procedural  norms  while 
violating  its  liberal-democratic  spirit  (Pirro  &  Stanley  2022),  or  by  using  language 
about the protection of human rights in ways designed to undo or reverse existing 
commitments  (De  Búrca  &  Young  2023).  Together,  these  different  forms  of  attack 
involving  the  use,  abuse,  and  non-use  of  law  and  legal  processes  have  been 
described  as  ‘autocratic  legalism’  (Scheppele  2018),  ‘abusive  constitutionalism’ 
(Landau 2013), and ‘constitutional retrogression’ (Huq & Ginsburg 2018). 

1.3.  What authoritarian populism does to democracies 

Overall,  two  scenarios  need  to  be  distinguished  (Mansbridge  &  Macedo  2019): 
Authoritarian  populist  opposition  can  strengthen  democratic  regimes  if  the 
democratic rulers draw the right conclusions from the rise of populist support – for 
example  by  engaging  seriously  with  substantive  concerns  raised.  Authoritarian 
populists  in  government,  however,  have  been  found  to  be  eroding  institutional, 
cultural,  and  legal  constraints  on  the  executive’s  power  to  dismantle  fundamental 
values and rights (Allred, Hawkins & Ruth 2015, Houle & Kenny 2018).

Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

Mapping  different types  of  populism  against  the two  dimensions  of  democracy  that 
we  highlighted  in  Table  1,  we  can  conclude  that  emancipatory  forms  of  populism 
that  do  not  attack  the  institutions  and  spirit  of  democracy,  and  do  not  hollow  out 
respect for fundamental rights and values, can be compatible with democracy. They 
can  even  strengthen  democratic  processes  if  ruling  elites  who  have  been  captured 
by corporate interests, for example, are challenged instead to foreground the needs 
of the wider population. Authoritarian forms of populism, however, are incompatible 
with the ‘thick’ – namely pluralistic and substantive – conception of democracy that 
the  EGE  has  endorsed  in  its  earlier  Opinion  (EGE,  Opinion  on  Democracy  in  the 
Digital  Age,  2023).  A  ‘thick’  understanding  of  democracy,  we  argue,  is  the  only 
version of democracy that can protect itself from the various forces that threaten to 
eradicate  it,  from  outside  and  from  within.  This  is  the  case  because  formal  and 
legitimate 
monistic  understandings  of  democracy  allow 
mechanisms and institutions to act as a vehicle for practices and values that erode 
what  many  people  consider  the  soul  of  liberal  and  pluralistic  democracies:  namely 
fundamental values and rights, and the practices and institutions that articulate and 
protect  them.  In  other  words,  ‘thin’  (formal  and  monistic)  forms  of  democracy  run 
the risk of undermining the conditions for their own existence, whereas ‘thick’ forms 
of  democracy  are  sustained  by  citizens’  commitment  to  fundamental  rights  and 
values that underpin democratic institutions and processes.  

for  democratically 

When protecting and strengthening democracies, we need to attend not only to the 
vertical  relationship  between  citizens  and  the  state,  but  also  to  the  horizontal 
relationship  from  person  to  person.  As  James  Kloppenberg  argued,  democracy  has 
always  been  grafted  upon  a  democratic  ethos  that  is  situated  in  relations  of 
reciprocity  and  solidarity  among  citizens  (Kloppenberg,  2016).  In  this  view  a 
democratic ethos is supported by a particular conception of the moral motivation of 
citizens, which John Rawls referred to as ‘reciprocity’ – where kindness is met with 
kindness.    If  democracy  is  viewed  as  being  only  about  elections  and  formal  rules 
and  mechanics  of  checks  and  balances  on  political  power,  this  essential  underlying 
ethos  tends  to  be  forgotten  (see  also  Waldron,  2016).  How  can  this  ethos  of 
democracy  and  its  associated  virtues  be  regained  and  reinforced?  For  ‘thick’ 
democracies, authoritarian populism is a threat. How can we act against it?

2. FIGHTING THE CAUSES OF AUTHORITARIAN POPULISM  

2.1.  Renewing a commitment to ‘social Europe’ 

Some  studies  find  a  correlation  between  austerity  and  the  rise  of  authoritarian 
populism  (see  also  Rodríguez-Pose,  Terrero-Dávila  &  Lee  2023a,b).  As  Bojan 
Bugaric notes (Bugaric 2019, see also Beckfield 2019, Eichengreen 2018):  

“The  ruling  parties’  obsession  with  fiscal  austerity  and  supply-side 
policies  of  privatization,  deregulation,  and  liberalization  effectively 
triggered a ‘lost decade’ of economic stagnation, rising unemployment, 
increasing  poverty,  and  dwindling  EU  solidarity  that  paved  the  way  for 
the  poisonous  ultranationalism  now  on  the  rise”  (Bugaric  2019,  p.  51-
52). 

Referring to Dani Rodrik (2018b), Bugaric also notes that “the economic anxiety and 
distributional  struggles  exacerbated  by  globalization”  (Bugaric  2019,  p.  43)  create 
the basis for the rise of the kind of populism that is so detrimental to (pluralistic and 
substantive)  democracies.  “What  Europe  needs  more  than  anything”,  Bugaric 
concludes,  “is  a  new  anti-austerity  coalition  focused  on  growth  and  social  justice” 
(ibid., p. 53).  

The link between austerity measures and the rise of authoritarian populism is a topic 
of considerable debate and research in political and economic fields, with the exact 
pathways  being  unclear.  Some  mechanisms,  however,  seem  plausible.  Austerity 
measures  typically  involve  government  cutbacks  in  spending,  particularly  in  areas 
like social services, healthcare, and education. These cutbacks can lead to economic 
hardship for many citizens, particularly those in lower and middle-income brackets. 
When large segments of the population experience financial stress accompanied by 
often  substantial  impacts  on  their  quality  of  life,  there  can  be  growing  discontent 
with  the  status  quo.  Moreover,  as  austerity  often  follows  financial  crises  and  is 
sometimes imposed by external entities (like the International Monetary Fund or the 
European  Union),  it  can  lead  to  a  loss  of  trust  in  traditional  political  parties  and 
institutions.  People  may  be  easily  persuaded  that  their  government  is  no  longer 
representing  their  interests  but  is  instead  catering  to  financial  interests  of  rich 
people  or  corporations.  McKay,  Jennings  and  Stoker  (2023,  p.  1),  for  example, 
found  that  “clear  majorities  see  government  as  biased  towards  rich  areas  and 
capital cities, while around half of respondents perceive bias against rural areas.”  

Authoritarian  populist  leaders  often  capitalise  on  this  discontent.  They  typically 
position themselves as outside the traditional political establishment and promise to 
overturn  the  status  quo.  Their  rhetoric  often  includes  promises  to  end  austerity 
measures,  restore  economic  stability,  and  prioritise  the  needs  of  the  ‘ordinary’ 
citizen.  This  message  often  resonates  strongly  with  those  who  feel  left  behind  or 
ignored  by  mainstream  politics  (e.g.  Mudde  2007,  2014).  Similarly,  authoritarian 
populists tend to ignore climate change and environmental degradation, in order to 
pass  over  the  cost  associated  with  actions  required  to  address  them.  This,  again, 
typically  comes  at  the  cost  of  the  people  (often  those  already  disadvantaged)  who 
are  most  immediately,  and  most  negatively  affected  by  all  crises  –  which  is  why 
they  are  also  referred  to  as  ‘frontline  communities’  (Partida  2021;  see  also  EGE

Statement on Values in times of crisis, 2022; EGE Statement on European solidarity 
and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights  in  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  2020;  EGE-
GCSA  Join  Opinion  on  Joint  Opinion  Improving  pandemic  preparedness  and 
management, 2020). 

Austerity is an ideology that assumes that the state, like a private household, needs 
to  consolidate  its  finances  by  bringing  in  more  money  than  it  spends.  Its  origins 
date back to the second half of the 20th century. As a governmental programme it 
was adopted by some states after the banking crisis in 2008. While it rightly places 
emphasis  on  the  need  for  productive  spending,  it  misses  two  crucial  points.  First, 
states are not private households. The money that states spend is not ‘gone’ – it is 
with  the  people  who  spend  it  on  goods  and  services  and  thus  create  economic 
demand,  or  with  schools,  hospitals,  and  other  public  infrastructures  that  create 
educational,  health-related  or  other  value.  Second,  when  the  state  neglects  basic 
needs  of  people,  this  can  become  very  expensive  in  the  long  run,  as  increases  in 
child poverty, ill health and disability, and crime are often the consequence (Keeton 
1984;  Berger &  Waldfogel  (OECD)  2011;  Bourguignon  2018).  In  fact,  studies  have 
shown  that  austerity  programmes  often  undermine  their  own  stated  goals  of  cost 
saving (e.g. Konzelmann 2012; Nuti 2013; Schui 2014; Alesina, Favero & i Giavazzi 
2019).  

Against  this  backdrop,  it  seems  that  a  reorientation  of  Europe  to  its  social  roots  – 
understood  as  a  commitment  to  providing  a  dignified  life  for  everyone,  and  to 
avoiding  grave  levels  of  social  and  economic  injustice  –  would  also  provide  a 
protection  against  the  rise  of  authoritarianism.  This  is  in  line  with  the  thick 
conception  of  democracy  as  proposed  by  the  EGE,  as  one  that  builds  on  social 
welfare  and  equity  as  democracy’s  own  pre-conditions  (see  also  EGE  Opinion  on 
Democracy in the digital age, 2023).  

2.2.  Strengthening a broad variety of democratic 

practices 

Another  important  factor  in  the  rise  of  authoritarian  populism  is  what  is  often 
perceived  to  be  a  gap  between  decision-making  processes  and  the  direct 
representation  and  participation  of  citizens.  Populist  leaders  often  claim  that 
ordinary citizens have lost their voice in modern democratic systems, and view this 
as  a  sign  that  the  promises  of  democracy  as  a  system  of  collective  self-rule  are 
being  usurped.  This  is  typically  explained  in  terms  of  decision-making  elites  and 
institutions – be these political or economic – intentionally ignoring the needs of the 
people. While this elite conspiracy is certainly too simplistic, the claim that ordinary 
citizens’ ability to influence policy is limited (perhaps more so today than in earlier 
decades),  is  not  entirely  unfounded,  and  is  easily  instrumentalised  by  populist 
leaders. In the context of a large bureaucratic system such as the EU, and in light of 
the  complexity  and  global  nature  of  challenges  facing  societies  today  such  as  the 
climate crisis, such criticisms should not be dismissed outright as ‘populist’. Indeed, 
EU  decision-making,  especially  that  by  unelected  bodies  such  as  the  European 
Commission  and  the  European  Central  Bank,  can  be  criticised  as  lacking 
transparency  and  accountability  to  the  electorate.  Furthermore,  the  expanding  but 
still limited competences of the European Parliament can raise concerns about a lack 
of  genuine  democratic  oversight  and  influence  by  EU  citizens  over  policies  that 

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 11 

 
 
 
Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

directly  affect  them  (De  Búrca  2020;  Seubert  2023).  Although  research  thus  far 
does not show straightforward links between a democratic deficit in the EU and the 
rise  of  authoritarian  populism,  it  is  important  to  address  democratic  deficits  where 
they  do  exist  and  further  explore  the  complex  interplay  of  the  developments  at 
stake.  This  can  improve  the  trustworthiness  of  democratic  institutions,  weaken  the 
appeal  of  authoritarian  populism,  and  make  good  on  the 
inclusive  and 
representative ideals of thick democracy. 

One solution that is frequently proposed in this context is sortition, which refers to 
the use of a random selection process to appoint people to public office (e.g. Parker 
2011;  Stone  2011;  Van  Reybrouck  2016;  Fishkin  2018).  Sortition  is  seen  by  some 
authors  as  an  effective  way  to  address  various  democratic  deficits  commonly 
observed  in  electoral  political  systems,  such  as  enhancing  representativeness,  or 
reducing  partisanship  and  polarisation:  By  removing  the  competitive  element  of 
elections,  sortition  can  lead  to  the  formation  of  decision-making  bodies  that  are 
more  focused  on  deliberation  and  consensus  rather  than  on  party  loyalty  and 
opposition. Sortition could also help to claw back corruption and regulatory capture, 
in  the  sense  of  the  ‘capture’  of  regulators  by  large  corporations  and  other 
economically powerful actors. Some authors also believe that sortition can improve 
the quality of decision making, as with a more diverse group of people in decision-
making roles there can be a wider range of perspectives and experiences brought to 
innovative  and  effective  solutions. 
the  table,  potentially 
Additionally,  because  sortition  can  reduce  the  influence  of  special  interest  groups, 
decisions might better reflect the general interest. At the same time, concerns have 
been raised about the lack of expertise of randomly selected people, and the lack of 
accountability of people who have not been formally elected. Moreover, the concept 
of  sortition  might  be  difficult  for  those  for  whom  democratic  legitimacy  is  strongly 
tied  to  electoral  processes.  Finally,  the  sortition  system  could  be  vulnerable  to 
manipulation. Given these potential drawbacks (Fishkin & Laslett 2008; Rosanvallon 
2011),  many  advocates  of  sortition  suggest  using  it  in  conjunction  with  traditional 
electoral  systems,  rather  than  replacing  them  entirely.  This  approach  can  help 
mitigate  some  of  the  risks  while  still  harnessing  the  benefits  of  incorporating  more 
randomly selected citizen bodies into the governance structure. 

leading  to  more 

Another  solution  that  is  promoted  to  address  democratic  deficits,  and  particularly 
the  shortcomings  of  representative  democracy,  are  deliberative  and  collaborative 
digital platforms that can make it easier for a wider range of people to participate in 
political discussions and decisions (Errandonea 2023). The development and use of 
such digital tools to enrich democratic deliberation is a very welcome development. 
However,  such  tools  are  not  sufficient  to  address  the  ailments  of  representative 
democracy. People who stop showing up for elections do so not because voting has 
become  too  onerous,  but  because  they  are  increasingly  disillusioned  about  their 
ability to effectively influence decisions that affect their lives (e.g. De Tullio 2021).2 

2  In  Europe,  Zilinsky  (2019)  found  that  younger  people  are  generally  more  satisfied  with 
democracy  than  older  citizens,  and  that  satisfaction  with  democracy  has  actually  increased 
among Europeans of all ages. Other studies find evidence of a growing number of democrats in 
name  only,  particularly  among  the  young  generation  (Wuttke,  Gavras  &  Schoen  2022). 
Moreover, in countries hit hard by the Eurozone crisis younger people have been found to be 
increasingly EU-sceptical (Lauterbach & De Vries 2020).

Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

Democracy as a system of collective self-rule is guided by the ideals that everyone 
is able to influence decisions that significantly affect their lives, and that there is the 
freedom  and  a  reasonable  possibility  to  participate  in  collective  judgement  on  the 
issues  at  hand  (Warren  2001,  60;  see  Goodin  2007).  Fair  and  free  elections  are  a 
necessary condition to reach these ideals, but they are not sufficient. For example, 
without  substantive  deliberation  and  the  access  of  citizens  to  good  information, 
voting becomes an empty ritual. The same is true if people feel that their vote does 
not affect key decisions made about economic affairs: an example is the setting of 
interest rates which is, in many      countries, exempt from meaningful democratic 
control,  even  though  interest  rates  have  huge  implications  on  people’s  lives  and 
economic inequalities. When citizens feel that, via their vote, they have no say over 
things that matter, they disengage from formal democratic processes. This does not 
mean that they are becoming less ‘political’ – but their political activity then moves 
to other places. 

Two  conclusions  follow  from  this.  First,  it  is  very  important  to  ensure  that  people, 
via  their  vote,  have  control  over  things  that  matter  –  meaning,  in  turn,  that 
important  economic  affairs  need  to  be  moved  back  to  the  domain  of  democratic 
decision  making  (e.g.  Cumbers  2012;  McGaughey  2020).  Second,  the  spaces  in 
which other political activity takes place should not be seen as ‘outside’ democracy, 
but  instead  as  an  important  part  of  the  democratic  domain.  Activity  within  such 
spaces is also known as ‘associative democracy’. 

2.3.  Associative democracy  

The  notion  of  ‘associative  democracy’  refers  to  democratic  practices  that  rest  on  a 
moral vision of a good society to be achieved by citizens who interact freely and, in 
the  process,  enhance  their  own  political  capacity  and  that  of  society  at  large 
(McPherson,  1977,  60;  Wagenaar  2023).  In  this  view,  associations,  such  as  grass 
roots community organisations, contribute to the social integration of citizens, act as 
an  interface  between  the  individual  and  political  decision  makers,  and  play  an 
important role in the provision of services, in particular in the social sector (Freise & 
Hallmann 2014). According to the conception of associative democracy, groups and 
associations  of  citizens  actively  participate  in  governance  and  societal  decision-
making  with  a  sense  of  responsibility  towards  the  broader  community  and  a 
willingness  to  engage  in  dialogue  and  compromise.  The  state's  role  is  to  ensure 
conditions  which  are  favourable  for  this,  and to help  maintain  balance  and  prevent 
dominance  of  certain  groups.  Bas  van  Bavel  (2022)  has  shown  on  the  basis  of 
historical  economic  analysis  that  such  associations  have  acted  as  strong  mitigators 
of regressive taxes and rampant inequity in important periods of European history. 
They can help to improve prosperity and economic growth (ibid.). 

The  first  half  of  the  twentieth  century  saw  the  emergence  of  all  kinds  of 
cooperatives,  funds  and  unions.  However,  these  systems  of  self-organisation  got 
caught between market and state at the end of the last century. As they matured, 
they had to navigate a complex space defined by the external pressures of both the 
market  economy  and  state  policies.  While  some  cooperative  movements  were 
initially  formed  with  a  degree  of  independence  from  state  control,  over  time, 
governmental  policies  and  regulations  came  to  limit  their  operations  –  e.g.  by 
imposing  regulatory  burdens  that  complicate  the  cooperative  model,  or  state 
support  that  co-opts  or  dilutes  their  autonomous  character.  Navigating  these 

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 13 

 
 
 
Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

challenges often meant that cooperatives had to drift from their original ideals and 
to adopt more conventional business practices to remain viable in the market or to 
align with governmental agendas to secure legal and financial support. 

At  this  time,  having  learned  the  lessons  of  the  past,  a  revival  of  (support  for)  civil 
associations  would  be  timely.  Free  associations  could  counteract  the  corrosive 
effects of the dominance of the market model of electoral liberal democracy, where 
citizens  are  seen  as  ‘consumers’  of  political  ‘choices’  and  politicians  as  ‘suppliers’ 
competing for the vote (Macpherson 1977, p. 76). Associative democracy could also 
be seen as a middle ground between free-market individualism and centralised state 
control  (see  Hirst  2001,  in  Hirst  &  Bader,  2001),  especially  where  there  was  the 
political will to devolve power to voluntary associations (Jones & Marsden 2010).    

One  of  the  strengths  of  (formal  or  informal)  associations  of  citizens  is  that  they 
realise  the  ideal  of  giving  everyone  the  possibility  of  participating  in  collective 
judgement  at  the  level  where  it  is  best  informed  and  counts  most.  For  example,  a 
citizen  group  which produces  green  energy  will  have  hands-on  experience  with  the 
practical  contingencies  of  the  green  energy  transition,  will  have  reflected  on  the 
climate  crises,  has  built  support  in  the  community  for  the  cause  of  sustainable 
energy  use,  might  have  experienced  pushback  from  corporate  energy  providers 
and/or  the  state,  and  so  on.  As  the  example  makes  clear,  such  associations  also 
have  decision  making  power  within  their  civic  sphere.  Associations  can  get  things 
done; they can realise their goals within a geographically or domain-specific sphere 
(Wagenaar 2019). This decision-making power is crucial to the idea and practice of 
associational  democracy.  In  other  words,  civic  associations  can  address  pressing 
societal and environmental issues that individuals on their own cannot solve. This is 
what  makes  them  suitable  partners  for  public  agencies.  Civic  associations  by 
themselves  do  not  have  the  power  to  govern  society.  But  they  are  important 
subsidiary  structures  that  are  necessary  to  connect  public  administration  and 
business to the people.  

In  other  words,  civic  associations  should  not  be  seen  as  acting  outside,  or  acting 
against, democratic institutions or processes. They cannot, and should not, supplant 
the  aggregate  institutions  of  the  state.  Instead,  they  play  an  important  subsidiary 
role.  Certain  state  functions  can  be  effectively  devolved  to  civic  associations  (Hirst 
1994, Cohen and Rogers 1995). The role of the state in this respect is to protect and 
support civic associations. Parliamentary and executive rule would still be necessary 
to  debate  large  questions  of  national  or  international  import  (such  as  state  budget 
allocations,  social  security,  security,  global  trade,  participation  in  transnational 
institutions, major national infrastructure projects). In other areas, associations can 
be  key  actors  which  are  organised  in  domain-specific  confederations,  in  which  the 
confederate  board  participates  in  national  institutions  (Bookchin  1990).  This  is 
hardly  a  new  idea:  variations  of  it  have  been  widely  practised  in  various  corporate 
arrangements in continental European states. For example, the over 500 citizen care 
initiatives  that  have  emerged  in  the  Netherlands  over  the  last  decade  are 
represented  by  an  umbrella  organisation  that  now  has  a  voice  in  national  policy 
making (see Bourgon 2011 and De Souza Briggs 2008 for more examples).  

Some  forms  of  associative  democracy  can  help  to  better  connect  state  and  civil 
society  in  policy  making  and  implementation.  One  classic  example  is  the  Porto 
Alegre  participatory  budgeting  initiative.  The  initiative  cleverly  merged  political 
decision making at municipal level on the one hand and centralised coordination on 
the other so that the city budget was representative both of the priorities of the city 

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 14 

 
 
Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

districts  and  larger  interests  of  the  city.  Participatory  budgeting  has  been  widely 
implemented  across  the  world,  often  in  watered-down  versions.  The  singular 
success of the Porto Alegre initiative seems to depend on the city’s unique political 
makeup. The city had a longstanding socialist administration; in cities with different 
political  leadership  participatory  budgeting  was  much  less  successful  (Avritzer, 
2009).  

Another approach is to infuse public administration with large doses of deliberation. 
This approach is promising as it has proven to be able to resolve policy impasse and 
conflict  and  generate  creative  solutions  for  difficult,  evolving  policy  problems 
(Forester  2009;  Innes  &  Booher  2010;  Curato  et  al.  2017).  In  Ireland,  twice  in 
recent history a citizens’ assembly was appointed to deliberate major constitutional 
questions, both times leading to a referendum and the successful passing of reforms 
for  marriage  equality  in  the  first  case  (in  2015)  and  abortion  rights  in  the  second 
case  (in  2018).  This  “linking  of  deliberative  democracy  (mini-publics)  and  direct 
democracy  (referendums)”  has  been  described  as  exemplary  and  as  a  model  for 
how constitutional deliberation may be systematised (Farrell, Suiter & Harris 2019).3 

Furthermore,  associative democracy  also  fulfils  another  important  function,  namely 
the monitoring of power elites. Civic associations hold governments and businesses 
accountable  and  pressure  them  to  act  on  unacceptable  social  ills  and  urgent 
problems.  They  influence  the  political  agenda.  Without  civic  associations  we  would 
not  have  had  a  divest  and  #keepitintheground  movement.  At  the  moment  social 
movements are the main actors in creating the necessary urgency in fighting global 
warming. They are a key element in what the democratic theorist John Keane calls 
‘monitory  democracy’.  He  describes  it  as  a  new  phase  in  the  development  of 
democracy,  “a  ‘post-parliamentary’  politics  defined  by  the  rapid  growth  of  many 

3  The  European  Commission  has,  in  recent  years,  strongly  promoted  and  further  developed 
infrastructures of  participatory  and deliberative democracy  at  both  the  EU  and Member  State 
level: through the  Conference on the Future of Europe, the  Citizen Engagement platform and 
the December 2023 Recommendation to the Member States on citizen participation.  

The  Centre  for  Participatory  and  Deliberative  Democracy  of  the  European  Commission’s  Joint 
Research  Centre  (JRC)  has  also  supported  this  work,  including  via  the  establishment  of  a 
community  of  practice  platform  around  participatory  and  deliberative  democracy,  its 
Enlightenment  2.0  programme  and  the  resulting  reports  (with  an  additional  report  on  public 
communication and democracy in preparation), as well as its work on evidence-informed policy 
making. 

Horizon  Europe,  the  Framework  Programme  for  Research  and  Innovation,  established  in  its 
legal  basis  a  specific  ‘intervention  area’  on  democracy  and  governance.  Under  this 
programmed area, and over its first three years (2021-2023), Horizon Europe has funded over 
70  research  projects  with  more  than  €200M.  The  2024  call  will  add  30  more  projects  and 
around €100M. The complete list of ongoing projects is available via CORDIS and a selection of 
previous projects as well as relevant publications is available here.  

The European Research Council (ERC) grants have mobilised funding for research on relevant 
democracy-related  issues.  The  recent  report  Mapping  ERC  Frontier  Research:  Democracy 
brings  together  the  contributions  from  ERC-funded  curiosity-driven  research  on  the  complex 
challenges  facing  democratic  systems  today  and  presents  project  highlights  in  six  thematic 
areas:  democratic  governance  and  political  representation;  elections  and  voting;  citizen 
engagement; human rights and rule of law; disinformation, fake news, and social media; and 
polarisation, populism, and authoritarianism.

3. STRENGTHENING EUROPEAN IDENTITY: TOWARDS A 
‘THICK’ UNDERSTANDING OF EUROPEAN IDENTITY  

As Evelyn Ruppert and Stephan Scheel argue (Ruppert & Scheel 2021, p. 6; see also 
Balibar 2003, Barry & Walters 2003, Shore 2000; Tava & Quenivet 2023): 

“answers  to  the  question  of  legitimacy  are  not  to  be  found  in  grand 
political statements by major figures or theories of how Europe can be 
made into a new political entity. Rather than attempting to address an 
imaginary demos or conjuring it up in proclamations about a European 
identity,  critical  scholars  have  shown  it  is  through  specific  practices 
such  as  laws,  regulations,  customs,  histories,  and  institutions  that 
Europe is  enacted  and  continuously  remade.” (Ruppert &  Scheel  2021, 
p. 6) 

As these authors argue “the EU is brought into being via myriad practices” (Ruppert 
&  Scheel  2021,  p.  6;  see  also  Kohlrausch  &  Trischler  2014).  The  notion  of  a 
‘European identity’ is as  multifaceted and complex as these practices. The remarks 
of the mediaeval historian Johan Huizinga (1924/1955, p. 228) in his The Waning of 
the  Middle  Ages  about  understanding  cultures  in  general  may  also  be  applicable  to 
European identity: he argues that the most telling characteristics are not those that 
are  explicitly  discussed  in  learned  books  or  mentioned  by  commentators,  but  the 
things that  are  taken  for granted  by  everyone  and are  the  foundation  of  all  that  is 
being said and done. 

The idea of building a European identity goes back to Erasmus of Rotterdam.  It was 
fuelled further by Immanuel Kant’s ideas about federalism, and the cosmopolitanism 
of the European Enlightenment. Nevertheless, the question both of the existence of 
a  European  identity,  and  what  it  might  consist  of,  has  remained  open  (Beck  & 
Grande, 2007; Kaina & Karolewski, 2013; Onghena, 2016). 

The  European  Union  project  has  given  new  life  to  the  debate  around  these 
questions.  Initially,  at  the  very  beginning  of  the  European  Union  project,  this  was 
framed mainly in the form of the question: ‘Is there a European identity?’ Later, as 
the  project  evolved  from  its  original  conception  as  an  economic  community  to  a 
community  of  citizens,  especially  since the  Maastricht  Treaty  in  1992,  the  question 
has  tended  to  be  rephrased  as  ‘what  does  it  mean  to  be  European?’  In  the  last 
decade or so, especially since the financial crisis of 2007 and the multitude of crises 
that  followed  (economic,  social,  health),  the  European  project  has  begun  to  be 
challenged,  and  with  it  the  notion  of  a  European  identity.  The  question  has,  then, 
become ‘does a European identity still exist?’ 

In national and European politics, questioning the possibility of a European identity 
has also become a means of disputing its existence, of dismantling it. It has played 
an  important  role  in  promoting  protectionist  and  nationalist  trends  and  has  been 
mobilised  by  far-right  populist  movements  seeking  to  weaken  the  European  Union 
as a civic and cultural entity.

Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

In  this  context,  turning  the  question  ‘does  a  European  identity  still  exist?’  into 
whether such a European identity is possible at all,  reflects a growing protectionist 
and  nationalist  trend,  which  advocates  closed  societies,  excluding  diversity  and 
returning  to  discriminatory,  intolerant,  presumably  homogenous  societies,  often 
driven by far-right populist movements. By questioning the possibility of a European 
identity, these movements are aiming to break up the European Union and to erode 
democracy.  We  argue  that  European  identity  and  democracy  are  inseparable,  and 
both  are  strong  pillars  of  the  European  Union.  Regardless  of  where  one  stands 
regarding  the  value  of  a  European  identity,  it  seems  clear  that  strengthening  a 
European  identity  cannot  singlehandedly  solve  the  problems  of  democratic 
backsliding  or  abolish  other  threats  to  our  democracies.  We  believe  that  it  can, 
however,  contribute  to  broadening  and  enhancing  people's  participation  in  society, 
promoting  greater  proximity  between  citizens  and  those  in  power  (legislative  and 
executive  powers),  and  thus  helping  protect  societies  against  the  rise  of  populism 
and other antidemocratic developments. 

3.1.  Two dimensions of European identity 

Europe is a space shared by different peoples and nations, with a rich diversity (also 
within societies) in its histories, cultures, religions, and languages, characterised by 
relations of both strife and peaceful co-existence. Europe is indeed not restricted to 
being a geographical concept, just as European identity is not restricted to defining 
a physical cohabitation in that space. 

Broadly  speaking,  collective  identities  refer  to  the  identification  of  individuals  with 
larger  groups  based  on  (what  they  perceive  to  be)  shared  characteristics, 
experiences, or affiliations. These identities are formed through complex social and 
psychological processes. Even when collective identities form around labels such as 
nationality,  ethnicity,  religion,  gender,  political  beliefs,  or  shared  historical 
experiences,  they  always  need  to  be  continually  nurtured  and  cultivated,  for 
example  through  rituals  and  public  celebrations  of  selected  elements  of  collective 
histories. 

European  identity  can  be  understood  as  having  two  dimensions.  The  first  is  of  a 
political,  legal  and  administrative  nature  and  translates  into  the  notion  of 
citizenship,  i.e.  a  set  of  rights  and  duties  arising  from  being  a  citizen  of  a  Member 
State  of  the  European  Union.  This  is  a  formal  identity,  legally  attributed  or 
recognised,  and  certified  by  a  public  document.  A  second  dimension  pertains  to 
people’s experience of ‘being European’. It emerges through shared experiences and 
manifests  in  a  feeling  of  togetherness,  a  sense  of  community.  It  refers  to  the 
sharing  of  values  and  principles  of  action  that  shape  our  relationships  to  other 
people  as  well  as  to  institutions.  This  is  a  substantive  identity,  embodied  in  a 
common  way  of  life  in  the  sense  that  it  is  bound  by  the  same  norms,  such  as 
respect  for  human  rights.  As  any  identity,  it  is  a  model  of  community  life  that  is 
constructed, chosen and cultivated by each individual and collectively. This is not, of 
course,  to  say  that  the  values  concerned,  such  as  justice,  solidarity  and  freedom, 
are specific to any particular region, but rather that collective experiences within a 
region  shape  the  pre-eminence  given  to  particular  universal  values  within  its 
collective identity.

Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

In  other  words,  while  the  first  dimension  of  European  identity  is  synonymous  with 
citizenship  (formal),  the  second  is  a  way  of  being,  behaving  and  relating  to others 
(substantive). The two can exist separately: on the one hand, a citizen of a Member 
State is automatically a European citizen and this citizenship can also be granted to 
a  person  moving  to  an  EU  Member  State,  without  either  of  them  necessarily 
identifying with European values; on the other hand, some people actively choose to 
live  within  the  European Union  because  they  share,  and  identify  with,  its  collective 
values,  even  without  (yet)  having  European  citizenship.  Both  dimensions  are 
essential  for  a  broad  and  comprehensive  understanding  of  European  identity,  and 
they are also mutually related: the strength of the former depends on the existence 
of  the  latter,  and  the  experience  of  the  latter  is  protected  by  the  former.  In  other 
words, citizenship as a legal membership of a society is strengthened by the feeling 
of  belonging  that  encourages  participation  in  community  life;  and  the development 
of a shared co-existence is protected and can be nourished by its political and legal 
framework.  

3.2.  The reciprocal strengthening of a thick 

understanding of democracy and a thick 
understanding of identity 

In analogy to conceptions of thin and thick democracy, the formal understanding of 
identity  underpins  what  we  can  call  a  ‘thin’  identity.  A  ‘thick’  understanding  of 
European  identity,  in  contrast,  consists  of  a  sense  of  belonging  to  a  European 
community, grounded in a set of fundamental shared values. Along      with respect 
for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, we highlight those that contribute 
most to social cohesion, including: equality for all; appreciation of diversity; equity 
in  the  distribution  of  social  goods;  and  solidarity  with  those  who  need  it  most. 
Sharing  these  values,  respecting  everyone's  dignity  and  being  inspired  by  the 
conviction  that  together  we  are  able  to  contribute  to  a  better  society,  to  the 
common good, leads to a feeling of being a part of this community. This experience 
of being part of a community, this feeling of belonging can generate both a strong 
sense  of  pride  and  the  acceptance  of  responsibility:  pride  in  the  norms  and 
institutions  that  uphold  them,  such  as  the  rule  of  law  and  human  rights;  and 
responsibility to be an active participant in building society. 

A  thick  understanding  of  European  identity  needs  to  further  highlight  the  role  of 
historical events, historiography and common memory in shaping and consolidating 
our  values.  Respect  for  human  dignity,  human  rights,  equality,  social  solidarity, 
tolerance,  etc.  changes  over  time,  and  has  strongly  developed  in  Europe  through 
the  shared  experience  of  several  traumatic  conflicts,  which  included  the  terrors  of 
‘ethnic cleansing’, totalitarian regimes, and international wars, as well as its colonial 
past.  Put  differently,  our  values  reflect  and  respond  to  the  common  historical 
memory  of  Europe’s  people.  As  such,  these  values  form  a  core  component  of 
European identity, and they need to be rearticulated in EU initiatives and policies.

come together 

Understood  in  this  way,  identity  and  democracy  can  mutually  strengthen  one 
another. The greater a person’s identification with a community defined by its set of 
values,  the  greater  their  willingness  to  be  involved  in  its  governance.  We  always 
invest  in  what  we  belong  to,  in  what  we  feel  is  ours  and  is  our  right,  and  in  our 
power,  to  shape.  And  the  greater  a  role  someone  plays  in  the  governance  of  their 
community,  the  greater  their  sense  of  identification  with  that  community.  Just  as 
the more we get involved, the more we feel that we belong to it.  

3.3.  Barriers to strengthening a European identity 

Currently, we cannot say that the majority of people in Europe experience and enact 
such  a  ‘thick’  European  identity;  Brexit  is  only  one  of  the  most  visible  examples 
suggesting the opposite. At the same time, the feared post-Brexit fragmentation of 
the  European  Union  has  not  occurred.  On  the  contrary,  studies  indicate  that  the 
sense  of  being  European  has  intensified  (e.g.  Malik,  2018).  What  this  has  shown, 
however, is that European identity is highly dependent on events not directly related 
to  it:  internal,  such  as  the  various  national decisions  made  by  member  states,  like 
Brexit;  or  external,  such  as  events  taking  place  in  the  world  and  affecting  Europe 
directly  (for  example,  the  increase  in  the  number  of  people  moving  to  Europe)  or 
indirectly (for example, the war in Ukraine and the energy or food price crisis). 

One of the main barriers in the construction and tightening of European identity has 
been the unclear relationship between European citizenship and national citizenship, 
perhaps  due  to  the  ancillary  or  supplemental  character  of  European  citizenship  in 
relation  to  national  citizenship.  European  citizenship,  in  its  legal  form,  is  “derived” 

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 20 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

from national citizenship (Lacroix 2021) in that it is legally contingent upon being a 
citizen  of  one  of  the  EU  member  states.  This  means  that  there  is  no  standalone 
European  citizenship  independent  of  national  citizenship.  This  arrangement  is 
outlined  in  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union,  which  defines 
European  citizenship  as  an  additional  status  to  national  citizenship.  This  structure 
reflects  the  EU’s  foundational  principle  of  “unity  in  diversity,”  which  respects  the 
unique  cultures,  languages,  and  political  systems  of  its  member  states  while 
fostering a common identity and legal framework at the European level.       

The dependency of European citizenship on national citizenship, however, also raises 
questions  about  inclusivity  and  the  political  integration  of  the  EU.  It  can  lead  to 
complex  situations  in  areas  like  rights  entitlements,  political  participation,  and  the 
conceptualization  of  citizenship  beyond  the  nation-state.  Critics  argue  that  this 
might  limit  the  depth  of  political  integration  and  the  development  of  a  standalone 
European  identity  that  transcends  national  boundaries  (see  Lacroix  2021). 
Moreover,  while  political  advocates  framed  the  introduction  of  European  citizenship 
as  a  paradigm  shift,  in  practice  it  may  lack  some  characteristics of  democratic  and 
social  citizenship in the  traditions  of  the  Member  States  (Seubert 2023),  such  as  a 
broader  and  more  direct  involvement of  citizens in European  governance.  After  all, 
only the members of the European Parliament are directly elected by the people. In 
recognition  of  the  limited  scope  for  direct  citizen  participation  in  European 
institutions, initiatives such as Europe for Citizens, the EU’s programme for funding 
projects that “encourage citizens to participate and engage in democracy at the EU 
level” and “help the public understand the EU's history, values and diversity”,4 have 
been successively creating mechanisms and channels to increase the possibilities for 
citizens to effectively intervene in public policies.  

Despite  such  attempts  to  increase  direct  participation  at  EU  level,  in  recent  years, 
European  integration  has  continued  to  be  criticised  and  at  times  undermined  by 
right-wing  populist  parties  and  other  political  forces  that  are  hostile  to  European 
integration.  The  problem  here  is  not  only  that  the  types  of  national  identities  that 
these parties promote are often defined in nativist terms and thus incompatible with 
an  inclusive  European  identity,  but  also  that  authoritarian  populism  contributes  to 
‘Europe’  being  associated  with  negative  things  such  as  increased  insecurity  linked 
with  the  increase  in  immigration,  and  the  weakening  of  authority  linked  with  the 
strengthening of minority rights. Furthermore, as concerns about economic hardship 
and  levels  of  migration  have  increasingly  come  to  dominate  public  debate  and 
election  campaigns,  authoritarian  populist  parties  have  succeeded  in  channelling 
these  fears  into  opposition  to  EU  integration,  and  scapegoating  EU  policy  as  the 
cause of these problems.   

The  enlargement  of  European  integration  is  portrayed  by  many  authoritarian 
populist  forces  as  a  threat  to  the  strengthening  of  national  identities  that  these 
parties  defend.  For  example,  right-wing  populists  have  critiqued  the  alleged  top-
down  process  of  EU  integration,  the  transfer  of  policy-making  authority  from 
Member  States  to  the  EU,  and  a  perceived  pro-European  decision-making  elite  in 
their own countries and in Brussels.

3.4.  Towards a doubly inclusive and a multi-layered 

European identity 

We  suggest  that  European  identity  can  be  built  and  strengthened  through  two 
strands of inclusivity: internally, i.e. within the European area and among European 
citizens; and externally, i.e. as a community of values that welcomes and integrates 
diversity and promotes its values beyond its geographical borders.  

Externally,  it  is  important  that  the  EU  asserts  its  identity  as  a  community  built  on 
respect for human rights and fundamental values. As such, it is heterogeneous but 
united  by  the  sharing  of  these  values  and  the  pursuit  of  justice  and  solidarity, 
welcoming  differences  and  promoting  their  integration.  In  the  form  of  diversity, 
differences  can  contribute  to  the  development  and  improvement  of  societies.  They 
can  make  them  more  creative  and  innovative  by  valuing  different  ideas  and 
experiences,  which  in  turn  leads  to  better  problem-solving  (Page  2008),  and  thus, 
more resilience (Linkov, Trump & Kiker 2022). 

Internally, within the EU, it is important to emphasise that national citizenship does 
not  compete  with  European  citizenship,  just  as  what  is  sometimes  called  regional 
citizenship (in the sense of belonging to, and taking pride in, the region in which one 
was  born  and/or  lives,  and  within  ‘a  Europe  of  Regions’)  does  not  compete  with 
national  citizenship.  It  is  to  be  expected  that  feelings  of  belonging  are  stronger  at 
local  levels  due  to  greater  proximity.  But  in  a  globalised  and  connected  world, 
physical proximity is not the only kind of closeness, and not the only reference point 
for  relations  and  solidarity.  Besides,  it  has  become  clear  that,  in  the  face  of  the 
successive crises that have hit Europe, the union of Member States makes each one 
stronger, as has been seen in the fight against Covid-19. 

Ideally,  every  European  citizen  should  feel  that  they  can  hold  multiple  identities, 
including  regional  or  local,  national,  and  European.  This  concept  of  multiple 
identities  has  been  studied  in  depth  and  different  terminology  has  been  applied, 
such as ‘layered identities’, ‘hybrid identities’, ‘entangled identities’ and many others 
(Straubhaar  2008;  Zimmerbauer,  Suutari  &  Saartenoja  2012).  Such  an  entangled 
understanding  of  identity  fits  with  the  ‘thick’  understanding  of  democracy  that  we 
have been promoting, in which members recognise themselves in, and feel a sense 
of belonging to, more than one community or group. It clashes with the conception 
of a strong national identity, promoted by nativist populism (Aichholzer, Kritzinger & 
Plescia  2021).  Such  a  layered  understanding  of  identity  is  also  what  enables  a 
person  to  affiliate  themselves  with  a  particular  region  or  group,  a  specific  nation, 
and the EU at the same time. These multiple identities do not have to compete with 
each other, as is sometimes assumed. They can and do co-exist, become salient at 
different times and in different contexts, and can intersect in important ways. They 
are cumulative and complementary, and they sometimes even reinforce each other. 
They can also change over time.

3.5.  A new narrative of European identity 

This multifaceted, thick conception of identity needs robust narratives built upon an 
inclusive  sense  of  belonging.  Stories  and  narratives  about  a  group's  historical 
memory,  struggles,  achievements,  and  goals  help  members  make  sense  of  their 
group identities and their significance. 

The  political  scientist  and  anthropologist  Benedict  Anderson  (Anderson,  1983) 
famously argued that nations are ‘imagined communities’ insofar as their members, 
despite  often  not  knowing  each  other,  imagine  belonging  to  the  same  collective 
entity.  Communities  do  not  just  exist:  They  are  always  socially  constructed –  with 
shared  narratives,  rituals,  and  symbols  that  turn  a  group  of  people  into  a 
‘community of fate’ (Grimm 2023) and that hold collective memories and identities 
in  place.  Our  choice  of  words  to  describe  and  characterise  them,  the  ideas  or 
arguments that aggregate the facts and substantiate the interpretations, the values 
highlighted as framing the realities and the feelings and emotions that we add, that 
is,  the  narratives  we  interweave,  are  paramount.  They  are  needed  to  meaningfully 
bind together citizens who do not know each other in person. 

Anti-democratic  regimes  and  many  authoritarian  populist  leaders  know  well  the 
value  of  identity  narratives  and  are  skilful  in  the  art  of  appropriating  and  retelling 
identity  narratives.  They  have  been  successful  in  constructing  and  bolstering 
nationalist  identities  through  emotional  appeals  to  ‘primordial’  bonds,  rituals  and 
symbols,  to  ‘traditional  ways  of  life’  and  by  promoting  beliefs  about  perceived 
threats  to  these,  whether  from  immigrants,  elites  or  through  various  other 
conspiracy  theories.  While  identities  can  be  based  on  a  concept  of  the  community 
that stresses ‘ethnic’ or other nativist forms of unity, alleged common descent and 
cultural  homogeneity,  as  is  often  the  case  in  right-wing  populist  discourses,  they 
need  not  be  constructed  in  such  exclusionary  ways  (Dowds  &  Young  1996;  Mounk 
2018;  Illouz  2023).  They  can,  instead,  be  constructed  in  ways  that  highlight  the 
values of diversity, tolerance and openness as that which defines them. Pluralism, in 
the form of respect for a broad range of identities, languages, and practices as long 
as  they  conform  to  respect  for  human  and  civil  rights,  strengthens  rather  than 
detracts from a shared European identity. Similarly, while identities can emphasise a 
blind allegiance and a surrendering of one’s will to a leader, as we are increasingly 
seeing  in  regimes  which  slide  from  democracy  and  rule  of  law  to  authoritarianism, 
they  can  also  emphasise  a  critical  and  questioning  attitude  towards  authorities, 
underpinned  by  information,  high  levels  of  political  involvement  and  trust  in  the 
institutions that protect diversity, tolerance and openness (Schatz, Staub & Lavine, 
1999).  Such  an  identity  would  be  based  in  a  civic  consciousness  more  than  in  an 
‘ethnicised’ one. It entails that, not despite but because of the supra-national nature 
of  the  EU,  it  is  possible  to  foster  inspiring  and  democratic  counter-narratives  that 
help  to  forge  a  European  identity  which  is  defined  by  inclusive  values  and  the 
institutions  that  uphold  them,  and  that  these  benefit  all  European  citizens.  This  is 
the thick identity that should be paired with a thick understanding of democracy.

4. DEMOCRACY AND DEMOGRAPHY 

Demographic changes can also have effects on democracy, directly or indirectly. For 
example, they can lead to tensions and concerns regarding the affordability of social 
security  arrangements  (e.g.  pensions)  as  well  as  labour  shortages.  The  gradual 
population decline experienced by some EU Member States (Italy, Greece, Romania, 
Latvia,  Bulgaria,  Croatia,  etc.)  can  affect  economic  activity  –  especially  when  the 
decline  is  a  consequence  of  the  "brain  drain"  phenomenon  that  deprives  the 
economy of highly skilled labour – and lead to new issues that, if left unaddressed 
by  politicians  and  policy  makers,  will  affect  voting  and  other  forms  of  political 
engagement.  For  example,  the  concentration  of  the  population  in  large  urban 
centres and the abandonment of rural areas may in the long-term lead to a shortage 
of  essential  foodstuffs  and  even  environmental  problems  (due  to  the  allocation  of 
land  to  industrial  activity).  It  is  also  likely  to  imply  social  inequalities  to  the 
detriment  of  those  who  choose  to  live  in  rural  communities,  where  it  is  no  longer 
for  transport, 
considered  important  to  create  the  necessary 
healthcare, education, etc.  

infrastructure 

Solutions  may  lie  in  policies  that  take  account  of,  and  respond  to,  the  diverse 
impacts of demographic changes, including on democracy. As our democracies build 
on inclusivity, diversity and equity, maintaining them also means ensuring respectful 
and  meaningful  integration  of  potentially  or  actually  disadvantaged  demographic 
groups. It also means fiercely countering attempts that abuse demographic changes 
and the vulnerable position of some to generate narrations of scapegoating that only 
do harm to our societies. And it means reacting to demographic developments that 
have the potential of detrimentally impacting democracy (and the realisation of the 
values sustaining it) in the future, by means of foresight, prevention and mitigation.

Defending democracy in Europe: Addressing the threat of authoritarian populism and reinforcing democratic practice 

CONCLUSION 

Democracy  is  under  threat  around  the  world.  A  much  greater  share  of  the  world’s 
population lives in autocracies today than in democracies. In the last decade, their 
proportion  has  increased  further.  At  the  same  time,  the  quality  of  democracy  has 
also been declining in many parts of the world. 

In particular, substantive and pluralistic conceptions of democracy have come under 
pressure  and  require  reinforcement.  In  such  ‘thick’  understandings,  democracy  is 
not merely a formal regime consisting of periodic free elections but is committed to 
protecting  and  promoting  fundamental  rights  and  values,  as  well  as  practices  of 
lived  democracy.  What  is  needed  now  is  strategic  action  to  counter  the  erosion  of 
democratic  institutions  and  practices  and  to  protect  and  improve  the  quality  of 
democracy  in  the  European  Union  as  the  model  of  socio-political  organisation  that 
best protects individuals and improves the well-being of communities. 

Against this backdrop, the EGE considers that: 

•  Democracy cannot be taken for granted. It needs to be nurtured: on the one 
hand  by  political  powers  in  a  closer  dialogue  with  the  people,  and  on  the 
other  by  citizens  in  a  strong  and  meaningful  participation  in  civic  and 
political life; 

•  Authoritarian  forms  of  populism  pose  one  of  the  biggest  threats  to  ‘thick’ 
democracies,  and  are  strongly  associated  with  democratic  backsliding. 
Nevertheless,  it  is  important  to  acknowledge  how  far-right  populist  parties 
exploit legitimate grievances which need to be recognised and addressed by 
democratic governments, including existing democratic deficits, current and 
future  demographic  pressures,  and  economic  hardship.  This  is  not  just  in 
order to protect democracy in the EU, but also in order to improve it; 

•  Notions  of  identity  and  democracy  are  reciprocal  in  that  a  thick 
understanding  of  democracy,  as  a  set  of  values,  is  underpinned  by  and 
requires  a  thick  understanding  of  identity:  as  a  sense  of  community  based 
on  shared  values  and  shared  institutions,  which  protect  and  enact  these 
values.  

Furthermore, the EGE calls for:  

• 

the  acknowledgment  that  European  identity  has  two  essential  dimensions. 
The  first  is  a  formal  identity,  legally  attributed  or  recognised,  and  certified 
by  a  public  document,  that  is  of  a  political,  legal  and  administrative  nature 
and  which  is  described  as  citizenship,  i.e.  a  set  of  rights  and  duties  arising 
from being a citizen of a Member State of the European Union. The second 
is a substantive identity, embodied in shared values and principles, such as 
respect for human rights, emerging through shared (historical) experiences, 
and  accompanied  by  a  feeling  of  togetherness,  a  sense  of  community,

• 

• 

• 

recognising that pluralism is at the heart of European identity. Each of these 
dimensions calls for specific but concurring actions; 

the strengthening of citizenship, which in turn requires a broader and more 
direct  involvement  of  citizens  in  governance  at  all  levels.  This  should  be 
done  by  harnessing  associative,  participatory  and  deliberative  democracy 
and  by  creating  mechanisms  and  channels  to  increase  the  possibilities  for 
citizens  to  effectively  intervene  in  public  policies  that  affect  them  and  their 
communities; 

the  acknowledgement  that  strengthening  a  common  sense  of  belonging 
requires a commitment to pluralism within the framework of human rights. 
A  plurality  of  views  and  perspectives  can  contribute  to  a  richer  and  more 
informed  public  debate  about  issues  that  matter,  and  to  more  resilient 
societies; 

an ongoing commitment to the values that reflect and respond to the history 
of Europe’s people. As such, these values need to form a core component of 
a  European  identity  and  the  basis  of  our  democracy,  and  they  need  to  be 
more integrated and revitalised both in EU initiatives and policies, and in the 
civic space.

RECOMMENDATIONS 

On this basis, the EGE recommends: 

1.  That  policy  makers  and  relevant  organisations  at  all  levels  apply  a 
substantive  understanding  of  democracy  and  support 
the 
substantive values, rights, and practices that underpin such a ‘thick’ 
democracy.  This  also  requires  education,  training,  information,  etc.  The 
EGE  calls  for  funding  to  be  made  available  for  ongoing  public  consultation 
and deliberation on the best ways of reaching these goals.  

2.  That  policy  makers  at  all  levels  commit  to  strong  and  sufficiently 
funded  public  infrastructures  (education,  health,  water,  energy,  public 
transport, security, culture and care). This is not only essential to ensure the 
wellbeing  of  people  and  communities,  particularly  in  the  face  of  the 
demographic  changes  that  our  societies  are  undergoing,  and  as  a  way  to 
earn  the  trust  of  citizens,  but  also  as  a  precondition  for  civic  and  political 
engagement – and thus for associative democracy. 

3.  As  noted  in  our  previous  Opinion  on  Democracy  in  the  Digital  Age,  that 
policy  makers  and  funders  at  EU  and  national  levels  fund  and  otherwise 
support  (non-commercial)  European  public  spaces,  including  the 
development and protection of deliberative platforms as well as digital social 
platforms that are in public ownership or under democratic control.  

4.  A  strong  focus  on  the  design,  support,  and  development  of 
intermediary  structures  in  democratic,  policy  and  administrative 
theory  and  practice  in  the  coming  years.  Democracy  does  not  only 
consist  of  periodic  and  free  elections,  but  also  of  lived  practice  in  between 
elections.  Associative  democracy  –  understood  as  the  self-organisation  of 
citizens  for  the  purpose  of  assessing,  identifying  and  solving  problems  at 
local  and  regional  levels  –  is  one  of  these  lived  practices.  It  represents  a 
developmental  form  of  democracy  in  which  people  not  only  address 
collective problems but also develop democratic skills, such as listening and 
deliberating in mutual respect. The EGE calls upon policy makers at all levels 
to  recognise  intermediary  structures,  such  as  forms  of  associative 
democracy,  as  an  essential  component  of  flourishing  democracies,  and  to 
actively  facilitate  and  protect  civic  associations.  These  associations  should 
be  involved  in  governance  throughout  the  EU,  and  decision  making  should 
be devolved to them or associate them, where this is meaningfully possible.  

5.  That  policy  makers  at  all  levels  should  recognise  how  much  democratic 
decision  making  can  take  place  at  the  mundane  level  of  the 
preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of laws and 
policies.  Public  administration  agencies  and  administrators  should  adhere 
to a strong administrative and civic ethos that is comfortable with working in 
open,  collaborative 
relationships  with  civic  associations.  Such  an 
administrative,  civic  ethos  could  be  formulated  at  the  European  level,  as  a 
guide to leadership and related training at the European, national and local 
levels.

6.  That  policy  makers  at  all  levels  take  seriously  the  interplay  between 
law  and  authoritarian  populism.  Authoritarian  populist  leaders'  use  of 
law, as a shield, a sword or both, is not new, but we should not assume that 
today’s  democracy-destroying  uses  of  law  are  identical  to  their  historical 
counterparts. The EGE calls for analysis of the ways in which law, including 
legal  processes,  are  at  risk  of  being  hollowed  out  and  repurposed  by 
authoritarian  populist  leaders,  and  equally  how  such  risks  can  be  managed 
and resisted, including through law itself.   

7.  Valuing and deepening collective memory, a memory of facts and values, as 
integral to substantive and pluralistic forms of democracy. Without collective 
memory,  our  democracies  are  easy  prey  for  various  forms  of  non-
democratic movements. We recommend that more be done, at all levels of 
society,  and  specifically  aimed  at  all  age  groups,  from  the  education  of 
school-aged  children  and  youth  upwards,  to  counteract  the  creation  and 
exploitation  of  false  memories  as  well  as  forgetting  what  should  not  be 
forgotten, e.g. the harms of rights-violating laws, policies, and practices and 
the  benefits  of  rights-respecting  ones.  The  EGE  calls  upon  the  European 
Union  and  Member  States  to  reinforce  mechanisms  that  secure  and 
support fact and value-based collective memory.  

8.  That  all  members  of  the  research  community  consider  the  potential 
contribution  of  their  work  to  strengthening  democracy,  in  Europe 
and  beyond.  Research  funders  can  encourage this  by  explicitly  inviting  an 
impact analysis at the research proposal and reporting stage, in analogy to 
considerations  funders  often  require  on  issues  such  as  equality  of 
opportunity  or  sustainability.  In  addition,  grant  schemes  focusing  on 
democracy  reaching  out  to  a  broad  range  of  disciplines  can  continue  to 
encourage 
interdisciplinary 
collaborations.

9.  That,  to  achieve  the  optimum  level  of  quality  of  life  for  all,  economic 
indicators  should  not  be  interpreted  dogmatically,  but  in  conjunction  with 
the  conditions  of  people's  real  lives,  particularly  those  of  the  most 
vulnerable  members  of  society.  This  may  require  the  creation  of  new 
in  a  more 
metrics  measuring 
comprehensive  sense.  The  EGE  further  considers  it  imperative  for  policy 
makers  to  create  the  conditions  for  the  smooth  integration  of 
migrants  into  the  European  economy  and  society.  In  this  context, 
solidarity measures must be taken between Member States, both to combat 
the  modern  slave  trade  and  to  ensure  a  balanced  settlement  of  migrants 
throughout the EU.

Recent years have seen a wave of far-right populism gaining momentum 
in many countries. In this Statement, the EGE analyses how this puts 
democracy at risk. It formulates a substantive understanding of 
democracy that does not limit it to elections, but makes real the values 
and rights it is based upon. 

The EGE further reflects on how understandings of identity that are not 
defined by exclusionary categories but encompass plurality can contribute 
to people’s appreciation of the European endeavour and strengthen their 
participation in society. It highlights the need for a reorientation of Europe 
to its social roots as key for countering the rise of authoritarianism. 

On this basis, the EGE proposes a series of recommendations for a 
democratic and vibrant European civic space.

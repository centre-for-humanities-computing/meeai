The following points aim to shed light on the cloning debate by giving information on
the scientific aspects of cloning and the ethical problems relating to them.

1.1 

1.2 

1.3 

Cloning  is  the  process  of  producing  “genetically  identical”  organisms.  It  may
involve division of a single embryo, in which case both the nuclear genes and the
small  number  of  mitochondrial  genes  would  be  “identical”,  or  it  may  involve
nuclear transfer, in which case only the nuclear genes would be “identical”. But
genes may be mutated or lost during the development of the individual: the gene
set  may  be  identical  but  it  is  unlikely  that  the  genes  themselves  would  ever  be
totally identical. In the present context, we use the term “genetically identical” to
mean “sharing the same nuclear gene set”.

It  is  inherent  in  the  process  of  sexual  reproduction  that  the  progeny  differ
genetically  from  one  another.  In  contrast,  asexual  reproduction  (cloning)
produces genetically identical progeny. This is a common  form  of  reproduction
in  plants,  both  in  nature  and  in  the  hands  of  plant  breeders  and  horticulturists.
Once  a  desired  combination  of  characteristics  has  been  achieved  asexual
reproduction  is  the  best  way  of  preserving  it.  Asexual  reproduction  is  also
common  among  some 
insects).  Asexual
reproduction  in  plants  and  invertebrates  usually  takes  place  by  budding  or
splitting.

invertebrate  animals 

(worms, 

The first successful cloning in vertebrate animals was reported in 1952, in frogs.
Nuclei  from  early  frog  embryos  were  transferred  to  unfertilised  frog  eggs  from
which the original nuclei had been removed. The resulting clones were not reared
beyond the tadpole stage. In the 1960s, clones of adult frogs were produced by
transfer  not  only  of  nuclei  from  early  embryos  but  also  of  nuclei  from
differentiated  larval  intestinal  cells.  Later,  clones  of  feeding  tadpoles  were
obtained  by  nuclear  transfer  from  differentiated  adult  cells,  establishing  that
differentiation of cells  involving  selective  gene  expression  does  not  require  the
loss  or  irreversible  inactivation  of  genes.  Nuclear  transfer  in  frogs  has  not  yet
generated an adult animal from cells of an adult animal.

1.4 

Nuclear transfer can be used for different objectives. Nuclear transfer in mice has
been  used  to  show  that  both  a  female  and  a  male  set  of  genes  are  required  for
development  to  birth.  If  the  two  pronuclei,  taken  from  fertilised  eggs  and
transferred  into  an  enucleated  egg,  are  only  maternal  or  only  paternal,  normal
development does not occur. This is not cloning, since the single embryo formed

1.6 

1.7 

1.8 

1.9 

is  not  identical  to  any  other  embryo  and  the  objective  is  not  to  multiply
individuals.

Nuclear  transfer  has  also  been  used  for  cloning  in  various  mammalian  species
(mice, rabbits, sheep, cattle), but until recently only nuclei taken from very early
embryos  were  effective,  and  development  was  often  abnormal,  for  reasons  that
are not fully understood.

In  contrast,  cloning  by  embryo  splitting,  from  the  2-cell  up  to  the  blastocyst
stage,  has  been  extensively  used  in  sheep  and  cattle  to  increase  the  yield  of
progeny from genetically high-grade parents. Because of the different pattern of
early  development,  embryo  splitting  is  much  less  successful  in  mice.  From  a
scientific  point  of  view,  it  would  probably  not  be  very  effective  in  the  human,
although monozygotic (one-egg) twins and higher multiples occur naturally at a
low incidence.

In 1996, a new method of cloning sheep embryos was reported, which involved
first  establishing  cell  cultures  from  single  embryos.  Nuclei  from  the  cultured
cells  were  transferred  to  enucleated  unfertilised  sheep  eggs,  particular  attention
being paid to the cell cycle stage of both donor and host cells, and the eggs were
then  artificially stimulated to develop. Genetically identical  normal  lambs  were
born.

Cell  cultures  were  then  established  not  only  from  embryonic  and  foetal  stages,
but  also  from  mammary  tissue  taken  from  a  6-year-old  sheep.  Nuclear  transfer
was  carried  out  as  before,  and  in  1997  it  was  reported  that  several  lambs  had
been  born  from  the  embryonic  and  foetal  transfers  and  one  lamb  named  Dolly
(out of 277 attempts) from the adult nuclear transfer. It is not known whether the
transferred nucleus was from a differentiated mammary gland cell or from a stem
cell.

From the point of view of basic research, this result is important. If repeatable it
may  allow  greater  insight  into  the  ageing  process,  how  much  is  due  to  cell
ageing,  and  whether  or  not  it  is  reversible.  Such  work  may  also  increase  our
understanding of cell commitment, the origin of the cancer process, and whether
it  can  be  reversed,  but  at  the  present  time  the  research  is  at  a  very  early  stage.
Dolly may have a shortened lifespan or a greater susceptibility to cancer: if she is
fertile,  her  progeny  may  show  an  increased  abnormality  rate,  owing  to  the
accumulation of somatic mutations and chromosomal damage.

CONCERNING THE APPLICATIONS OF ANIMAL CLONING

1.10  Potential uses of cloning animals are reported to include:

-  in  the  field  of  medicine  and  medical  research,  to  improve  genetic  and
physiological  knowledge,  to  make  models  for  human  diseases,  to  produce  at
lower cost proteins like milk proteins to be used for therapeutic aims, to provide
source of organs or tissues for xenotransplantation;

1.11 

- in agriculture and agronomical research, to improve the selection of animals or
to  reproduce  animals  having  specific  qualities  (longevity,  resistance,...)  either
innate, or acquired by transgenesis.

3

From  the  point  of  view  of  animal  breeding,  the  technology  could  be  useful,  in
particular  if  it  increases  the  medical  and  agricultural  benefits  expected  from
transgenesis  (genetic  modification  of  animals).  By  using  genetic  modification
and selection in cultured cell lines, rather than in adult animals, it could become
possible to remove genes, such as those provoking allergic reactions, as well as
adding genes, for the benefit of human health.

1.12  Furthermore,  transgenesis  is  an  uncertain  process:  different  transgenic  animals
express the introduced gene in a different manner and to a different extent, and
do  not  “breed  true”.  Cloning  of  adult  animals  of  high  performance,  if  it  is
possible,  would  reduce  the  number  of  transgenic  animals  needed  and  would
allow  human  pharmaceuticals  for  example  to  be  produced  at  a  lower  cost  than
would be possible otherwise.

1.13 

If the use of cloning  became more  widespread in the animal breeding  industry,
for  example  to  bring  the  level  of  the  general  herd  up  the  level  of  the  elite
breeding  populations, there  is  a  danger  that  the  level  of  genetic  diversity  could
fall  to  an  unacceptable  degree.  The  introduction  of  artificial  insemination  in
cattle raised similar problems.

CONCERNING HUMAN IMPLICATIONS

1.14  A  clear  distinction  must  be  drawn  between  reproductive  cloning  aimed  at  the
birth  of  identical  individuals,  which  in  humans  has  never  been  performed,  and
non-reproductive cloning, limited to the in-vitro phase.

1.15 

In  considering  human  implications,  we  must  again  distinguish  between  cloning
by embryo splitting and cloning by nuclear replacement (see Embryo splitting in
the human is the event that gives rise to monozygotic (one-egg) twins and higher
multiples.  It  has  been  discussed  in  the  context  of  assisted  reproduction,  as  a
means of increasing the success rate of IVF, but there is no evidence that it has
ever been used for this purpose, nor that it would be effective if it were so used,
because of the pattern of early development of the human embryo.

1.16  Monozygotic  twins  show  us  that  genetically  identical  individuals  are  far  from
identical:  they  may  differ  from  one  another  not  only  physically  but  also
psychologically,  and  in  terms  of  personality.  Individuals  cloned  by  nuclear
transfer  from  an  adult  cell  would  of  course  be  even  more  different  from  their
donor, since they would have different mitochondrial populations, they would be
different in age and they would have had a different environment both before and
after birth and a different upbringing. We are not just our genes.

4

1.17  There  is  no  ethical  objection  to  genetically  identical  human  beings  per  se
existing,  since  monozygotic  twins  are  not  discriminated  against.  However,  the
use  of  embryo  splitting,  or  the  use  of  human  embryo  cells  as  nuclear  donors,
deliberately to produce genetically identical human beings raises serious ethical
issues,  concerned  with  human  responsibility  and  instrumentalization,  of  human
beings.

1.18  However,  research  involving  human  nuclear  transfer  could  have  important
therapeutic  implications,  for  example  the  development  of  appropriate  stem  cell
cultures  for  repairing  human  organs.  It  could  also  provide  insights  into  how  to
induce  regeneration  of  damaged  human  tissues.  If  such  research  resulted  in
embryonic development, the serious and controversial ethical issues  concerning
human embryo research would of course arise. Any  attempt  to  develop  methods
of  human  reproductive  cloning  would  require  a  large  amount  of  human
experimentations.

1.19 

If  adult  cells  were  to  be  used  as  nuclear  donors,  we  are  still  ignorant  of  the
possible risks: whether the cloned individuals would  have a shorter life-span,  a
greater susceptibility to cancer, whether they would be fertile, and if so whether
they  or  their  offspring  would  suffer  from  an  abnormal  rate  of  genetic
abnormalities.  Furthermore,  the  procedure  would  be  immensely  costly:  each
attempt  would require  several  eggs  and  an  available  uterus,  and  many  attempts
would  be  unsuccessful.  The 
and
instrumentalization  of  human  beings  are  even  more  ethically  acute  in  this
context.

CONCERNING CLONING OF ANIMALS

2.1 

2.2 

Research  on  cloning  in  laboratory  and  farm  animals  is  likely  to  add  to  our
understanding of biological processes, in particular ageing and cell commitment,
and hence may contribute to human well-being. It is ethically only acceptable if
carried  out  with  strict  regard  to  animal  welfare,  under  the  supervision  of
licensing bodies.

Cloning of farm animals may prove to be of medical and agricultural as well as
economic benefit. It is acceptable only when the aims and methods are ethically
justified  and  when  it  is  carried  out  under  ethical  conditions,  as  outlined  in  the
GAEIB’s Opinion n° 7 on the Genetic Modification of Animals.

2.3 

These ethical conditions include:

-  the  duty  to  avoid  or  minimize  animal  suffering  since  unjustified  or  disproportionate
suffering is unacceptable;

- the duty of reducing, replacing and when possible refining the experimentation adopted
for the use of animals in research;

5

- the lack of better alternatives;

- human responsibility for animals, nature and the environment, including biodiversity.

2.4 

2.5 

Particular  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  need  to  preserve  genetic  diversity  in
farm  animal  stocks.  Strategies  to  incorporate  cloning  into  breeding  schemes
while maintaining diversity should be developed by European institutions.

In so far as cloning contributes to health, special attention should be paid to the
public’s  right  to  protection  against  risks  as  well  as  their  right  to  adequate
information.  Furthermore,  if  the  costs  of  production  are  reduced,  consumers
should also benefit.

CONCERNING HUMAN IMPLICATIONS

2.6 

As far as reproductive cloning is concerned, many motives have been proposed,
from  the  frankly  selfish  (the  elderly  millionaire  vainly  seeking  immortality)  to
the apparently acceptable (the couple seeking a replacement for a dead  child, or
a  fully  compatible  donor  for  a  dying  child,  or  the  attempt  to  perpetuate  some
extraordinary artistic or intellectual talent). Considerations of instrumentalization
and eugenics render any such acts ethically unacceptable. In addition, since these
techniques  entail  increased  potential  risks,  safety  considerations  constitute
another  ethical  objection.  In  the  light  of  these  considerations,  any  attempt  to
produce a genetically identical human individual by nuclear substitution from a
human adult or child cell (“reproductive cloning”) should be prohibited.

2.7 

The  ethical  objections  against  cloning  also  rule  out  any  attempt  to  make
genetically identical embryos for clinical use in  assisted reproduction,  either by
embryo  splitting  or  by  nuclear  transfer  from  an  existing  embryo,  however
understandable.

2.8  Multiple  cloning  is  D(cid:3) IRUWLRUL  unacceptable.  In  any  case,  its  demands  on  egg
donors and surrogate mothers would be outwith the realms of practicality at the
present time.

2.9 

Taking into account the serious ethical controversies surrounding human embryo
research:  for  those  countries  in  which  non-therapeutic  research  on  human
embryos  is  allowed  under  strict  licence,  a  research  project  involving  nuclear
substitution should have the objective either to throw light on the cause of human
disease  or  to  contribute  to  the  alleviation  of  suffering,  and  should  not  include
replacement of the manipulated embryo in a uterus

2.10  The  European  Community  should  clearly  express  its  condemnation  of  human
reproductive cloning and should take this into account in the relevant texts and
regulations  in  preparation  as  the  Decision  adopting  the  Vth  Framework
Programme  for  Research  and  Development  (1998-2002)  and  the  proposed
Directive on legal protection of biotechnological inventions.

GENERAL REMARKS

2.11  Further efforts must be made to inform the public, to improve public awareness
of  potential  risks  and  benefits  of  such  technologies,  and  to  foster  informed
opinion. The European Commission is invited to stimulate the debate involving
public, consumers, patients, environment and animal protection associations, and
a well structured public debate should be set up at European level. Universities
and High Schools should also be involved in the debate at European level.

2.12  These  new  technologies  increase  the  power  of  people  over  nature  and  thus
increase their responsibilities and duties. Along the line of the promotion by the
European Commission of research on the ethical, legal and social aspects of life
sciences, the Commission should continue to foster ethical research on cloning-
related areas, at a European level.

SUMMARY 

The European Group on Ethics of science and new technologies (EGE) has 

adopted its Opinion number 22 on June 20, 2007. The Opinion indicates the 

implementing  measures  (guidelines)  to  use  during  the  ethics  review  of  FP7 

research  projects  on  human  embryonic  stem  cells  (hESC),  as  requested  by 
the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso1, and in line with the 

adoption  of  the  EU’s  Seventh  Framework  Programme  for  research  and 

development (FP7). 

The  EGE  stressed  that,  as  is  the  case  in  the  European  Union,  there  are 

divergent  views  within  the  Group  on  the  moral  legitimacy  of  research  on 

human embryos and hESCs, ranging from objection to research involving the 

destruction of human embryos (which makes the full respect of dignity of the 

human  embryo  impossible),  to  a  position  allowing  hESC  research  under 

certain conditions or on a broader basis.  

The  Group,  however,  acknowledged  the  political  decision  taken  as  the 

starting  point  for  its  Recommendations,  but  emphasised  that  the  ethical 

dilemma  regarding  the  moral  status  of  the  human  embryo  and  its  use  in 

research  still  persists  both  within  the  EGE  members  and  the  EU.  Therefore, 

the Group did not elaborate ethical arguments on hESC research as such, but 

worked on Recommendations for FP7 ethics review of hESC projects. 

The  EGE  recognised  the  need  for  promoting  responsible  research  that  is 

transparent,  serves  the  public  interest,  respects  MS  autonomy,  preserves 

public  trust,  promotes  international  cooperation  and  requires  the  embedding 

1  Letter  sent  by  EC  President  Barroso  to  the  EGE  on  22/11/2006.  "I  would  like  to  invite  the  European 
Group  on  Ethics  to  provide  the  Commission  with  an  Opinion  on  the  implementing  measures  required 
during  the  ethics  review  of  research  projects  on  human  embryonic  stem  cells  that  will  assure  that  the 
ethical rules and requirements are fully met".

of ethics within research practice. The Group indicated that, in addition to the 

FP7 ethics rules already adopted in co-decision, among others the following 

considerations should apply to hESC funded by the EU: 

•  FP7 hESC lines have to result from non-implanted IVF embryos,  

• 

 If alternatives to hESCs with the same scientific potential as embryo-

derived  stem  cells  will  be  found  in  the  future,  their  use  should  be 

maximised,  

•  donors'  rights  (in  terms  of  health,  informed  consent,  data  protection 

and free donation) have to be protected and safeguarded.  

The EGE also stressed the following needs: 

•  To  maximise  the  use  of  hESC  banked  in  the  European  Registry  on 

hESC Research 

•  To  take  concrete  actions  to  stimulate  public  debate  on  this  research 

sector. 

In addition, the EGE  expressed the view that the use of human embryos to 

generate stem cells should be minimised as much as possible in the EU and 

indicated  a  number  of  issues  that  would  deserve  interdisciplinary  research 

and  further  discussions,  such  as,  inter  alia,  the  use  of  the  human  body  for 

modern  medicine,  including  commercialisation  of  products  and  procedures 

stemming  from  the  use  of  human  embryonic  stem  cells;  the  underlying 

anthropology of human embryonic stem cell research, especially in the light of 

hybrids  and  the  chimera  research  connected  to  stem  cell  research;  the 

correlation of human embryonic stem cell research and questions concerning 

regenerative  medicine,  health-related  justice,  including  the  issue  of  global 

justice;  the  relation  between  science  and  humanities  and  between  science 

and society with respect to the development of new technologies.  

4

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The EGE also indicated two topics that the Group may address in the future: 

(1)  the  patenting  hESC-derived  materials  and  (2)  the  tension  induced  by  a 

policy  that  encourages  both  free  donation  and  commercial  use  of  derivates 

from human substances. 

The Recommendations were adopted by unanimity and issued to the 

Commission on July 11, 2007.

II. WHEREAS 

II.1 Preamble 

It is common knowledge that opinions about the ethical legitimacy of research on 

human  embryos  are  sharply  divided.  The  controversy  is  rooted  in  different 

ethical, philosophical, and/or religious viewpoints, each of which is acknowledged 

to  be  fully  legitimate.  In  this  respect,  some  claim  that  the  divergences  are 

‘intrinsic’  and  therefore  irreconcilable,  while  others  claim  that  common  positions 

are achievable while respecting the pluralism of European societies, as practical 

solutions.  

The scope of these Recommendations, however, is not to address the ethics of 

human  embryonic  stem  cell  research  or  research  on  human  embryos.  These 

Recommendations  relate  to  the  political  decision  reached  by  the  European 

Institutions  on  the  EU’s  Seventh  Framework  Research  Programme  and  is 

intended to contribute to the implementation of the mechanism established under 

the  Programme  for  an  ethics  review  of  EU-funded  research  activities  involving 

the use of human embryonic stem cells. 

Because  of  the  particular  scope  of  these  Recommendations,  it  is  important  to 

identify  the  main  requirements  regarding  the  ethics  of  human  embryonic  stem 

cells  that  have  been  adopted  in  co-decision  by  the  European  Institutions 

involved:  the  Council  and  the  European  Parliament.  In  addition,  as  the  current 

EU FP follows on from the previous one, and since both implement the European 

Research Area (the policy strategy of the EU in research and development) and 

are linked to the economic strategy of the EU (the “Lisbon agenda”), the present 

document will refer to the previous EU FP and its implementation to date by the 

Commission services.

II.2  The  Sixth  Framework  Programme 

for  research, 

technological 

development  and  demonstration:  “Integrating  and  strengthening  the 

European Research Area” (2002-2006) – FP6 

On  30  September  2002, 

the  Council  adopted 

the  specific  programme 

implementing  the  Sixth  Framework  Programme  for  research,  technological 

development  and  demonstration:  “Integrating  and  strengthening  the  European 
Research Area” (2002-2006) (Decision 2002/834/EC30 — hereinafter referred to 

as “the specific programme”).  

The  specific  programme  allowed  the  funding  of  research  activities  involving  the 

use of human embryos and human embryonic stem cells except in three areas:  

– 

research  activity  aiming  at  human  cloning  for  reproductive  purposes 

(reproductive cloning),  

– 

research  activity  intended  to  modify  the  genetic  heritage  of  human  beings 
which could make such changes heritable (germline gene therapy)31, 

– 

research activities intended to create human embryos solely for the purpose 

of research or for the purpose of stem cell procurement, including by means 

of somatic cell nuclear transfer (commonly referred to as therapeutic cloning). 

On  adopting  the  programme,  however,  the  Council  indicated  that  “detailed 

implementing  provisions  concerning  research  activities  involving  the  use  of 

human  embryos  and  human  embryonic  stem  cells  shall  be  established  by  31 

December  2003”.  It  asked  the  Commission  to  1)  prepare  these  provisions,  2) 

prepare  a  working  paper  on  the  issue;  3)  organise  an  inter-institutional  seminar 

on bioethics.

A moratorium was then implemented by the Commission and no hESC research 

has since been funded with the exception of proposals for projects that involved 

the use of already banked or isolated human embryonic stem cells.  

The  Council  asked  the  Commission  to  publish  a  staff  report  on  scientific 

advances  and  needs  and  on  the  evolution  of  international  and  national 

legislation,  regulations  and  ethical  rules  regarding  research  involving  the  use  of 

human  embryonic  stem  cells.  The  report  was  prepared  by  the  Commission, 
published  on  3  April  2003  (SEC(2003)  44132),  and  then  transmitted  to  the 

European  Parliament  and  the  Council  as  a  basis  for  discussion  at  an  inter-
institutional seminar on bioethics organised by the Commission33.  

On 9 July 2003, the Commission then submitted to the Council a proposal for the 
modification  of  the  specific  programme  (COM(2003)  39034),  on  which  the 
European  Parliament  had  to  express  its  opinion35.  The  proposal  applied 

specifically to Community funding of research activities involving the procurement 

of  stem  cells  from  human  embryos  created  as  a  result  of  medically  assisted  in 

vitro fertilisation designed to induce pregnancy and no longer to be used for that 

purpose  (non-implanted  human  embryos);  and  it  was  based  on  the  principles 

established  by  the  European  Group  on  Ethics,  in  particular  the  fundamental 

ethical  principles  set  out  in  Opinion  No  15  “Ethical  aspects  of  human  stem  cell 
research  and  use”36.  This  Commission  proposal  received  a  favourable  Opinion 

from  the  European  Parliament  but  did  not  obtain  a  qualified  majority  at  the 

Council of 3 December 2003. 

32 http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/conferences/2003/bioethics/index_en.html. 
33 On 24 April 2003, the inter-institutional seminar on bioethics took place. The seminar addressed issues 
related to human embryonic stem cell research under the Sixth Framework Programme for research and 
provided an opportunity for discussion and exchanging of views between experts (scientific, legal, and 
in  ethics)  and  representatives  of  the  European  Parliament,  the  Council,  the  Commission,  the  Member 
States and the accession and candidate countries.

isolated  human  embryonic  stem  cells  in  culture  to  be  funded  under  Council 
Decision  2002/834/EC”37  were  approved  by 

the  Regulatory  Committee 

(comprising representatives of the Member States) on 25 June 2003 and by the 

Commission on 11 November 2003.  

On 31 December 2003, the moratorium ended and the two legal texts on which 

the  Commission  based  its  research  implementation  were:  1)  the  specific 

programme  implementing  the  Sixth  Framework  Programme  for  research, 

technological development and demonstration, “Integrating and strengthening the 
European  Research  Area”  (2002-2006)  (Decision  2002/834/EC)38,  and  2)  the 

“procedural modalities for research activities involving banked or isolated human 

embryonic stem cells in culture” (annexed to these Recommendations). 

II.3 Human Embryonic Stem Cell (hESC) projects financed under FP6 

In  total,  18  hESC  projects  were  financed  under  FP6  within  the  thematic  priority 

“Life  sciences,  genomics  and  biotechnology  for  health”.  These  18  projects 

accounted  for  less  than  3%  of  the  total  number  of  projects  funded  within  this 

thematic priority under FP6. Most FP6 hESC projects also involved research into 

adult stem cells and/or foetal stem cells (comparative approach), but one of the 

18 was entirely dedicated to human embryonic stem cell research (ESTOOLS). A 

detailed  list  of  FP6  projects  involving  the  use  of  hESCs  is  annexed  to  these 

Recommendations. 

II.4  The  ethics  provisions  applying  to  FP6-funded  human  embryonic  stem 
cell projects 

II.4.1 FP6 ethics review 
In  order  to  implement  Article  6  of  the  Framework  Programme  and  Article  15  of 

the Rules for Participation, the FP6 evaluation procedure included a check of the 

ethical  issues  raised  by  the  proposals.  Following  the  scientific  evaluation,  an

ethical review of the successful proposals involving sensitive ethical issues was 

carried out before the final selection by the Commission. 

The objective of the ethical review was to make sure that the European Union did 

not  support  research  contrary  to  fundamental  ethical  principles  and  to  examine 

whether  the  research  complied  with  the  rules  relating  to  ethics  set  out  in  the 

Decisions on the Sixth Framework Programme and Specific Programmes.  

Breakdown of projects subjected to ethical review, by research area 

The ethical review was carried out by external experts with the expertise needed 

for  an  ethical  assessment  of  the  proposals  (interdisciplinary  approach).  The 

experts  were  different  each  time  and  were  selected  by  the  Commission  on  the 

basis of expertise, geographical balance and gender balance.  

The  total  number  of  FP6  proposals  that  underwent  an  ethical  review  was  885 

(11% of FP6 research projects), whereby 18 involved human embryonic stem cell 

research (around 2% of the total number of ethically reviewed proposals).

II.4.2 Ethics provisions for FP6 hESC projects 

For  human  embryonic  stem  cell  projects  funded  under  FP6,  the  following 

provisions applied: 

a)  During  the  scientific  evaluation,  independent  experts  assessed  the  need  to 
use hESCs to achieve the scientific objectives set forth in the proposal39. 

b)  An ethical review was organised by the Commission with independent experts 

on  a  case-by-case  basis.  It  was  based  on  the  ethical  rules  embodied  in  the 

European  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  and  in  the  different  national,  EU 

and  international  regulations  or  conventions,  also  taking  into  account  the 
Opinions  of  the  European  Group  on  Ethics40.  In  particular,  four  different 

criteria were assessed: 

•  whether  the  applicants  took  into  account  the  legislation,  regulations, 

ethical  rules  and/or  codes  of  conduct  in  place  in  the  country  where  the 

39  The type of stem cells to be used is chosen by the scientists in view of the objectives of the proposal, 
which  should  relate  to  fundamental  research  questions  or  medical  applications.  Then,  independent 
experts evaluate the proposal to assess the appropriateness of the approach chosen by the scientists.

research  using  banked  or  isolated  hESC  in  culture  was  to  take  place, 
including the procedures for obtaining informed consent41; 

• 

the source of the banked or isolated hESCs in culture;  

• 

the measures taken to protect personal data, including genetic data, and 

privacy; 

• 

the nature of financial inducements, if any. 

c)  A  positive  opinion  from  a  Regulatory  Committee  comprising  Member  State 

representatives was required.  

d)  Finally,  the  Commission  checked  that  the  participants  in  research  projects 

had received the approval of the relevant national or local ethics committees 

prior to the start of research activities. 

All these conditions were cumulative. 

In conclusion, each hESC research proposal supported under FP6 was assessed 

by at least two independent ethical reviews: one at national level (in the country 
where the research was to be carried out)42 and one at EU level.  

II.5  The  Seventh  Framework  Programme  for  research,  technological 
development and demonstration (2007-2013) – FP7 

As  with  FP6,  ethics  and  hESCs  played  a  major  role  in  the  inter-institutional 
debate  on  the  7th  FP,  this  intended  to  contribute  to  the  implementation  of  the 

41  The  EU  has  never  required  a  uniform  regulatory  system  for  all  fields  of  science  and  technology.  The 
Treaty  itself  guarantees  the  autonomy  of  the  Member  States.  As  a  consequence,  diverse  regulatory 
frameworks co-exist (e.g. for research on non-human primates, nuclear research, security and prevention 
of  terrorism,  bio-banking,  etc.).  The  principle  of  subsidiarity  is  respected  in  full,  assuming  respect  of 
fundamental ethical principles. 

42 If the research raising ethical issues is performed in more than one country (i.e. n countries), this implies 

that more than two ethical reviews will be performed (i.e. in fact n+1 ethical reviews).

Lisbon agenda and benefited of a budget of € 53 billion for the time frame 2007-
201343. 

The Commission proposal for FP7 was adopted on 6 April 2005. As for FP6, the 

proposal  had  a  specific  Article  (Article  6)  stating  that  “All  the  research 

activities…shall be carried out in compliance with fundamental ethical principles”. 

The  specific  programme  for  FP7  was  adopted  by  the  Commission  on  21 

September 2005. The Commission proposal was then transmitted to the relevant 

Institutions  (the  European  Parliament  and  the  Council)  for  their  approval  by  co-

decision.  

The  Parliament  adopted  (first  reading)  the  proposed  Programme  on  15  June 

2006  after  a  preceding  vote  and  a  request  for  amendments  by  the  relevant 

Parliamentary  Commission  (ITRE)  on  30  May  2005.  The  Commission  accepted 

the  Parliament’s  request  to  have  the  ethics  framework  incorporated  in  the 

Framework  Programme  text,  which  required  a  co-decision  by  the  European 

Parliament and the Council on this issue. This was not the case for FP6, where 

the  ethical  framework  was  included  in  the  specific  programme  adopted  by  the 

Council alone. 

After intense discussions, the programme was adopted by the Council on 24 July 

2006  (qualified  majority).  The  Council  agreement  was  based  on  a  Commission 

Declaration stating that “The European Commission will continue with the current 

practice  and  will  not  submit  to  the  Regulatory  Committee  proposals  for  projects 

which include research activities which destroy human embryos, including for the 

procurement of stem cells. The exclusion of funding of this step of research will 

not prevent Community funding of subsequent steps involving human embryonic 

stem cells”. 

43  A  detailed  description  of  the  inter-institutional  adoption  of  the  Programme  can  be  found  at

the  European  Parliament  plenary  session  (second  reading)  on  30  November 

2006 and adopted in co-decision on 18 December 2006. 

II.6  Ethics  provisions  under  FP7:  hESC  research  funded  by  the  European 
Union 

The  Council  agreement  made  the  eligibility  of  hESC  research  for  EU  funding 

subject to the same specific restrictions and conditions as with FP6. 

To  ensure  an  optimal  ethics  review  system,  the  President  of  the  European 

Commission  asked  the  EGE  on  November  2006  to  issue  an  Opinion  on  the 

ethics review of hESC projects funded under FP7: 

‘I would like to invite  the European Group on Ethics to provide the Commission 

with an Opinion on the implementing measures required during the ethics review 

of  research  projects  on  human  embryonic  stem  cells  that  will  assure  that  the 

ethical  rules  and  requirements  are  fully  met.  Such  an  Opinion  would  provide 

guidance (in relation to the values and principles to apply) for the Ethics Review 

within  the  frame  of  the  Programme  approved  by  the  Council  and  the  European 

Parliament. It would be important that this Opinion is available for use when the 
first FP7 projects involving human embryonic stem cells are evaluated.’44

III.  BACKGROUND FOR THE ETHICAL REVIEW OF HESC PROJECTS 

III.1 Existing ethical guidelines: a brief historical overview 

In  a  fast-developing  area  such  as  stem  cell  research,  ethical  requirements  are 

assuming increasing importance in project assessment. The process of research 

approval  includes  a  review  of  projects  by  a  panel  of  independent  experts  (both 

scientific and ethical).  

Up  to  the  present,  no  clinical  research  making  use  of  human  embryonic  stem 

cells has been carried out. In view of the long-term perspective of FP7, however, 

all ethical guidelines and regulations must be applied to FP-7 projects whenever 

they involve research on human subjects.  

Guidelines  and  regulations  governing  the  participation  of  human  subjects  in 

biomedical  research  have  been  established  at  international  level  for  many 

decades.  These  principles  are  laid  down  in  internationally  recognised  research 

ethics  guidelines  and  other  instruments,  including  (to  cite  only  the  most 
important): the Nuremburg Code of 194745, the Declaration of Helsinki of 196446 
(plus  amendments),  the  Belmont  Report  of  197947,  the  Convention  for  the 

Protection  of  Human  Rights  and  Dignity  of  the  Human  Being  with  regard  to  the 
Application of Biology and Medicine of 1997 (the “Oviedo Convention")48 and the 
additional protocols to the Convention49, the UNESCO Universal Declaration on 
the  human  genome  and  Human  Rights50  of  1997  and  International  Declaration 
on Human Genetic Data51of 2003, the Council for International Organisations of 

Medical  Sciences  (CIOMS)  International  Ethical  Guidelines  for  Biomedical

Research  Involving  Human  Subjects  of  200252,  and  the  UNESCO  Universal 
Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights of 200553.  

Over  the  last  few  years,  several  international  bodies  have  been  established 

across the world, which give information and guidance in the process of research 

proposal preparation, application, and definition of standards, both scientific and 

ethically sound.  

As noted before, the volume of documents addressing the ethics of hESC is vast 

and  diverse.  Additional  information  on  relevant  initiatives  in  this  area  may  be 

found,  for  example,  on  the  following  websites:  the  BioCentre  for  Bioethics  and 
Public  Policy  (CBPP)54,  CARE  for  Europe55,  the  International  Society  for  Stem 
Cell  Research56,  and  the  Nuffield  Council  on  Bioethics57,  along  with  those  of 
various national institutions58,59 and international organisations60,61. 

Additionally  to  the  above  mentioned  ethics  guidelines  produced  by  relevant 

International  Organisations,  in  2006  the  International  Society  for  Stem  Cell 

Research  has  published  specific  guidelines  on  hESC  (Guidelines  of  the 

International Society for Stem Cell Research  (ISSCR). 

The  Guidelines  address  the  procurement,  derivation,  banking,  distribution,  and 

use  of  cells  and  tissues  taken  from  pre-implantation  stages  of  human

development;  to  procurements  of  gametes  and  somatic  tissues  for  stem  cell 
research; and to the use of human stem cell lines62.  

III.2 Research using Human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC) 

Human  embryonic  stem  cells  are  used  in  a  variety  of  research  projects  with 

different  scientific  goals.  Some  research  protocols  focus  completely  on  hESCs, 

but  sometimes  they  may  use  human  embryonic  and  adult  stem  cells  for 

comparative  purposes  or  may  use  hESCs  as  a  tool  to  obtain  other  scientific 

outcomes (for example to make in vitro tests  of a given experimental drug or a 

new chemical).  

The relevance and use of hESCs therefore varies considerably according to the 

expected  scientific  outcomes  of  the  research  trials.  The  scientific  community  is 

interested in investigating the basic physiology of stem cells, their potential and 

characteristics.  One  important  aspect  of  such  research  is  the  comparative 

analysis of hESCs and other types of stem cells, such as umbilical-cord and adult 

tissue-specific  stem  cells,  in  order  to  address  specific  questions  concerning  the 

suitability  of  these  types  of  cells.  Stem  cell  research  is  also  done  to  explore  its 

potential use for regenerative medicine (degenerative diseases such as diabetes 

and  Parkinson’s  disease)  and  gene  therapy  (e.g.  for  cystic  fibrosis  and 

Huntington’s disease). At present, there are no indications that clinical trials will 

be carried out in the near future.  

In addition, researchers are exploring the potential use of hESCs in toxicological 

studies  in  order  to  replace  animal  models  with  in  vitro  models.  Other  uses  of 

hESCs,  with  the  exception  of  the  project  ESTOOL  (see  annex  to  this  Opinion), 

are  in  large  multidisciplinary  studies,  such  as  those  involving  genomics  and 

62 http://www.isscr.org/guidelines/ISSCRhESCguidelines2006.pdf 

24

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
proteomics  approaches,  which  focus  on  broader  contexts  with  only  a  subset  of 

experiments specifically dealing with hESCs. 

Examples of EU-funded projects that make different uses of hESCs: 

1)  EUROSTEMCELL:  Project  aiming  to  compare  adult,  foetal,  embryonic  and 
tissue-specific stem cells (see http://www.eurostemcell.org/); 

2)  BETACELL  THERAPY:  Project  aiming  to  study  the  generation  of  insulin-
producing  pancreatic  beta  cells 
(see 
for 
http://www.betacelltherapy.org); 

treatment  of  diabetes 

the 

3)  CARCINOGENOMICS:  Project  aiming  to  carry  out  in  vitro  testing  to  assess 
the  genotoxic  and  carcinogenomic  properties  of  chemical  compounds  (in  silico 
models  to  evaluate  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  a  compound  in  vivo)  (see 
http://www.ecopa.eu/doc/CarcinogenomicsPressRelease-201106.pdf). 

III.3 Sources of human embryonic stem cells  

The  most  common  source  of  tissue  for  human  embryonic  stem  cell  isolation  is 

the  inner  cell  mass  (ICM)  of  embryos  created  using  assisted  reproduction 

technologies  (ART),  but  not  transferred  to  the  woman’s  uterus,  either  because 

the number of embryos exceeds the number allowed to be transferred under the 

law  (usually  2  or  3)  or  because  of  genetic  defects  detected  by  pre-implantation 
genetic diagnostics (PGD)63. In the same way, embryos as a source of stem cells 

can  be  created  solely  for  research  purposes  via  in  vitro  fertilization  (IVF),  but 
outside the ART context64. 

Another  source  of  human  embryonic  stem  cells,  which  is  allowed  in  only  a  few 
countries65,  is  their  creation  by  means  of  somatic  nuclear  cell  transfer  (SCNT), 

where  a  somatic  cell  is  taken  from  an  adult  patient  and  its  nucleus  transferred 

into  a  donated  enucleated  oocyte.  Unlike  hESCs  derived  from  a  donated  IVF 

63 This practice is not permitted in all EU Member States.  
64 This practise is not permitted in most EU Member States. See Table1, p.29. 
65 In the EU, therapeutic cloning is allowed only in the following countries: Belgium, Spain, Sweden and 
UK.  

25

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
embryo, the resulting cell line using SCNT is genetically identical to the donor of 

the nucleus. 

Another possible way of creating stem cells by means of SCNT, but not leading 

to therapeutic cloning, is to create human/animal hybrids by mixing a human cell 
with an animal egg in order to obtain ‘humanised’ stem cells66. There is currently 

debate  on  the  ethics  of  human/animal  hybrids  in  several  EU  and  non-EU 

countries. The EC is at present financing a project on the ethical, legal and social 
implications of human/animal hybrids67.  

III.4 Derivation of new hESC lines 

As indicated in section II.2, the derivation  of new toti-potent cells or pluri-potent 

stem cell lines from donated pre-implantation human embryos or embryonic cells, 

or  via  nuclear  reprogramming,  is  not  funded  by  the  EU  Research  Programme. 

The derivation of new hESCs necessarily involves the procurement of biological 

material from human subjects, which then (when allowed) needs to be approved 

by  institutional  oversight  bodies  with  specific  responsibility  for  the  protection  of 

human subjects.  

66 Recently, British scientists have been seeking the HFEA approval to create rabbit-human stem cells by 
using  rabbits'  oocytes,  in  order  to  overcome  the  shortage  of  egg  donors  in  the  UK,  in  a  collaboration 
between King's College in London and the Edinburgh University.

III.5 Alternatives to hESC research  

As  stated  in  section  II.2,  the  justification  for  the  use  of  human  embryonic  stem 

cells  under  FP7  is  to  be  assessed  during  the  scientific  evaluation  of  research 

proposals.  EU  projects  can  be  funded  only  if  no  suitable  alternatives  to  human 

embryonic  stem  cells  can  be  found  and  the  absolute  necessity  of  using  hESCs 

has  been  scientifically 

justified  and  evaluated.  With  regard 

to  possible 

alternatives  to  hESCs,  the  first  factor  to  consider  is  the  possible  use  of  adult 

human stem cells. 

Adult stem cells are multi-potent stem cells, suitable for the treatment of human 

diseases  such  as  leukaemia,  lymphomas  and  other  blood  diseases.  Such 

therapies 

rely  on 

the  very  well-established  practice  of 

transplanting 

hematopoietic  stem  cells  (blood-forming  stem  cells)  present  in  bone  marrow, 

placenta  or  umbilical-cord  blood  cells.  Other  diseases  that  may  be  cured  in  the 

near future by using adult stem cells are, for example, diabetes and some forms 

of  cancer  (e.g.  kidney),  for  which  the  clinical  potential  of  adult  stem  cells  looks 

very promising.  
Given  the  nature  of  embryonic  stem  cells  and  the  moral  dilemma  regarding  the 

destruction of human embryos to obtain embryonic stem cells, research has also 

been  focussing  on  alternative  sources  of  human  embryonic  stem  cells,  an 

endeavour which received criticisms, both scientific and ethical, as in the case of 
altered nuclear transfer68, which was developed by scientists as a technological 
solution to the destruction of human embryos and the related ethical issues69,70, 

but 

implies  an  epigenetic  alteration  of 

the  egg 

to  preclude  natural 

embryogenesis. 

Nevertheless, some recent promising research into alternatives to hESCs has 

been carried out, such as for:

•  Non-embryonal sources of “embryonic like”, multipotent human stem cells 
(from human umbilical cord blood75 or from human amniotic fluid76).  

III.6 European Registry of existing hESC lines 

According  to  the  available  data,  81  different  hESC  lines  have  at  present  been 

established and are used in EU-funded projects. Since there is certain variability 

from  cell  line  to  cell  line,  the  Commission  has  felt  it  important  (1)  to  gather  in  a 

centralised  manner  all  information  available  on  each  single  cell  line  for 

comparative  purposes,  (2)  to  render  such  information  available  at  international 

level. 

The  European  Commission  has  therefore  decided  to  establish  and  fund  a 
European  registry  for  human  embryonic  stem  cell  lines77  in  order  to  help 

researchers  to  optimise  the  hESC  resources  available,  avoid  duplication  of  work 

and/or  the  creation  of  new  cell  lines  where  possible.  This  registry  is  expected  to 

boost the coordination and rationalisation of human embryonic stem cell research

coordinated by two institutions: the Centre of Regenerative Medicine (CRMB) in Barcelona, Spain, and 
the Berlin-Brandenburg Centre for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT) in Berlin, Germany.

in Europe. It will provide a platform to maximise reproducibility, comparability and 
transparency in the field78. 

The main objective of this initiative is to provide comprehensive information about 

all human embryonic stem cell lines available in Europe. The information will be 

gathered  together  on  a  publicly  accessible  internet  site  containing  data  on  the 

cell lines (e.g. cell characteristics) and their use (e.g. research project outcomes, 

clinical trials etc.). The registry will provide information on the sources of the stem 

cell lines and include comprehensive information on human embryonic stem cell 

lines  obtained  from  ongoing  and  future  EU-funded  projects.  The  data  will  be 

regularly updated and made accessible to the public.  

A Steering Committee comprising representatives of the leading European public 

institutions  involved  in  human  embryonic  stem  cell  research  has  also  been 

established. The Committee will be assisted by an Advisory Board comprising 17 

top  scientists  from  Europe  and  outside  Europe  in  the  field  of  human  embryonic 

stem  cell  research  and  an  independent  Ethics  Advisory  Board  to  ensure 

compliance with ethical requirements and ethical guidance.  

III.7 EU Member States regulations on hESC research 

Among the EU27, several clusters of countries can be identified according to how 

they regulate hESC research. However, all countries apply at least some 

regulations and/or procedural rules to specific projects involving hESC. Where 

hESC research is allowed, projects proposals have to undergo strict evaluation 

criteria, both scientific and ethical, decided upon by the competent national 
bodies79.  

78  For more information see: www.cmrb.eu; www.cellnet.org; 

www.ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/index_en.cfm?p=1_stem_projects.

Permissive position 

A few EU Member States have specific legislation for hESC research, covering 
the procurement of stem cells and their use for research. In Belgium, Spain80, 

Sweden and the UK, for example, embryo creation is allowed for research 

purposes.  

Permissive position with restrictions 

In  other  EU  Member  States  such  as  the  Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Finland, 
France,  Greece,  Netherlands  and  Portugal81,  regulations  allow  the  derivation  of 

new hESCs from embryos created as a result of assisted reproduction technology 

(ART)  and  in  vitro  fertilisation  to  induce  pregnancy,  but  only  when  they  can  no 

longer to be used for that purpose.  

Restrictive position 

Germany  and  Italy  have  stricter  hESC  research  regulations.  Scientists  in  these 

countries  cannot  derive  new  hES  cell  lines,  but  can  import  them.  In  Germany,  a 

new  discussion  has  arisen  as  to  whether  the  2002  Stem  Cell  Act  regulating  the 

importation  of  hESC  lines  should  be  revised,  but  no  legal  proposal  has  been 

forthcoming by the date of these Recommendations. The Italian legislation covers 

Artificial  Reproduction  Technology  and  the  production  of  new  hESC  (research 

involving  the  destruction  of  embryo  is  not  allowed).  Italy  has  therefore  no  legal 

provision as regards the use of imported hESC or existing hESC. 

No specific legislation or indirect legislation only 

In many Member States, hESC research has still no specific legislation (Bulgaria, 

Cyprus, Estonia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Latvia and Romania). Ireland, for instance, 

80 A new law in Spain has just been voted for. 
81 A new regulation is under way in Portugal.

currently  has  no  specific  legislation  dealing  with  embryonic  stem  cell  research 

and furthermore does not have a legislative basis for the practice of IVF. 

Some  other  EU  Member  States  have  no  ‘specific’  regulation  on  hESC  research, 

but  explicitly  indicated  that  they  are  against  it  (Austria,  Lithuania,  Malta,  Poland 

and  Slovakia)  by  voting  against  hESC  research  during  the  Council  decision  for 

FP7. 

Lastly, in some countries hESC is at present regulated only by indirect legislation 

for embryo research (Hungary, Slovenia), but without specific reference to hESC. 

The  table  below  summarises  the  current  regulatory  systems  in  the  EU27,  but 

specific  information  on  the  position  of  each  Member  State  can  be  found  in  the 

annex to these Recommendations (Regulatory Issues).

European  Commission83)  and  academic  level.  At  present,  there  is  no  EU 

consensus  on  the  moral  status  of  embryo  and  its  products  and,  reflecting  this 

wide diversity of moral cultures, there are different policies for patenting among 

national patent offices. The European Group on Ethics (EGE) has evaluated the 
ethical aspects of patenting inventions involving human stem cells84.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS  

IV.1 Preamble 

These  recommendations  constitute  the  reply  to  the  request  from  the 
President  of  the  European  Commission,  Mr  Barroso85,  after  the  adoption  of 
the  EU’s  Seventh  Framework  Programme  for  research  and  development 
(FP7), to elaborate an Opinion on the implementing measures required during 
the ethics review of research projects on human embryonic stem cells.  

As  is  the  case  in  the  European  Union,  there  are  divergent  views  within  the 
EGE  on  the  moral  legitimacy  of  research  on  human  embryos  and  hESCs, 
ranging  from  objection  to  research  involving  the  destruction  of  human 
embryos  (which  makes  the  full  respect  of  dignity  of  the  human  embryo 
impossible), to a position allowing hESC research under certain conditions or 
on a broader basis.  

The Group acknowledges the political decision taken as the starting point for 
its Recommendations, but emphasises that the ethical dilemma regarding the 
moral status of the human embryo and its use in research still persists. The 
EGE  therefore  stresses  that  the  ethical  differences  of  opinion  concerning 
hESC research have not been resolved. 

However,  these  recommendations  do  not  elaborate  ethical  arguments  on 
hESC  research  as  such;  this  is  because  this  was  not  the  task  given  to  the 
Group by the European Commission.  

85  Letter  sent  by  EC  President  Barroso  to  the  EGE  on  22/11/2006.  "I  would  like  to  invite  the  European 
Group  on  Ethics  to  provide  the  Commission  with  an  Opinion  on  the  implementing  measures  required 
during  the  ethics  review  of  research  projects  on  human  embryonic  stem  cells  that  will  assure  that  the 
ethical rules and requirements are fully met".

IV.2  Recommendations  for  the  ethical  review  of  research 
projects involving hESCs 

FP7 research projects involving the use  of hESCs are subject to stringent rules 

for  selection,  are  scrutinised  at  both  national  and  EU  level,  and  undergo  both 

scientific and ethical reviews. 

Under  the  FP7,  research  proposals  must  include  information  about  ethical 

aspects of the proposed research, explain in detail the project design and show 

that the proposal meets the national legal and ethical requirements of the country 

where the research is performed. 

After successfully passing the scientific evaluation, the selected hESC proposals 

undergo  a  specific  ethics  review  organised  by  the  Commission  on  a  case-by-

case  basis.  The  objective  of  the  review  is  to  ensure  that  the  European  Union 

does  not  support  research  that  would  not  comply  with  fundamental  ethical 
principles86 and to examine whether the ethics rules set out in FP7 are met.  

The  ethics  review  panel  is  a  transnational  body  composed  of  experts  from 

different disciplines. The panel produces an ethical review report, which lists the 

different  ethical  issues,  describes  the  way  these  issues  were  handled  by 

applicants and gives the recommendations of the panel.  

After having successfully passed both the scientific and ethics review, proposals 

for hESC projects are then handed over to a Regulatory Committee composed of 

EU Member States representatives, which decides upon the projects on a case-

by-case basis.  

86 Seventh Framework Programme (Decision No 1982/2006/EC), Article 6(1): ”All the research activities 
carried  out  under  the  Seventh  Framework  Programme  shall  be  carried  out  in  compliance  with 
fundamental ethical principles.“; Rules for Participation, Article 10: ”A proposal […] which contravenes 
fundamental  ethical  principles  […]  shall  not  be  selected.  Such  a  proposal  may  be  excluded  from  the 
evaluation and selection procedures at any time.”  

35

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
In  order  to  provide  guidance  to  the  members  of  the  FP7  hESC  ethics  review 

panels who will be asked to review the research projects using hESC lines, and 

under the specific remit and conditions laid down by the political decision of the 

European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  FP7,  and  also  by  the  specific 

request  of  the  President  of  the  European  Commission,  Mr.  J.  M.  Barroso  (see 

above), the EGE elaborated the following guidelines and points to consider when 
conducting such ethics review of FP7 projects87.  

IV.2.1 General criteria 

The European Commission has stated that it “will support actions and initiatives 

that  contribute  to  coordination  and  rationalisation  of  hESC  research  within  a 
responsible ethical approach”88. In line with this statement, the EGE recognises 

the  need  to  promote  responsible  research  that  is  transparent,  serves  the  public 

interest,  respects  Member  States'  autonomy,  preserves  public  trust,  promotes 

international  cooperation  and  requires  the  embedding  of  ethics  within  research 
practice89. 

Ethically  responsible  research  involving  human  embryonic  stem  cells  must 

comply  with  fundamental  ethical  principles  and  human  rights  in  the  European 
Union,90  from  the  procurement  of  stem  cells91  to  clinical  research  based  on 

hESCs.  

87  According  to  FP7  rules,  evaluators  sign  a  conflict  of  interest  declaration  and  EC  staff  verify  conflicts 
with each proposal they evaluate. Evaluation panels of ethics and scientific reviews are anonymous. 
88 Declaration of the European Commission on 24 July 2006 during the meeting of the Council of Ministers 

regarding FP7. See OJ L412/43, 30 December 2006. 

89 For example the Council of Europe Oviedo Convention,  (Art. 2).  
90 For details, see section I of this Opinion referring to the pertinent documents relevant to the context of 

medical research. 

91 FP7 excludes the procurement of hESCs from Community funding (see paragraph II.2).See Decision No 
1982/2006/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  18  December  2006  concerning  the 
Seventh  Framework Programme  of  the  European  Community  for research,  technological  development 
and demonstration activities (2007-2013), OJ L412, pp. 1-41, 30 December 2006.

The  fundamental  rights  include:  protection  rights  such  as  protection  of  human 

life, respect of its integrity, protection of health and freedom, political rights such 

as freedom from undue state intervention or participatory rights in political affairs, 

and  positive  rights  such  as  basic  social  and  economic  rights  insofar  as  these 

contribute  to  health  and  a  threshold  of  development,  resulting  in  health-related 
governance.92  

The balancing of these three groups of fundamental rights is by no means easy 

or  pre-determined.  Rather,  it  involves  ongoing  efforts  to  ensure  their  protection, 

granting and promotion of human dignity and human rights and, more concretely, 

it involves priority setting with respect to health-related research.  

General  criteria  for  research  incentives  in  specific  areas  incorporate  this 

balancing. They can be summarised as follows:  

•  scientific necessity and high-ranking status of the research93 
•  urgency 94 and   

•  social desirability,  

•  primacy of the interest and welfare of the human being over the sole 

interest of society or science. 

Social  desirability  is  open  to  political  and  societal  discourse  on  the  goals  and 
perspectives of the European Union in the 21st century, in particular the relation 

between economic growth and social goals, such as the promotion of healthcare 

standards  and  their  sustainable  application  at  national,  international  and  global 

level.  

As  far  as  hESC  research  is  concerned,  there  is  no  consensus  on  its  social 

acceptability  in  the  European  Union,  and  divergent  views  co-exist.  A  debate  on 

92 Cf. the United Nations’ Millennium Goals, which the European Union has committed itself to achieving.

the  best  model  (e.g.  “minimal  consensus”  or  “subsidiarity”  model)  to  regulate 

hESC research at EU level is therefore taking place within and across several EU 

Member States. 

Where morally sensitive means are to be used to achieve well-accepted goals — 

as in the case of human embryonic stem cells –— where not the goal of therapy-

oriented  research  is  questioned  but  the  means  to  accomplish  it,  the  EGE  holds 

that  additional  criteria  apply  concerning  the  necessity  of  the  research:  1)  non-

availability  of  validated  alternatives  and  (2)  the  non-redundancy  of  FP7 
projects95. 

However,  all  the  above  criteria,  which  constitute  the  key  scientific  evaluation 

criteria, need to be assessed from an ethical perspective during the ethics review 

process.  It  is  clear  that  the  ethics  review  cannot  and  should  not  duplicate  the 

scientific evaluation, which remains the main assessment of the scientific quality 

of  the  project  proposals.  Nevertheless,  the  two  reviews  are  complementary.  As 

far as FP7 hESC projects are concerned, the Commission should ensure that the 

scientific evaluation report is available to the ethics review panel and that there is 

effective communication between the two panels if needed. 

To  ensure  the  complementarity  of  the  two  reviews,  the  scientific  review  report 

should address at least the following points: 

•  Applicants  must  have  shown  that  research  with  human  stem  cells 

derived  from  alternative  sources,  such  as  adult  stem  cells,  amniotic 

fluid,  umbilical  cord  blood  or  other  relevant  ones  cannot  achieve  the 

expected  goals  of  the  project.  This  does  not  apply  to  research

sources;

•  Applicants must have documented the fact that, in accordance with the 

basic  ethical  principles  of  medical  research,  relevant  research  on 

animals and on cell lines of other origin (animal and human) has been 

adequately carried out before hESC research is performed;  

•  Applicants  must  show  that  their  research  is  aimed  at  future  human 

health  benefit  or  bio-medical  knowledge,  and  cannot  be  achieved  by 

alternatives.  This  includes  basic  research  using  hESCs,  which  is 

allowed in FP7. 

•  Applicants  must  have  demonstrated  that  no  alternatives  can  achieve 

the goals of the project. Although the Group is aware of the importance 

of  respecting  animal  welfare,  it  is  concerned  that  respect  for  human 

dignity may not be maintained when hESCs are used in toxicity testing 

of  industrial  or  other  commercially  produced  chemicals  not  related  to 

drugs,  such  as  cosmetics,  or  for  replacement  of  animal  testing. 

Therefore, particular attention is to be drawn to this issue (see below, 

paragraph IV.3, point 2);   

•  Applicants  must  provide  extensive  scientific  justification  when  their 

projects involve toxicity drug testing; this justification should make clear 

what sort of additional information is expected from the use of hESCs 

as compared to the established tests.  

The  scientific  panel  should  ensure  that  researchers  of  hESC  FP7  projects 

collaborate  nationally  and  internationally  in  order  to  minimise  the  use  of  hESCs 

within  FP7  funded  projects  and  to  achieve  complementary  synergy  rather  than 

competition. 

95  However,  repetitions  are  sometimes  necessary  to  provide  evidence  of success;  these are  not  redundant 

exercises in the sense used here.

IV.2.2 Ethical criteria for research projects under FP6 

A few conditions have already been laid down under FP6 to ensure that ethical 

requirements are met, and these can be taken over under FP7:  

1.  Applicants  must  explicitly  prove  that  the  regulatory  criteria  are  met  for  the 

given  project  and  must  indicate  the  relevant  national  legal  and/or  regulatory 

requirements  of  the  country/countries  where  the  research  takes  place, 
according to FP7, Article 6(3)96. For further information, see Annex 1; 

2.  Applicants must provide information that the hESCs used in the given project 

result from non-implanted IVF embryos (See following paragraph on donors’ 

rights); 

3.  Applicants  must  provide  information  on  the  protection  of  personal  data  and 

privacy of the donors of embryos for the creation of stem cell lines;  

4.  Applicants  must  provide  information  on  the  conditions  of  donation  of  the 

embryos  (e.g.  no  financial  inducement,  number  of  eggs  retrieved,  etc.).    In 

order to guarantee the non-commercialisation of the human body and in line 

with  Art.  12  of  Directive  2004/23,  the  EGE  holds  the  view  that  in  order  to 

protect the freedom of donation, human  embryo donation should not involve 

financial inducement, other than the reimbursement of costs incurred.  

In  addition  to  these  conditions,  the  EGE  recommends  that  the  ethics  review 

panel  should  ensure  that  applicants  provide  information  on  the  points  listed 

below.

IV.2.3 ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR FP7 

IV.2.3.1 Use of alternatives to hESCs 

Should  alternatives  to  hESCs  with  the  same  potential  as  embryo-derived  stem 

cells  be  found  in  the  future,  the  implications  of  such  developments  for  both 

scientific  and  ethical  aspects  of  the  hESC-based  research  projects  ought  to  be 

taken into account as soon as possible.  

IV.2.3.2 Donors’ rights 

The  donation  of  human  embryos  for  the  production  of  hESCs  for  research 

purposes poses a moral dilemma. This arises from the fact that human embryos 

are  not  ‘neutral  objects’.  Informed  consent  should  address  explicitly  this  moral 

dilemma, leaving the decision to the donors. 

The protection rights of donors need particular attention, in a very concrete way, 

meaning  that  those  countries  allowing  the  procurement  of  hESCs  must  provide 

information  on  the  procurement  process  for  the  stem  cell  lines  used  by  the 

applicant. The information should state that the measures of this process are in 

accordance with the fundamental ethical principles and human rights in force in 

the European Union, national legislation applicable at the time of the donation in 

the  country  where  the  donation  was  carried  out  and  other  relevant  EU 
regulations97. Applicants must provide information from the institutes generating 

the stem cell lines that the following criteria have been met for the procurement 

of hESCs:  

•  no pressure has been put on the donors at any stage98;  

97  See (EC/2004/23). 
98  See:  ISSCR  guidelines  (http://www.isscr.org/guidelines/  pp.9  'Procurement  of  materials:  For  donating 
embryos or gametes generated in the course of clinical treatment. Except when specifically authorized 
by  the  SCRO  (relevant  ethics  board)  process,  no  reimbursement  of  direct  expenses  or  financial 
considerations of any kind may be provided for donating embryos or gametes that have been generated 
in the course of clinical treatment and are in excess of clinical need or deemed of insufficient quality for 
clinical use. Researchers may not request that members of the infertility treatment team generate more

• 

the donor's health has not been put at risk by excessive ovarian stimulation;   

•  as far as new hESC lines are concerned, informed consent to the donation for 

research  of  an  embryo,  originally  planned  for  reproduction,  is  given  in 
knowledge  of  the  kind  of  research  intended99,  its  implications  (including 

commercial)  and  in  respect  of  the  conditions  foreseen  by  law  at  the  time  of 

the donation in the country where the donation was carried out; 

• 

information was given that consent could be withdrawn up to the stage of the 
creation of stem cells;100 

• 

infertility treatment and research was appropriately separated; 

•  no financial incentives  have been offered to donate  embryos for research at 
any  stage,  in  line  with  Art.  12  of  Directive  2004/23101.  However,  some 

members  of  the  EGE  hold  the  view  that  the  reduction  of  IVF  costs  is 

acceptable. 

If any of these criteria cannot be met because of the former conditions in which 

cell  lines  were  generated,  the  applicants  must  explain  why.  The  ethics  review 

board must then decide how to deal with this matter on a case-by-case basis; for 

new  hESC  lines  the  above  criteria  are  strongly  recommended  (see  following 

paragraph, IV2.4). 

Researchers must present all the data referred to donors in an anonymous way. 

The  process  used  to  encode  the  data  must  be  explained  and  referenced 
according to relevant provisions102,103.   

embryos or harvest more oocytes than necessary for the optimal chance of reproductive success. People 
who elect to donate stored materials for research should not be reimbursed for the costs of storage prior 
to the decision to donate. Reimbursement for direct expenses incurred by donors as a consequence of the 
consent process may be determined during the SCRO process'). 
99  ISSCR guidelines, 11.3-11.3a (http://www.isscr.org/guidelines/) 
100 Informed consent must take into account the fact that the materials will be used in the derivation of cells 
for research: “Consent for donation of materials for research should be obtained at the time of proposed 
transfer of materials to the research team. Only after a rigorous review by a SCRO mechanism or body 
can permission be granted to use materials for which prior consent exists but for which re-consent is 
prohibitively difficult.” (ISSCR, http://www.isscr.org/guidelines/)

IV.2.4  The  need  for  continuous  promotion  of  Public  Governance  and 

Science-Society Dialogue  

Apart  from  consent  and  respect  of  donors’  rights,  hESC  research  needs 

appropriate  measures  to  be  put  in  place  to  promote  the  public  governance  and 

science–society  dialogue  with  regard  to  its  aims,  achievements  and  failures. 

Adequate  means  should  be  established  for  public  access  to  relevant  and 

comprehensible  information  on  FP7  hESC  research  to  ensure  these  goals  are 

being continuously fostered and achieved.   

As the Council of Ministers has stated, the Commission is supporting the creation 

of  a  European  Registry  for  human  embryonic  stem  cell  lines.  This  Registry  is 

intended  to  allow  the  monitoring  of  existing  hESCs  in  Europe  and  to  help 

maximise their use by avoiding unnecessary derivations of new hESC lines.  

In  due  time,  the  Registry  should  ask  applicants  to  provide  relevant  data  on 

hESCs.  The  Registry  will  store  the  data  according  to  scientific  and  ethical 

standards  to  be  defined  by  its  newly  established  Scientific  and  Ethics  Advisory 

Boards.  

With  regard  to  the  use  of  the  hESC  lines  banked  in  the  Registry,  the  EGE 

recommends:  

•  Once  the  Registry  is  operational,  after  a  necessary  transitional  period,  the 

use of the hESC lines banked in the registry should be in line with the criteria 

indicated in IV.2.3. The Commission should develop and actively maintain the 

necessary means to ensure this requirement is fulfilled.  

•  Applicants  should  use  hESCs  banked  in  the  EU  Registry.  The  need  to  use 

other  hESC  lines  in  FP7  proposals  must  therefore  be  justified  on  both 

scientific and ethical grounds.

•  The Registry should prepare and publish  (on its website) information on the 

hESCs  banked  and  on  the  positive  and  negative  results  of  the  research 

performed  with/on  the  hESC  lines  provided  to  the  researchers.  At  the 

project's  conclusion,  in  addition  to  the  scientific  data,  particularly  health-

related  information,  the  publication  of  user-friendly  information  on  hESC 

research, freely accessible to EU citizens, is also highly recommended. The 

portal should include interactive elements if possible. 

Researchers working in the field have a responsibility to inform the public about 

their work, but also to engage with the social, political and ethical debates. With 

regard  to  open  questions  such  as  how  to  balance  different  rights  and  how  to 

prioritise  conflicting  interests,  researchers  should  participate  in  public  discourse 

and  respect  the  democratic  decision-making  process  with  regard  to  common 

societal goals. Applicants should therefore commit time, money and activities to 

advance  the  dialogue  of  science  and  society  in  the  field  of  human  embryonic 

stem  cell  research.  Applicants  for  hESC  research  under  FP7  are  therefore 

strongly encouraged to include the science and humanities dialogue, i.e. social, 

cultural/religious,  philosophical  and  ethical  reflection  on  hESC  research,  in  their 

projects  and  to  collaborate  for  this  purpose  with  other  disciplines  from  the 

humanities.  

IV.3 The need for further research and continuous public debate 

As  the  ethical  conflicts  concerning  hESCs  have  not  been  resolved  either 

academically  or  politically,  the  EGE  recommends  that,  under  the  FP7,  funding 

should  be  provided  in  order  to  foster  further  collaborative  and  multidisciplinary 

international  research  on  the  ethical  implications  of  hESC  research  and  the 

pertinent surrounding issues, as well as to encourage informed public debate.  

The EGE believes the following topics may be of particular immediate interest in 
such research and discourse: 

44

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 

the potentially conflicting goals of economic competitiveness and compliance 

with ethical standards;  

• 

the use of the human body for modern medicine, including commercialisation 

of products and procedures stemming from the use of human embryonic stem 

cells;  

• 

the  underlying  anthropology  of  human  embryonic  stem  cell  research, 

especially in the light of hybrids and the chimera research connected to stem 

cell research;  

•  optimisation  of  clinical  and  therapeutic  needs  of  patients  suffering  from  the 

most common diseases addressed in hESC research on treatment and/or for 

specific diseases; 

• 

 policy  regarding  numbers  and  production  process  of  stem  cell  lines 

necessary in the case of successful therapies;  

• 

the  correlation  of  human  embryonic  stem  cell  research  and  questions 

concerning  regenerative  medicine,  health-related  justice,  including  the  issue 

of global justice; 

• 

the  relation  between  science  and  humanities  and  between  science  and 

society with respect to the development of new technologies;  

• 

the  ongoing  efforts  of  scientific  alternatives  and  their  anthropological  and 

ethical interpretations. 

The  EGE  also  acknowledges  that  a  number  of  issues  will  need  further 

clarification,  interdisciplinary  research,  thorough  ethical  evaluation  and,  if  found 

necessary  in  the  future,  also  appropriate  legal  action.  At  present,  the  EGE 

believes, the following issues require particular attention:  

1.  The  current  provisions  for  patenting  hESC-derived  materials  need  to  be 

addressed.  Given  new  developments 

in 

research  and 

taking 

into 

45

 
 
  
 
 
 
consideration  the  ongoing  debate  on  the  limits  of  patenting  of  biological 
materials, the EGE would like to deal with this issue at a later point in time104.  

2.  The  tension  induced  by  a  policy  that  encourages  both  free  donation105  and 

commercial use of derivates from human substances needs to be addressed. 

The EGE emphasises its view that the use of human embryos to generate stem 

cells should be minimised as much as possible.  The EGE calls on the European 

Union to develop appropriate systems to minimise the use of human embryos to 

cases for which no alternatives exist. 

IV.4  Review  of  Recommendations  and  Communication  with  the 
Advisory Board of the European Registry on Human Embryonic 
Stem Cell Research 

The  EGE  would  also  welcome  interaction  with  the  Advisory  Board  of  the 

European  Registry  on  hESC  Research,  in  particular  with  the  Registry’s  Ethics 

Advisory  Board,  in  order  to  address  the  ethical  concerns  regarding  the 

procurement  of  stem  cells  and  the  storing  of  data  in  the  light  of  the  ongoing 

progress in this area.  

The  concrete  form  and  means  of  this  collaboration  should  be  specified  and  put 

into  place,  and  should  be  appropriately  supported  and 

funded  by 

the 

Commission.

THE SIXTH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME 

The Sixth Framework Programme covers Community 

activities in the field of research, technological development 

and demonstration (RTD) for the period 2002 to 2006 

PROCEDURAL MODALITIES FOR RESEARCH ACTIVITIES INVOLVING 
BANKED OR ISOLATED HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS IN CULTURE TO 
BE FUNDED UNDER COUNCIL DECISION 2002/834/EC  

Introduction  

Pursuant  to  the  Council  Decision  adopting  a  specific  programme  for  research, 
technological development and demonstration, “Integrating and strengthening the 
European  Research  Area”  (2002-2006)106,  and  in  particular  Article  6(3),  the 
Commission  has  adopted  procedural  modalities  to  clarify  the  procedure  which 
the  Commission  will  follow  when  evaluating,  selecting  and  supporting  research 
projects  involving  the  use  of  banked  or  isolated  human  embryonic  stem  cells  in 
culture.  

Procedural modalities for research activities involving banked or isolated human 
embryonic  stem  cells 
funded  under  Council  Decision 
to  be 
2002/834/EC107 

in  culture 

When evaluating, and selecting proposals involving the use of banked or isolated 
human  embryonic  stem  cells  (hESC)  in  culture  and  negotiating  the  related 
contracts, the Commission uses the following procedure: 

1.  Proposal:  Proposers  are  requested  to  address,  in  the  application  form,  the 
potential  ethical  aspects  of  the  proposed  research  in  terms  of  its  objectives, 
methodology  and  the  possible  implications  of  the  results.  Pursuant  to  the 
Decision on the Workprogramme in the framework of the specific programme for 
research, 
technical  development  and  demonstration  on  "Integrating  and 
strengthening the European Research Area"108 (hereinafter the Workprogramme) 
they should justify the research design, explain how ethical requirements will be 
fulfilled and indicate the relevant national legal and/or regulatory requirements of 
the country(ies) where the research takes place.

2. Evaluation: Proposals are evaluated in accordance with the procedure set out 
in the “Guidelines on Proposal Evaluation and Selection Procedures” established 
by Decision C(2003)883, (hereinafter the Guidelines) by a panel of independent 
experts, after those experts have individually examined the projects in the light of 
each block of evaluation criteria.  
The experts also assess whether the use of banked or isolated hESC in culture is 
necessary  in  order  to  achieve  the  scientific  objectives  set  forth  in  the  proposal. 
This point is documented in the consensus report provided for in the Guidelines 

3.  Ethical  review:  The  ethical  review  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  the 
procedure  set  out  in  the  Guidelines  and  the  common  evaluation  criteria  for 
evaluating proposals set out in Annex B to the Workprogramme. 

In  the  course  of  that  review,  the  ethical  review  panel  examines  whether  the 
proposal  complies  with  the  rules  relating  to  ethics  set  out  in  Decision  No 
1513/2002/EC109 and Decision 2002/834/EC. 

In addition, that panel assesses: 

a)  whether  the  proposers  have  taken  into  account  the  legislation, 
regulations,  ethical  rules  and/or  codes  of  conduct  in  place  in  the 
country(ies)  where  the  research  using  banked  or  isolated  hESC  in 
culture  is  to  take  place,  including  the  procedures  for  obtaining 
informed consent; 

b) 

the source of the banked or isolated hESC in culture;  

c) 

the measures taken to protect personal data, including genetic data, 
and privacy; 

d) 

the nature of financial inducements, if any. 

When  preparing  the  ethical  review,  the  Commission  may  request  that  the 
proposers provide additional information on the way the ethical issues raised by 
the project will be handled. 

4.  National  approvals  and  opinions  of  competent  ethics  committee:  The 
Commission ascertains that the participants have received appropriate approval 
from the national authority and/or a favourable opinion from the competent ethics 
committee before the signature of the contract, or before the banked or isolated 
hESC in culture are to be used in the project. 

5.  Negotiation:  During  the  negotiation  of  the  contract,  account  is  taken  of  the 
results  of  the  ethical  review.  The  result  of  the  ethical  review  is  reflected  in  the 
technical  annex  of  the  contract.  Where  the  approval  of  the  national  authority

and/or  a  favourable  opinion  from  a  local  ethical  committee  is/are  not  obtained 
before  the  start  of  the  contract,  the  contract  includes  a  special  clause  requiring 
that  the  relevant  authorisation  or  opinion  be  obtained  before  the  start  of  the 
corresponding research. 

6.  Selection:  In  accordance  with  Article  6(3)  of  Decision  2002/834/EC  any 
proposal  involving  the  use  of  human  embryonic  stem  cells  is  submitted  for  an 
opinion  to  the  Programme  Committee  established  by  Article  7(1)  of  Decision 
2002/834/EC.

Ethical Review Procedures in FP7 

- 

Ethical Issues  

Describe any ethical issues that may arise in their proposal. In particular, you should explain the 
benefit and burden of their experiments and the effects it may have on the research subject.  

The following special issues should be taken into account:  

Informed consent: When describing issues relating to informed consent, it will be necessary to 
illustrate  an  appropriate  level  of  ethical  sensitivity,  and  consider  issues  of  insurance,  incidental 
findings and the consequences of leaving the study.  

Data protection issues: Avoid the unnecessary collection and use of personal data. Identify the 
source  of  the  data,  describing  whether  it  is  collected  as  part  of  the  research  or  is  previously 
collected  data  being  used.    Consider  issues  of  informed  consent  for  any  data  being  used. 
Describe how personal identify of the data is protected.  

Use  of  animals:  Where  animals  are  used  in  research  the  application  of  the  3Rs  (Replace, 
Reduce,  Refine)  must  be  convincingly  addressed.    Numbers  of  animals  should  be  specified. 
Describe what happens to the animals after the research experiments.  

Human  embryonic  stem  cells:  Research  proposals  that  will  involve  human  embryonic  stem 
cells (hESC) will have to address all the following specific points:  

the  necessity  to  use  hESC  in  order  to  achieve  the  scientific  objectives  set  forth  in  the 

proposal.  

whether the applicants have taken into account the legislation, regulations, ethical rules 
and/or  codes  of  conduct  in  place  in  the  country(ies)  where  the  research  using  hESC  is  to  take 
place, including the procedures for obtaining informed consent;  

the source of the hESC

the nature of financial inducements, if any.  

Identify  the  countries  where  research  will  be  undertaken  and  which  ethical  committees  and 
regulatory organisations will need to be approached during the life of the project.     

Include the Ethical issues table below.  If you indicate YES to any issue, please identify the pages 
in  the  proposal  where  this  ethical  issue  is  described.  Answering  'YES'  to  some  of  these  boxes 
does not automatically lead to an ethical review.  It enables the independent experts to decide if 
an ethical review is required. If you are sure that none of the issues apply to your proposal, simply 
tick the YES box in the last row.  

(No recommended length for section 4 - depends on the number of such issues involved)   

Notes:  Only  in  exceptional  cases  will  additional  information  be  sought  for  clarification,  which 
means that any ethical review will be performed solely on the basis of the information available in 
the  proposal
.  Projects  raising  specific  ethical  issues  such  as  research  intervention  on  human 
beings; research on human embryos and human embryonic stem cells and non-human primates 
are automatically submitted for ethical review.

Yes:      

At universities or in cooperation with universities,  
after consent of the local ethical commission and  
after positive advice (within 2 months) of the Federal Commission for medical and scientific 
research on embryos in vitro 
 Loi du 11 mai 2003 : Art. 7. § 1er. Toute recherche sur des embryons in vitro doit être soumise 
au préalable au comité local d'éthique de l'établissement universitaire concerné et à la 
Commission fédérale pour la recherche médicale et scientifique sur les embryons in vitro visée à 
l'article 9. 
  La demande d'avis est introduite conjointement par le chercheur et le chef du laboratoire de 
procréation médicalement assistée ou de génétique humaine agréé de l'établissement 
universitaire concerné ou de l'établissement qui a conclu une convention avec un établissement 
universitaire. 
  La demande d'avis comporte une description détaillée de l'objectif, de la méthodologie et de la 
durée de la recherche. Elle indique spécialement si la recherche a lieu sur des embryons 
surnuméraires ou des embryons créés aux fins de recherche. 
  § 2. L'avis du comité local d'éthique est rendu dans un délai de deux mois qui suivent la 
demande d'avis. 
  Si l'avis du comité local d'éthique est négatif, le projet de recherche est abandonné. 
  Le chercheur et le chef de laboratoire portent à la connaissance de la Commission fédérale 
pour la recherche médicale et scientifique sur les embryons in vitro, visée à l'article 9, leur 
demande d'avis ainsi que l'avis positif du comité local d'éthique. Si dans un délai de deux mois 
après cette transmission la commission n'a pas émis d'avis négatif à la majorité de ses 
membres, le projet de recherche est autorisé et peut être entamé. Toutes les décisions de la

/ the object of Ordinance regulation is only  the “embryonic organs, tissue 
and cells” after abortion -  Art.1 and Art.4/ 

Remark:  To my opinion, the term “human embryonic stem sells” have 
an wide and narrow understanding.. The “wide” meaning comprises 
zygotes and life embryo  as  a source  of stem cells. 
The narrow  meaning comprises only life embryo as a  source  of stem 
cells. 
Therefore it will be useful to specify what meaning should be the right 
contents of the term “hESC’.

Kapitel 7  

Forbud mod forskning og forsøg  

§ 25. Biomedicinske forsøg på befrugtede menneskelige æg samt på kønsceller, der 

agtes anvendt til befrugtning, må kun foretages i følgende tilfælde:  
1) Hvis de har til formål at forbedre in vitro-befrugtning eller lignende teknikker med 

henblik på at fremkalde en graviditet.  

2) Hvis de har til formål at forbedre teknikker til genetisk undersøgelse af et befrugtet 

æg med henblik på at fastslå, om der foreligger en alvorlig arvelig sygdom eller en 
væsentlig kromosomabnormitet (præimplantationsdiagnostik).  

3) Hvis forsøgene ved anvendelse af befrugtede æg og stamceller herfra har til formål 

at opnå ny viden, som vil kunne forbedre mulighederne for behandling af 
sygdomme hos mennesker.

Unofficial translation of the paragraph: 
“The human body, at the various stages of its formation and development, and the 
simple discovery of one of its elements, including a sequence or partial sequence of a 
gene, cannot constitute patentable inventions. 
Subs. 2. Notwithstanding subsection 1 hereof, an element isolated from the human 
body or otherwise produced by means of a technical process, including a sequence or 
partial sequence of a gene, may constitute a patentable invention, even if the structure 
of that element is identical to that of a natural element.”

Medical Research Act, 488/1999. www.finlex.fi  
Translation: see: http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990488.pdf 
Does the regulation provide a definition of 'embryo', if so which one? 
Yes. ‘embryo’ means a living group of cells resulting from fertilisation not implanted in a 
woman’s body 

Is hESC research allowed and in what terms and conditions? 
It is allowed. Embryos shall be used for research only with a written informed consent 
from the donors of the gametes. Consent can be withdrawn in any time (Act on medical 
Research, section 12) Only supernumerary embryos shall be used for research. The 
production of embryos exclusively for the purpose of research is forbidden. (Act on 
Medical Research, section 13). When hESC lines have been produced, the law does 
not make any further provisions on the use of these cells. The production of hESC 
needs the favourable opinion of an ethics committee of a hospital district, and the 
research on embryos can be done only in the institutions that have got an authorisation 
from the National Authority of Medicolegal Affairs (TEO) The use of embryos for 
research is allowed only for 14 days after fertilization 
If yes, which body is in charge of the approval of hESC research (ethics review)? 
Ethics committees of hospital districts evaluate the research projects, although the 
research of cell lines is not specifically regulated in the Medical Research Act. The 
Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has established a working group on Biobanks that 
is working on the issue of biobanks including ethics evaluation of establishment of 
biobank and ethics evaluation of the research projects. 
Is the creation of embryos for research purposes, or stem cells procurement, 
allowed in your country, if yes at what conditions? 
Medical Research Act states that The production of embryos exclusively for the purpose 
of research shall be forbidden. However, the Act also determines the embryo as “the 
living group of cells resulting from fertilisation”. This can be interpreted so that cells 
produced by the somatic cell nuclear transfer are not considered as embryos. 
Is the source of hESC used in research traceable and well documented? 
Anonymisation and coding as far as possible should be used  in each project 
 What are the formal ethical and legal requirements for hESC research approval? 
We have formal ethical and legal requirements for embryo research stated in the 
Medical Research Act. Further requirements concerning hESC lines have not been 
established. The working group is working on this issue concerning research on 
biological sample collections.  
 Does the relevant regulatory frame foresee informed consent procedures from 
individuals involved in embryo donation for research, if so could you please

No; donation must be voluntary. Only compensation of the expenses and harms 
(healthy donors) is allowed according to Decree 1390/2006. There are not such 
expences or harm related to hESC while embryos that could be donated for research 
are surplus embryos. 

 Are ad hoc data protection provisions be defined for hESC research? 
No, regular data protection provisions similar to medical research in general are applied 
to hESC research. 

Are data deriving from hESC projects necessarily provided, whether positive or 
negative (in form of publications)? 
Not necessarily, only when they are published. 

How is patenting of hESC lines regulated? 
We have Act on Patenting (550/1967, amendment 650/2000) that has implemented the 
EU Directive of biopatenting. It states that (Section 1a and b) human body or its part, 
whole or partial sequence of a gene or similar finding cannot be patented, but isolated 
or otherwise produced item, sequence or partial sequence of a single gene form an 
invention that can be patented, if provisions otherwise are fulfilled, although the 
structure of this item would be similar to natural item. However, section 1 b states that 
(3) uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes cannot be patented

http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stzg/index.html 

Does the regulation provide a definition of 'embryo', if so which one? 
For the purpose of the Embryo Protection Act, an embryo means a fertilised human egg 
capable of developing from the time of fusion of the nuclei, and further each totipotent 
cell removed from an embryo that is capable of dividing and developing into an 
individual human being if the necessary conditions prevail. (ESchG §8 (1)). 

For the Stem Cell Act embryo means any human totipotent cell which has the potential 
to divide and to develop into a human being if the necessary conditions prevail (StZG §3 
(4)). 
Is hESC research allowed and in what terms and conditions? 
According to the Embryo Protection Act the production of hESCs is forbidden. The Stem 
Cell Act ensures the protection of embryos in connection with the importation and 
utilization of human embryonic stem cells. hESC research is only permitted using cell 
lines created before 1 January 2002 in the country of origin in accordance with relevant 
national legislation there and kept in culture or subsequently stored using 
cryopreservation methods. The embryos from which they were derived must have been 
produced by medically-assisted in vitro fertilization in order to induce pregnancy and 
definitely no longer used for this purpose and no evidence that this was due to reasons 
inherent in the embryos themselves. No compensation or other benefit in money’s worth 
may have been granted or promised for the donation of embryos for the purpose of 
stem cell derivation.  
If yes, which body is in charge of the approval of hESC research (ethics review)? 
The Central Ethics Committee for Stem Cell Research at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
is in charge of the approval of applications to import hESCs.  

The RKI is the federal institution responsible for disease control and prevention and the 
central federal reference institution for applied and response-orientated research as well

 What are the formal ethical and legal requirements for hESC research approval? 
The hESC research has to serve eminent research aims to generate scientific 
knowledge in basic research or to increase medical knowledge for the development of 
diagnostic, preventive or therapeutic methods to be applied to humans and according to 
the state-of-the-art of science and technology. Firstly the questions to be studied in the 
research project concerned must been clarified as far as possible through in vitro 
models using animal cells or through animal experiments and secondly the scientific 
knowledge to be obtained from the research project concerned cannot be expected to 
be gained by using cells other than embryonic stem cells. 

Any importation and any utilization of embryonic stem cells has to be subject to 
approval by the stem cell ethics committee for stem cell research at the Robert Koch 
Institute. Applications for approval must be submitted in writing. In the documents 
accompanying the application, the applicant shall provide the following information in 
particular: 
1. Name and official address of the person responsible for the research project 
concerned, 2. a description of the research project including scientific reasons showing 
that the research project meets the requirements described,3. a documentation 
concerning the embryonic stem cells to be imported or used showing that the 
requirements have been complied with equivalent evidence. 

The embryonic stem cells to be imported or used must be identical with those registered 
in a scientifically recognized, publicly accessible registry maintained by government 
agencies or agencies authorized by the government.

derivation. 

 Are ad hoc data protection provisions be defined for hESC research? 
Ad hoc data protection provisions are not mentioned in the Stem Cell Act. 

Are data deriving from hESC projects necessarily provided, whether positive or 
negative (in form of publications)? 
An obligation for publication is not mentioned in the Stem Cell Act. 

How is patenting of hESC lines regulated? 
The Biotechnology Patenting Directive (98/44/EC) negotiated by the European 
Parliament and the European Council on 6 July 1998 provides a uniform procedure for 
the patenting of biotechnological inventions in all EU Member States. 

In December 2004 Germany implemented the Biotechnology Patenting Directive and 
enacted the law 28 February 2005 (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Richtlinie über den 
rechtlichen Schutz biotechnologischer Erfindungen (BioPatG), Act Implementing the 
Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions in Germany).  
In December 2006 the German Federal Patent Court partially reversed their 1999 
decision on Professor Oliver Brüstle's patent, saying that anything made from human 
tissue cannot be patented.

Embryos cannot be created for research purposes, only embryos created in medically 
assisted human procreation procedures (MAP) can be used for research and 
experiments, either on the basis of the decision of those entitled to decide, or in case of 
damage of the embryo. If an embryo was donated for a MAP procedure, but not used 
within 10 years following the donation, the embryo can be used for research purposes.

Please list existing regulation applying to human embryonic stem cells (hESC) 
research (web address where to get the texts would be welcomed). 

Ireland  currently  has  no  specific  legislation  dealing  with  embryonic  stem  cell  research 
and furthermore does not have a legislative basis for the practice of IVF and therefore 
has  no  legislation  pertaining  to  use  of  embryos  (supernumerary  or  otherwise)  for 
research.  The  Medical  Council's  Guide  to  Ethical  Conduct  and  Behaviour  6th  edition 
2004  states  that  in  relation  to  IVF  "that  any  fertilised  ovum  must  be  used  for  normal 
implantation  and  must  not  be  deliberately  destroyed".  They  also  state  "the  creation  of 
new life forms for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of 
in-vitro  human  life  already  formed  is  professional  misconduct".  It  should  be  noted  that 
the Medical Council only regulate physicians and therefore scientists are not bound by 
the guide, e.g. it would appear that there is currently no legal impediment on importation 
or use of embryonic stem cells lines by scientists.   

Following  a  referendum  some  years  ago,  The  Irish  Constitution  was  amended  and 
Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution acknowledges the right to life of the unborn. However, 
no  legislation  followed  this  amendment  e.g.  to  articulate  what  is  defined  as  ‘unborn’, 
would  this  include  supernumerary  embryos  in  storage  etc.  This  Constitutional 
Amendment has been interpreted by some to mean that embryonic stem cell research 
would be prohibited by our constitution. A recent high court judgment (Nov 2006) found 
that  three  frozen  embryos  resulting  from  IVF  are  not  "unborn"  as  defined  under  the 
Constitution. This judgment has been appealed to the Supreme Court. 

Does the regulation provide a definition of 'embryo', if so which one?

Is hESC research allowed and in what terms and conditions? 
There is no legislation prohibiting ESC research in Ireland. It would appear from the

Constitution. Further clarification will be forthcoming following a decision from the 
Supreme Court

The Dutch ‘Act containing rules relating to the use of human gametes and embryos’ (Embryos 
Act) came into force on September 1th 2002. A translation can be found at: 
http://www.minvws.nl/en/folders/ibe/2002/introduction-embryo-act.asp  
Does the regulation provide a definition of 'embryo', if so which one? 
Embryos Act, Section 1: 
In this Act the following words shall have the following meanings: 
(….) 
c. embryo: a cell or a complex of cells with the capacity to develop into a human being; 
(…) 
This definition is criticised as being too narrow (excluding non-viable embryos). Cf:   
-Health Council of the Netherlands: Embryonic stem cells without moral pain? (2005).

hESC research is allowed. There are no special conditions for hESC research using existing 
stem cell lines. hESC involving the use of human embryos is subjected to the general 
conditions for research using human embryos set in the Embryos Act (including the 
moratorium regarding the creation of embryos for other purposes than pregnancy; cf sub 
question 5).  

4 

If yes, which body is in charge of the approval of hESC research (ethics review)? 

Only hESC research involving the use of human embryos requires special approval. The 
Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects and Embryo Research (CCMO) is 
in charge of this. Website: www.ccmo.nl The head of the bureau of the national review 
committee (CCMO) is dr. Marcel Kenter; e-mail ccmo@ccmo.nl  Tel +31 70 3406700.

The Embryos Act prohibits the creation of embryos for purposes other than reproduction 
(section 24a). This also applies to ‘therapeutic cloning’ using human stem cells. However, the 
Act also contains the provision that this ban shall lapse on a date to be determined within five 
years after the coming into force of the Act (ie before September 2007), thus effectively 
turning the ban into a moratorium (section 33 sub 2). The Act already contains provisions for 
the handling of embryos created for purposes other than reproduction which would come into 
force after the lifting of the ban (sections 9 and 11). Section 11 limits the types of research for 
which embryos may then be created to 1) research which is reasonably likely to lead to new 
insights in the fields of infertility, 2) artificial reproduction techniques, 3) hereditary or 
congenital diseases or 4) transplant medicine. 

This complex construction was chosen in order to allow for making a reservation to Article 18 
of the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (forbidding the creation of 
embryos for research purposes) when ratifying that Convention (as the Netherlands intends 
to do).  

The report of the recent evaluation of the Embryos Act (2006) has called for a swift end to the 
present moratorium on creating embryos for other purposes than pregnancy. Translated 
summary of report: 
http://www.zonmw.nl/fileadmin/cm/vraagsturing/documenten/Evaluatie_regelgeving/embryos_
act_en_sum.pdf   

However, the new government coalition formed early 2007 (Labour & two Christian Democrat 
parties) has announced its intention to maintain the current ban (possibly in the form of 
extending the moratorium for some further years). No formal decision about this has as yet 
been taken.

Is the source of hESC used in research traceable and well documented?

 What are the formal ethical and legal requirements for hESC research approval? 

Cf questions 4 and 8 

8 

 Does the relevant regulatory frame foresee informed consent procedures from 
individuals involved in embryo donation for research, if so could you please describe 
them? 

Yes. As specified in section 8.2 of the Embryos Act, embryos may be made available only by 
means of a written donation and without consideration, and only after the persons concerned 
(which may also include a gamete donor), have been informed by the person storing the 
embryos regarding the nature and the purpose thereof. Where a difference of opinion arises 
between the parties concerned, the embryos shall not be made available. Any of the persons 
concerned may revoke his/her decision at any time before the embryos have been used, 
without giving reasons. 
In the report of the recent evaluation of the Embryos Act (2006), it is pointed out that the Act 
does not provide sufficient guidance as to the required specificity of the information to be 
given about the nature of the research. Cf summary of report: 
http://www.zonmw.nl/fileadmin/cm/vraagsturing/documenten/Evaluatie_regelgeving/embryos_

 Is financial inducement allowed? If so, in what terms?

No, cf question 8: embryos may only be donated ‘without consideration’. The same holds for 
the donation of gametes. In practice, a renumeration of expenses is accepted.  
The report of the recent evaluation of the Embryos Act (2006) contains the recommendation 
to further debate the desirability/acceptability of a larger recompensation for women donating 
oocytes for research. Cf  summary of report:

1 

Please list existing regulation applying to human embryonic stem cells (hESC) 
research (web address where to get the texts would be welcomed). 
In Poland there is no research on embryonic stem cells. 

Polish legal rules do not include distinct regulations for human embryonic stem cells 
research. There is also no legal definition for embryo stage of life. 
The fundamental legal act in Poland is the Constitution of the Republic of Poland 
(http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm), which was passed by the 
National Assembly on April 2nd, 1997. In accordance with Art.38 of this Law the 
Republic of Poland shall ensure the legal protection of the life of every human being 
Regulations referring to legal protection and conduct rules in the pre-birth stage of 
human life are included in the Act of January 7th, 1993 on Family Planning, 
Protection of Human Foetus and Admissible Conditions for an Abortion. 
In accordance with Art.1 of this Law, the right to life is protected, including also the 
prenatal stage, in the scope stipulated by the Law. The Law also includes regulations 
concerning the conceived child that is from the moment of conception through the 
embryo and foetal stages until birth.  
According to Art.157a of the Criminal Code any person except for child’s mother who 
commits any infringement to a conceived child, will be punished. The rule does not 
include a physician who undertakes medical action necessary to exclude danger-
threatening mother’s or child’s health or life. 
What's more, under the Act of December 5th, 1996 on Medical Profession’s, human 
embryos (conceived children) may not be used for therapeutic research (Art. 26 
paragraph 1).  
Not directly refers to this matter the ruling of the Constitutional Court of the 
Republic of Poland from the 28th May 1997, which says: “A democratic state 
governed by the rule of law holds man and his most precious weal as a supreme value. 
By this weal, we understand life which in a democratic state governed by the rule of law 
must enjoy constitutional protection in each stage of its development”.

In Portugal, Law n. 32/2006, of the 26th of July, concerning Medically Assisted 
Reproduction, addresses hESC research. 
The text is available on http://www.dre.pt/pdfgratisa5/2006/07/14300.pdf (Portuguese 
version only) 
Does the regulation provide a definition of 'embryo', if so which one? 

The Portuguese regulation doesn’t provide a definition of “embryo”. 
Is hESC research allowed and in what terms and conditions? 
The article n. 9 of the law forbids the deliberate production of human embryos 
specifically for research purposes. 
However, scientific hESC research can be allowed provided it is reasonable to expect 
that the investigation project will benefit mankind. Research must aim: 

Prevention, diagnosis or therapy on embryos; 

Perfection of Medically Assisted Reproduction techniques; 

Creation of stem cell banks for transplantation programs or other therapeutic 
purposes. 

If yes, which body is in charge of the approval of hESC research (ethics review)? 

The law n. º 36/2006 created the National Council for Medically Assisted Reproduction, 
in charge of the approval of the investigation projects for hESC research. 
Is the creation of embryos for research purposes, or stem cells procurement, 
allowed in your country, if yes at what conditions? 

As mentioned above, the deliberate production of human embryos specifically for 
research purposes is forbidden. 
According to Arts. 9, 24 and 25, IVF techniques must ensure only the necessary 
number of embryos for the success of the IVF process.  
Only embryos whit particularly severe genetic anomalies with no conditions to be 
preserved or implanted, embryos not derived by fertilization of a human oocyte by 
human sperm, or those created to enhance the success rate of IVF who became 
supernumerary and no longer a part of a parental project, can be used for research 
purposes. 
Is the source of hESC used in research traceable and well documented? 

According to Art. 16, personal genetic and health data regarding medically assisted 
reproduction techniques is regulated by Law n.º 12/2005, of the 26th of January, 
concerning genetic and health personal information. 

The text is available on http://www.dre.pt/pdfgratisa5/2005/01/018A00.pdf (Portuguese

The regulation of the conditions under which the investigation projects will be evaluated 
is being prepared. 

However, in Art. 9º the actual law still requires that scientific hESC research is made for 
prevention, diagnosis or therapy on embryos, for the perfection of Medically Assisted 
Reproduction techniques or for the creation of stem cell banks for transplantation 
programs or other therapeutic purposes. 

Additionally, research can be allowed provided it is reasonable to expect that the 
investigation project will benefit mankind. 
 Does the relevant regulatory frame foresee informed consent procedures from 
individuals involved in embryo donation for research, if so could you please 
describe them? 

According to the present law, the use of supernumerary embryos or of embryos with 
particularly severe genetic anomalies entails previous informed consent from donors. 
This consent must also be express, free and conscientious. 

It is expected that the regulation to further to the law establishes further requirements 
for consent. 
 Is financial inducement allowed? If so, in what terms? 

Art. 18 states that the purchase or sell of embryos or any other biological material 
obtained from the use of Medically Assisted Reproduction techniques is forbidden.

At this time, there is no knowledge of research involving human embryos being made in 
Portugal. 
The regulatory framework under which the investigation projects will be made is being 
prepared. 
How is patenting of hESC lines regulated? 

By the Decree-Law n.º 36/2003, of the 5th of March, Portugal transposed the Directive 
98/44/CE of the European Parliament and the Council of the 6th of July, regarding the 
legal protection of biotechnological inventions. 
Art. 53º of this decree-law states that the use of human embryos for industrial or 
commercial purposes, as well as the human body, in his various stages of development 
or by the mere discovery of one of his elements, aren’t patentable.

No specific regulations exist at present. There is an extensive governmental regulation 
in preparation, however, to deal with the “donation, procurement, testing and distribution 
of organs, tissues and cells, and processing, conservation and storage of tissues and 
cells” (transposition of the requirements of the Dir. 2006/17/EC, ev. Dir. 2004/23/EC). It

Does the regulation provide a definition of 'embryo', if so which one? 
N.A. (non-applicable) 

Is hESC research allowed and in what terms and conditions? 
hESC research is not specifically prohibited by a law, however, according to the position 
the Slovak Republic (SR) has taken so far on the issue, it probably would not be 
allowed to take place in the country (as destroying of a human embryo is necessary to 
obtain the hESCs lines for research).  
The “non-therapeutic” research on human embryo and fetus, as well as human cloning 
are prohibited both by the SR’s health law (law No. 576/2004 Coll. as later amended) 
and by SR’s Penal Code (law No. 300/2005 Coll.) – making both a criminal offence.

Please list existing regulation applying to human embryonic stem cells (hESC) 
research (web address where to get the texts would be welcomed). 
Explicit legal regulation on hESC does not exist. However, the Law on treatment of 
infertility and biomedically assisted fertilisation (Zakon o zdravljenju neplodnosti in 
postopkih oploditve z biomedicinsko pomocjo, /ZZNPOB/ 3307, Uradni list Republike 
Slovenije 70/2000, 8. 8. 2000, UL ONLINE)  contains provisions that apply to research 
on embryos from IVF procedures and may apply to procurement of hESC.  
Web address (Ministry of Health): http://www.mz.gov.si 
Does the regulation provide a definition of 'embryo', if so which one? 
Article 4: The embryo is created by fertilisation of the ovum. For the purposes of this 
Law, the early embryo is a zygote or an embryo that has developed outside the uterus 
for less than 14 days or until the appearance of the primitive streak. 

Is hESC research allowed and in what terms and conditions? 
As said above, research on hESC is not specifically regulated.  

Slovenia is party to the Oviedo Convention and the protocol on prohibition of human 
cloning. Its Law on treatment of infertility and biomedically assisted fertilisation forbids 
the creation of human embryos for research, the production of cloned embryos and the 
use of in vitro fertilisation for any purpose other that birth of a child. Also prohibited is 
the use of parts of embryo for any purpose other than is explicitly allowed by law.  

However, the law allows research on surplus embryos from in vitro fertilization 
procedures (and thus also procurement of hESC), if several conditions are fulfilled:  

Article 38 (unofficial translation) 

Scientific research on the gametes and early embryos (= in vitro embryos) is allowed 
exclusively for the purposes of (promoting knowledge on) protection and improvement 
of human health. It may be carried out on early embryos only if it cannot be done on 
animal embryos or otherwise with comparable efficiency. Early embryos may only be 
used for research after a written informed consent has been obtained for their parents 
who had undergone medically  assisted reproduction. The research must be authorised 
by the National Commission for Assisted Reproduction and must be approved and 
supervised by the National Medical Ethics Committee (NMEC). Permission may be 
granted for embryos that, according to medical knowledge, are not suitable to be 
transferred into woman’s body or for storage, or would have to be left to perish 
according to the Article 35 of the Law (end of the maximum storage period). In research 
on embryos, current medical knowledge, experience, established practices and 
principles of general medical ethics must be taken into account.

hESC  derived  from  embryos  and  has  approved  harvesting  hESC  from  nonviable 
embryos from in vitro fertilisation procedures.

2 

Does the regulation provide a definition of 'embryo', if so which one? 
Yes, it does. 
In the Spanish legislation there are two definitions,  on the human pre-embryo and on the 
human embryo:  

a) Pre-embryo: the in vitro embryo as constituted by a group of cells derived of the 
continuous division of the fertilised oocyte until 14 days later (art. 1.2 of HARTAct and art. 3, 
s,  BMRAct) 

b) Embryo: A step of embryonic development, which includes the time in what the fertilised 
oocyte is located in the uterus of a woman until the time of the beginning of the step of the 
formation of organs, it is to say, 56 days after fertilisation occurs, regardless the time during 
such development could be stopped (art. 3, l, BMRAct). 

3 

Is hESC research allowed and in what terms and conditions? 
Yes, this type of research is allowed but only under case by case scrutiny. The research 
project has to fulfil, by the research group, the ethical guarantees requested. 
A) From surplus pre-embryos HARTAct): 
Article 15. Using pre-embryos for research purposes. 

Informed consent of the couple or of the single woman. 

a) 
b)  The pre-embryo shall not be developed in vitro more than 14 days, regardless the time it could be 

cryo-preserved 

c)  Research shall be performed in authorised centres 
d)  Research will be done on the basis of a research project authorised by the competent authority, 

previous the perceptive and favourable Commission (see down). 

B) From cloned pre-embryos (BMRAct): 
Article 34 Guarantees and requisites for research 
1. Research or experimentation with surplus oocytes and pre-embryos from the application of assisted

reproduction techniques, or from their biological structures, with the aim to obtain, develop and use 
embryonic stem cell lines or with other purposes not associated with the development and application 
of assisted reproduction techniques, shall be undertaken in accordance with the conditions established 
in Law 14/2006, of 26 May, and comply with the following requisites: 

a)  That the research abides by the applicable ethical principles and legal regulations, especially 
in  that  provided  in  this  Law  and  its  development  of  rules  and  guidelines  in  law,  and  that  it 
follows  the  principles  of  relevance,  feasibility  and  suitability,  specifically  of  the  main 
researcher,  of  the  research  team  and  of  the  facilities  of  the  centre  that  shall  undertake  the 
research. 

b)  That  it  is  based  on  a  research  project  authorised  by  the  relevant  State  or  autonomous 
authorities,  after  a  favourable  report  by  the  Commission  for  establishing  guarantees  in  the 
donation and use of human cells and tissues, in the event that the project deals with matters 
provided in article 35. 

2. The authorisation of the research projects shall be conditioned on the project  including at least the 
following elements: 

a) The authorisation by the management of the centre that shall undertake the research, as 

well as the favourable report of the corresponding Research Ethics Committee. 

b) The notification of the common relations and interests, of any nature or the absence of 
such, between the team and the centre that have undertaken each of the processes of assisted 
reproduction that have generated pre-embryos or have intervened in the obtaining of oocytes. 
c) The written commitment to supply to the corresponding public authority the data that will 
permit to identify and know the storage of the cell lines that could be obtained as a consequence 
of the development of the research. 

d) The commitment of the free conveyance of line cells that could be obtained in the 

development of the research, for its use by other researchers. 

e) When using oocytes or pre-embryos, the indication and justification of its size, origin and the 
document of the informed consent signed by the donors or progenitors respectively. 

4 

If yes, which body is in charge of the approval of hESC research (ethics review)? 

A)  For  researches  related  with  the  application  and  implementation  of  human  assisted 
reproductive techniques: the National Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction 
(art.  15.1,  d,  HARTAct)  “Comision  de  Garantías  para  la  Donación  y  Utilización  de 
Células y Tejidos Humanos” 

B)  For  researches  related  with  the  gain,  implementation  and  use  of  hESC  lines:  the 
Commission for Establishing Guarantees in the donation and use of human cells and 
tissues (art. 35 BMRAct) 

5 

In both cases the previous review by a local Research Ethics Committee is also needed. 
Is the creation of embryos for research purposes, or stem cells procurement, allowed 
in your country, if yes at what conditions? 
The new law explicitly prohibits the creation of pre-embryos and embryos for the exclusive 
use of research, although it permits the use of any other technique, including nuclear 
transfer, aimed to obtaining human embryonic stem cells for research or therapy (BMRAct): 
Article 33 Obtaining of embryonic cells 
1. The creation of human pre-embryos and embryos solely for experimentation purposes shall be 
prohibited. 
2. The use of any technique for obtaining human stem cells for therapeutic or research purposes shall 
be permitted, when it doesn’t entail the creation of a pre-embryo or embryo solely for  this purpose, in 
the terms provided in this Law, including the activation of oocytes through nuclear transfer.

3-approval by the ad hoc “Comision de Garantías para la Donación y Utilización de Células y 
Tejidos Humanos” 
(See on this previous answer to question Nr 4). 
 Does the relevant regulatory frame foresee informed consent procedures from 
individuals involved in embryo donation for research, if so could you please describe 
them? 
Yes. If embryos are going to be used for a research project, parents must sign an informed 
consent specific for that project. The informed consent form includes the name of the 
research project, a short summary of the main research objectives, the name of the IP and a 
disclosure of any financial interest (Art. 15.1, a of HARTAct).

Please list existing regulation applying to human embryonic stem cells (hESC) 
research (web address where to get the texts would be welcomed). 
The use of embryos to derive hES cell lines is regulated by the Human Fertilisation and 
Embryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK (www.hfea.gov.uk).  
The UK Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee also issues guidelines on the use of hES 
cell lines in the UK (www.ukstemcellbank.org.uk) 

Does the regulation provide a definition of 'embryo', if so which one? 
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (HF&E Act) 1990 provides that “an 
embryo means a live human embryo where fertilisation is complete, and references to 
an embryo include an egg in the process of fertilisation, and, for this purpose, 
fertilisation is not complete until the appearance of a two cell zygote”. 

Is hESC research allowed and in what terms and conditions? 
The HFEA regulates the use of embryos to derive hES cell lines. The use of hES cell 
lines in research is permitted in the UK but is not within the remit of the HFEA.  

If yes, which body is in charge of the approval of hESC research (ethics review)? 
The HFEA regulates the use of embryos to derive hES cell lines. 

Is the creation of embryos for research purposes, or stem cells procurement, 
allowed in your country, if yes at what conditions? 
Yes the creation of embryos for use in research, including the derivation of hES cell 
lines, is permitted in the UK. An explanation of how the HFEA licences research 
projects can be found on our website at www.hfea.gov.uk. 

Is the source of hESC used in research traceable and well documented? 
Yes 
 What are the formal ethical and legal requirements for hESC research approval? 
The use of embryos to derive hES cell lines requires a licence from the HFEA. 
The HFEA has set up a dedicated Research Licence Committee. Under section 
9(5) of the 1990 Act, a Licence Committee is required to include at least 1 member 
who is not authorised to carry on or participate in any activity under the authority 
of a licence and would not be so authorised if outstanding applications were 
granted. In addition to this requirement, and in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Better Regulation Task Force, the Research Licence 
Committee has a lay chair and a lay majority. 

In considering whether to grant or renew a licence, the Committee will have access to 
the following documentation: 

• 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Application form signed by the Person Responsible and the Nominal 
Licensee 
Curricula vitae of the principal personnel involved in the research 
Approval of a properly constituted local research Ethics Committee, 
Report of the inspection of the research centre 
Comments from 2 peer reviewers 
The centre’s licensing history

Patient Information and Consent Forms 

Before considering whether it is appropriate to grant or renew a licence the Research 
Licence Committee has to be satisfied that activities proposed in the licence application 
are necessary or desirable for one or more of the purposes set out in Schedule 2 to the 
HF&E Act 1990 (as amended by the Research Purposes Regulations 2001). In addition, 
the Research Licence Committee has to be satisfied that any proposed use of embryos 
is necessary for the purposes of the research. 

In addition the Research Licence Committee has to be satisfied that the character, 
qualifications and experience of the Person Responsible are such as are required to 
supervise the activities that s/he will discharge their duties under section 17 of the 
HF&E Act 1990 and that the premises where the research is to be carried out are 
suitable for the activities. 

To aid the Licence Committee in its consideration of research applications a decision 
making tool (the Decision Tree) which was formulated on the basis of legal advice and 
includes the statutory criteria that the Committee is required to consider.  

If the Licence Committee decides to grant or renew a licence, the Licence Committee 
will consider whether any conditions should be specified in the licence.

 Does the relevant regulatory frame foresee informed consent procedures from 
individuals involved in embryo donation for research, if so could you please 
describe them? 
The HFEA, as part of the licensing procedure, see and must approve the patient 
information and consent forms used in obtaining consent from patient donating gametes 
and / or embryos in licesend research projects. These documents must also be 
approved by a local research ethics committee.  
Furthermore, all research centres are inspected, by the HFEA, annually and as part of 
this process, the HFEA examines the process used by the centre in obtaining the

consent of patients whose gametes and / or embryos are used in licensed research.

 Is financial inducement allowed? If so, in what terms? 

Women will not be paid for donating their eggs. Researchers will have to follow the 
same system as donation for treatment.  

Non patient donors can only claim back the expenses that they have actually incurred 
i.e in money or money's worth, a donor may be given reasonable, demonstrable 
expenses which she has incurred, within the UK, in connection with the donation.  
Donors may be compensated for loss of earnings (but not for other costs or 
inconveniences) up to a daily maximum of £55.19 but with an overall limit of £250 (or 
the equivalent in local currency) for each cycle of egg donation. 

Patient participating in egg sharing schemes will be permitted to receive treatment 
services in exchange for sharing a proportion of the eggs collected.

 Are ad hoc data protection provisions be defined for hESC research? 
This is not within the remit of the HFEA 

Are data deriving from hESC projects necessarily provided, whether positive or 
negative (in form of publications)? 
This is not within the remit of the HFEA 

How is patenting of hESC lines regulated? 
This is not within the remit of the HFEA 

When clinical experiments are carried out, the Ethics Review Board must 

broaden its review to the research ethics questions and consider patients’ 

protective rights as laid down in the general medical ethics principles and 

guidelines. It may be necessary at that point to review these guidelines, as they 

are based upon the current status quo in human embryonic stem cell research.

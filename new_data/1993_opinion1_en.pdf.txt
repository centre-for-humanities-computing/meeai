Performance-enhancers  manufactured  using  biotechnology  are  administered  to
animals and fish in their feed or by techniques such as injection or implantation, on
a regular basis or over a period to stimulate their productivity and/or improve the
ratio of meat to fat.

Bovine  somatotropine  (BST)  or  bovine  growth  hormone  is  one  of  these
performance-enhancers. This involves a hormonal protein produced by the pituitary
gland  wich  stimulates  not  only  bone  growth  and  protein  anabolism,  but  also
galactopoesis (increase in milk secretion during lactation shown in cattle). BST can
currently be produced  by genetic engineering on an industrial scale.

In the Second Commission Report on bovine somatotropine of 21 January 19921,
the Commission outlines current data on BST assessment and invites the Advisory
Group  on  biotechnology  ethics  to  form  an  opinion  on  the  ethical  consequences
which may result from the administration  of  growth  promoters  in  agriculture  and
fisheries.

Currently,  four  American  pharmaceutical  companies  (American  Cyanamid,  Eli
Lilly, Monsanto, UpJohn) are in a position to market BST  and have applied to the
American and European authorities for authorization.

Some  countries  have  authorized  its  use  (Mexico,  the  former  USSR,  Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria, South Africa, Nambia and Zimbabwa). However, no authorization has been given
to date in the Member States, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, Switzerland
or the Scandinavian countries.

Under  Directive  87/22/EEC,  applications  for  authorization  to  place  veterinary
medicinal  products  on  the  market  manufactured  using  biotechnology  must  be
submitted  for  opinion  to  the  Committee  on  Veterinary  Medicinal  Products
(CMVP),  before  a  final  decision  can  be  adopted  at  national  level  on  the
authorization of the product in question.  These opinions are delivered on the basis
of objective scientific criteria of quality, safety and the efficacy of the product, and
not any economic or other consideration2.

So far the CMVP has delivered an opinion on two applications: in March 1991 on
the  application  submitted  by  Monsanto  for  "Somatech";  in  December  1991,  the
Committee delivered a public opinion in the form of a statement on the application
submitted by Eli Lilly for "Optiflex 640". From the point of view of safety, quality
and efficacy both products are apparently  considered  to be satisfactory. However,
some  Member  States  think  no  satisfactory  answer  has  been  given  to  questions
concerning the  possibility of an increased  incidence  of  mastilis  and inflammatory
reactions at the site of injection among dairy cows treated with BST3.

At  present  the  CMVP  consultation  procedure  has  been  suspended  as  the  Council
has  intervened  to  prohibit  the  use  of  BST  in  the  Community  until  31  December
1993 pending the results of the current studies on the effects and consequences of
this product - in particular from the point of view of health and animal welfare4.

The  Group  is  aware  of  the  fact  that  among  the  various  aspects  to  be  taken  into
consideration  in  deciding  for  or  against  the  use  of  BST,  economic  and  political
arguments play a major role, such as the advisability or not of an increase in milk
production  in  Europe  and  the  possible  exploitation  of  the  European  market  by
American pharmaceutical firms.

The Group is also aware of the fact that European needs cannot be seen in Isolation
from the needs of the rest of the world and yet that the european market must be
considered in a realistic light.

However,  the  Group  considered  that  such  problems  go  beyond  its  terms  of
reference, since they are not ethical problems in a narrow sense.

The ethical considerations relevant to the use of BST fell into four categories.

2.2.1 Human health and safety

Two kinds of fears have been expressed:

-

-

The US General Accounting Office finds that the use of BST is
associated  with  the  frequency  of  bovine  mastitis,  against  which
antibiotics  are  administered.  The  antibiotic  concentration  in  milk
and  in  beef  or  veal  could  be  a  risk  factor  (indeterminate)  for
consumer’s health.

Somatic  cells  in  the  milk  produced  using  BST  could  be  excessive
and damaging to consumers.

2.2.2 Animal welfare

The use of BST or medication subsequently administered on animals could
lead to pain or discomfort for these animals which is disproportionate to the
human good expected from the use of the product.

2.2.3 Freedom of choice of the consumer

Concern  has  been  expressed  about  the  freedom  of  consumers  to  choose
between BST treated milk ans other milk.

2.2.4 Biological diversity

The fear has been expressed that the use of BST on selected subgroups of
animals could be harmful to the biodiversity of the species involved.

The  following  opinion  was  expressed  with  respect  to  the  above  listed  Ethical
Aspects:

Mastitis and other inflammatory reactions are caused not peculiarly by BST
but by high yield of lactation wether brought about by BST or by selective
breeding.  Milk  derived  from  animals  treated  with  antibiotics  for  mastitis
and  other 
inflammatory  reactions  should  be  banned  from  human
consumption for as long as required for the drug to be totally absent. Such a
requirement would favor the practice- which is by itself sufficient to solve
the problem- of controlling animal infections through the mere observance
of drug free hygienic measures.  In addition, it has to be pointed out that a
high-yield lactation can be stopped at will by removal of the drug in BST-
treated  animals,  but  it  is  irreversible  in  animals  which  are  the  result  of
selective breeding.

The  problem  about  a  possible,  yet  unproven,  unhealthy  effect  of  an
excessive  number  of  somatic  cells  in  milk  produced  by  high-yield
lactation animals  (again  regardless  of  the  technique  applied  for  their
production,  i.e.  BST  treatment  or  selective  breeding)  can  be  easily
level  of  somatic  cells  acceptable  per
settled by fixing  a 
millilitre of milk  such  as  the  one  already  observed  for  the  milk  of  high-
yield lactation cows obtained through selective breeding.

The Group considers that though it is ethically acceptable for humans to use
animals for good  human  ends,  they must not treat them with indifference,
and  thus  any  drug  or  procedure  likely  to  induce  severe  or  enduring  pain
should not be authorized.

The  Group  thinks  that  the  freedom  of  choice  of  the  consumer  will  be
guaranteed once it is possible to detect BST traces in milk and it is labeled
as BST-treated milk.

The  Group  concludes 
inducing  high-yield
lactation through  drug-induced  treatment  is  expected  to  safeguard  the
preservation  of  Biological  Diversity  if  applied  judiciously  i.e.  to  improve
the performance of all domesticated breeds of animals. On the contrary, the
persistent  application  of  intensive  selective  breeding  in  favor  of  the
phenotypical trait in question with or without BST, could not only lead to
general  loss  of  genetic  heterogeneity,  but  -in  the  long  run-  also  to  the
deterioration of the desired phenotypical feature itself, as a result of the well
known  irreversible  accumulation  of  homozygosity  brought  about  by
protracted  inbreeding.    Thus  the  Group  considers  that  on  the  basis  of  the
data available the use of BST as such will not threaten Biological Diversity.

(cid:23)(cid:17)

5(&200(1’$7,21

The Group  concludes  that  the  use  of  BST  to  increase  lactation  in  cows  is
ethically  unobjectionable,  and  safe  for  both  human  and  animals,  provided
that the following measures are adopted:

(cid:23)(cid:17)(cid:20)

(cid:23)(cid:17)(cid:22)

(cid:23)(cid:17)(cid:23)

(cid:23)(cid:17)(cid:24)

assurance should be provided that BST-treated animals do not suffer
extreme  pain  or  even  discomfort  that  is  disproportionate  to  the
human good expected from the use of the product;

treatment  should  be  stopped  when  increased  lactation  of  milk  is
associated with mastitis or other inflammatory reactions;

these  reactions  should  be  controlled  through  the  application  of
simple  hygienic  measures  or  -if  cured  with  antibiotics-  the  milk
produced  by  the  animals  so  treated  should  be  banned  from  human
consumption until the antibiotics are totally eliminated;

the level of somatic cells per millilitre of milk should not be higher
than the concentration found in the milk thus far produced by high-
yield lactation cows obtained through selective breeding;

if it becomes possible to distinguish milk derived from BST- treated
cows from other milk, then the vendors should be required to label
it and its derivatives to allow free choice to the buyers.

Besides  these  ethical  aspects,  the  question  o  marketing  or  non-marketing  BST  in
the European Community is mainly a political issue which should be discussed as
such.  In this context, the effects of BST on evolution of agricultural structures, as
well as consumer’s reactions should be taken into account in the appropriate forum
when the relevant data is available.

In accordance with its terms of reference, the Group of Advisers on Ethical Aspects
of Biotechnology submits this Recommendation to the Commission.

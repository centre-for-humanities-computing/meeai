Scope of the Opinion

On 28 June 2011 the Council reached a political agree-
ment on a Commission proposal for a nuclear research 
and training programme for 2012–13. Although the 
Council’s discussion has been successfully concluded, 
some Member States felt that a broad discourse on 
ethical issues and sustainable energy mix in Europe 
should take place and indicated the need of having an 
Opinion of the European Group on Ethics in Science 
and New Technologies (EGE) on this topic. On 19 De-
cember 2011, the President of the European Commis-
sion requested the EGE to ‘contribute to the debate 
on a sustainable energy mix in Europe by studying the 
ethical impact of research on different energy sources 
on human well-being.’

The EGE has accepted this request and decided to focus 
on the ethical aspects of the use of different energy 
sources in Europe, as foreseen in the EGE remit (74). The 
group recognises the need to consider issues such as 
security of supply, storage of energy where necessary 
due to the nature of electricity generation particularly 
where intermittent sources are utilised, competition for 
water and food in the case of biofuels, waste treatment 
and/or storage and pollution. The Group decided:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

to address the ethical issues arising from energy use 
within the EU energy agenda, mix of energy, con-
sequences for the future, energy policy and regula-
tion (including environmental considerations), pre-
cautionary principle, and intergenerational justice;

to identify the ethical criteria on the manner in 
which decisions concerning research on sources of 
energy (in view of the Council’s decision) are to be 
taken on an informed basis and the implications 
arising from the use of energy in different areas;

to propose an integrated ethics framework for the 
purpose of addressing the ethical issues related to 
the production, use, storage and distribution of 
energy;

to identify the ethically relevant areas of energy 
research.

(74)  The role of the EGE is to provide the Commission with high-
quality and independent advice on ethical aspects of sci-
ence and new technologies in connection with the prepara-
tion and implementation of Union legislation or policies.

1.  Scientific aspects

1.1 

Introduction

Before the discovery of the ability to control external 
sources of energy, humans simply used the energy 
that they could develop through their own bodies. 
The control of fire (enshrined in myth in the story of 
Prometheus) has always been considered as a turning 
point for human societies. Fire was procured by burn-
ing plant material such as wood or grasses and was 
used by prehistoric people, maybe even by ancestral 
hominids thousands of years ago, for many purposes 
such as cooking food, protection from other animals, 
keeping warm, seeing in the dark and producing new 
materials such as pottery, which, in turn, lead to the 
smelting of metals.

In historical times, human societies learned to use the 
energy of animals such as horses or camels for farm 
work and transport. To these sources, humans added 
the use of wind energy from windmills or water energy 
produced in river mills. All these systems use solar en-
ergy converted into chemical and mechanical energy 
by plants and animals or through rain and wind. Many 
cultures were able to use heat from thermal sources 
that produce water heated by the internal energy of 
the planet, the only initial energy source not directly 
originating from solar energy.

Energy needs have increased enormously and, due to 
the rapid growth in populations, to industrialisation 
and urbanisation, they have changed the way we 
interact with our environment. The massive extension 
in our use of electronics in our daily lives increases 
the need for energy in a manner not foreseen in the 
20th century! In addition, energy use per person in the 
developing world is increasing towards that used by 
those in developed countries.

The most important change in our use of energy took 
place in the 18th century (Figure 1) when the steam 
engine was developed to allow energy production that 
depended only on the availability of a fuel that rap-
idly became mined coal. The steam engine changed 
the world; as a result of industrialisation, people in-
teracted differently with their environment and there 
was a greater need for fuel and food, which had to be 
transported to where people now lived.

The availability of affordable and transportable en ergy 
sustained the Industrial Revolution. Human beings 
have always needed two forms of energy: that used 
in a static system, in our homes for heating, cooking, 
lighting and (today) cooling, and that used for trans-
port, initially animals, then steam engines, and, now, 
public and private transport based on the internal 
combustion engine, including aircrafts. The manner in 
which these are provided to individual homes and busi-
nesses differ: hence, the needs have to be addressed 
somewhat differently. Coal, for example, is heavy, not 
suitable for most forms of private transport. Electricity 
can be used in transport if power cables can be pro-
vided (in public transport, for example, for trains and 
trams) or if mechanisms for storage are available, for 
example batteries, flywheels and/or fuel cells.

Coal is fossilised wood accumulated in soil in large 
quantities. Coal rapidly became a strategic product. 
Coal mines were the basis of the industrial revolution 
that developed through the 19th century in Europe and 
North America and its availability provided the impetus 
to develop new types of engines for use in transport. 
Ships and trains powered by coal transformed world 
trade. Coal mines had an important social impact in 
the  European  regions  where  mines  were  located. 
A new culture of miner societies appeared during

the 19th century that had implications on European 
trade union culture, because of the need to support 
one another in a dangerous environment. During the 
20th century, the decreasing use of coal of European 
origin and the consequent closure of mines has created 
social disruptions that are still reverberating in Euro-
pean regions with coal mining traditions.

Coal was initially used for heating and distributed to 
homes using traditional transport. The gas produced 
from coal through a distillation process was the first 
easily transportable energy system that could be dis-
tributed for lighting in cities and to houses for heating, 
and even stored for use in transport. The first grids for 
distributing energy were those put in place to distrib-
ute coal gas. Electric current, discovered in the first half 
of the 19th century, became the primary source of en-
ergy that could be distributed for use everywhere. The 
first power plants were built in Europe and in the Unit-
ed States in 1882 and were powered by steam engines 
burning coal, and, even today, coal is the major fuel 
powering generators for electricity. At the end of the 
19th century, the use of petrol became the dominant 
source of energy. Petrol has been known since antiq-
uity but the possibility to drill underground wells deep 
enough to obtain large quantities of oil, and to refine it 
to obtain petrol and other products, produced a new 
type of industry that has dominated the 20th century. 
Natural gas first appeared as a by-product of oil pro-
duction and it soon became a new source of energy 
in itself.

Energy use is increasing at an accelerating rate and 
reached 550 exajoules in 2010. One important effect of 
the increasing use of energy is the development of new 
industries that are involved in the processes related to 
the production and distribution of energy. Compa-
nies that prospect and extract coal, oil and gas, refine 
fuels and prepare petrochemicals and transport and 
distribute fluid fuels have become the largest world 
companies. There are also companies that produce 
and distribute electricity as well as those that manage 
the large electricity grids; to these can be added the 
companies that build power plants to produce electric-
ity from different fuel sources, including nuclear. Many 
of these companies are, or were, State-controlled. The 
energy sector in Europe is one of the most powerful 
industrial sectors, accounting for 9 % of total European 
industry and 3 % of the total industrial workforce.

The European project that has produced the European 
Union started as a community of states that intend-
ed to share their sources of energy, and the knowl-
edge to produce it. The founding treaties included 
the European Coal and Steel Community (1951) and 
Euratom (1957).

At the beginning of the 21st century, humankind is us-
ing an average of 25 times the energy that humans use 
as food energy to survive. Our society and the well-
being of citizens in the developed world depend, es-
sentially, on the availability of energy.

Energy is used for a large number of purposes: heat-
ing, transportation, industry, and all services that de-
pend on the availability of electricity. Countries have 
a specific distribution of uses that varies depending on 
their needs (e.g. heating needs in cold countries are 
different from those in warmer countries) and on their 
economic structure (e.g. highly industrialised countries 
use more energy for manufacturing). Modern agricul-
ture depends on energy, which means that sustaining 
the rapidly increasing population of the world is heav-
ily dependent on affordable energy. New electronic 
systems, such as the Internet and cloud computing, 
are voracious users of energy. It has been suggested 
that simply reducing energy provision to about 1 600 
kilowatts per individual per year (75) would reduce life 
expectancy by half to about 36.5 years!

1.2  Current sources of energy

The available sources of energy can be summarised as 
follows.

Sources of solar origin

The main source of energy that we use directly or in-
directly is the radiation that earth receives from the sun. 
However, a large part of this energy is radiated back 
into space or absorbed by the atmosphere, and our sys-
tems to transform the energy once it arrives on earth’s 
surface have low conversion rates into other forms of 
energy. Plants, for example, are able to convert around 
1 % of the solar energy they receive into chemical en-
ergy in the form of sugars through the process of photo-
synthesis. It is possible to use solar radiation directly 
either by converting radiation into heat or electricity:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

thermosolar: solar radiation is used to heat a mate-
rial which has a high thermal conductivity, normally 
water, and the warm fluid is used either for heating 
or to produce electricity;

(cid:116)(cid:1) photovoltaic: solar radiation is captured using the 
photovoltaic effect to produce electricity directly.

Figure 1.2.1: Earth’s energy budget

In both cases, the production of electricity depends on 
the availability of solar energy that varies during the 
day, from one day to another, and in different parts of 
the world.

Solar radiation is the indirect origin of many different 
types of energy through the heating of air and evapora-
tion of water that results in rainfall. These sources are 
used to produce electricity.

Waterfalls and water currents: Hydroelectric power 
is used to produce electricity in much of the world. It 
generally requires storing water in reservoirs: the water 
is then released through turbines that generate elec-
tricity. Water currents in rivers or in the sea could also 
be used for the production of energy but these are es-
sentially at the research stage.

Windmills: The power of the wind produces move-
ment of rotors that in turn are used to produce elec-
tricity. The energy contained in the movement of air 
on windy days has been captured for centuries. The 
most common form of capture has been sails on ships, 
but windmills have been used for mechanical power 
for milling or for pumping water (or oil). Wind turbines 
may be used to produce electricity and improvements 
in the technology during the last few years mean that

the worldwide wind capacity reached 254 000 MW by 
the end of June 2012, out of which 16 546 MW were 
added in the first 6 months of 2012 (76).

Biofuels and biomass: Plant material from cultivated 
crops or from plant residues not used for food or feed 
can be burned to produce electricity or used to pro-
duce liquid fuels through fermentation. Algal culture 
may also be used for biofuel production.

Biogas: Methane may be produced from fermentation of 
organic (plant and animal) residues, to produce electric-
ity or used as a gas for transportable fuels.

Solar energy concentrated by microorganisms 
and plants in geological periods

non-renewable. Nuclear fusion energy, the origin of so-
lar energy, would make use of much more abundant ma-
terials but it is not presently a controlled energy source. In 
theory, a vast amount of energy could be produced from 
the fusion of light nuclei but this technology remains at 
a research stage.

Coal: Coal is the product of fossilised plants that have 
accumulated during hundreds of millions of years and 
have been transformed through geological processes. 
Coal is burned either to produce electricity or for heating.

Gas: Natural gas is essentially methane produced from 
massive quantities of photosynthetic microorganisms 
that have been transformed through geological process-
es. Natural gas is used to produce electricity, or directly 
for heating and transport.

Petroleum: Petroleum is the product of large masses of 
photosynthetic microorganisms that have sedimented 
during millions of years and have been transformed 
through geological processes. It is used to produce fuel 
for transportation, heating and electricity. It is also an 
important source for many chemical products such as 
plastics, fibres and pharmaceuticals. It can be found in 
large quantities in defined locations on the planet.

These sources are the main sources of energy supply in 
the world; they have a high energy content and a number 
of complex and efficient systems have been developed to 
make use of them. As these sources are the consequence 
of the fixation of energy by organisms in the past millions 
of years, they are, by definition, limited in quantity and 
their use depletes the resource. The estimations of existing 
reserves of petrol, gas and coal vary considerably: these 
reserves are non-renewable resources produced over 
millions of years, and current production is not significant.

Sources of energy remaining from 
the origin of the planet

Geothermal: Geothermal energy is normally collected 
from water at high temperature from natural sources. 
The internal heat of the planet can also be used to heat 
a fluid. This type of energy is used for heating and for the 
production of electricity.

Nuclear energy: Nuclear energy is currently produced 
from the fission of heavy isotopes such as uranium or 
thorium and used to produce electricity. Nuclear fis-
sion energy depends on the availability of fissile ele-
ments that have to be extracted in mines and, hence, 
they, too, are limited in quantity and can be considered 

Other sources

Tidal energy: The movement of water in tidal systems or 
in rivers is captured using turbines to produce electricity. 
It is used to produce electricity in coastal regions where 
tides are sufficient to make these systems economically 
viable. The same principle can be applied to the move-
ment of water in rivers.

Renewable and non-renewable energy sources

Some types of energy have their origin (directly or in-
directly) in the energy of the sun that arrives continuously 
at the surface of our planet or in the internal heat of the 
planet. We do not expect these sources of energy to 
decrease in the foreseeable future. For this reason, the 
energy obtained in this way is continuously renewed. 
That is the reason why we consider energy from direct 
(i.e. thermosolar, photovoltaic) or indirect (i.e. wind, sea 
currents, hydraulic or biofuels) solar origin and from the 
internal energy of the planet (geothermal) as renewable. 
Energy from those sources that were accumulated in pre-
vious periods of the planet’s history and that are present 
in fixed quantities will be exhausted at some time in the 
future: for this reason, coal, petrol and gas are categorised 
as non-renewable. This is also the case for nuclear en-
ergy obtained from fission because reserves of uranium 
(in particular) are also limited.

The key issue as regards non-renewable sources of en-
ergy is that reserves will be depleted at some point and 
our society has to prepare itself to rely on sources of en-
ergy that will not be exhausted. Estimates of the reserves 
of fossil fuels, and even of uranium needed to drive nu-
clear power plants, vary widely, depending on new re-
serves being identified or the politics of those making 
the estimates. Although it has been proposed that the 
maximum of some fossil energies (peak oil point) may be 
reached in this century, technology has been developed 
to obtain petroleum and gas from wells at great depths 
under the sea, in polar regions and in places where they 
are distributed in large volumes (shale oil and shale gas) 
which are becoming accessible through changes in 
mining technologies. These technologies increase the 
reserves of fossil fuels that may be available, although 
at high economic and/or environmental costs. It is, 

23

Nevertheless, fracking provides a huge, relatively un-
tapped until recently, source of hydrocarbon fuels that 
alleviate the scarcity of gas and petroleum products. 
The use of fracking and other unconventional sources 
of fossil fuels has meant that the United States is once 
again exporting these fuels, having been a net import-
er until fairly recently. The use of shale gas has been 
discussed in many European countries and a number 
of reports have been published on this subject; for ex-
ample, the recent report by the Royal Society and the 
Royal Academy of Engineering in the United Kingdom 
where a number of recommendations on their use are 
proposed (77).

1 | SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS

therefore, necessary to decrease the use of non-renew-
able fuels through the adoption of renewable sources 
as soon as possible in order to slow down the depletion 
of these resources. At the same time, a number of devel-
opments can be used as bridge technologies to allow 
access to adequate levels of energy from the existing 
present situation until renewable sources account for 
the majority of the energy used in our societies.

Fracking

Exploitable reserves of fossil fuels have been increased 
dramatically due to the possibility of using the so-called 
unconventional sources that include shale gas and shale 
oil but also tar sands, extra heavy oil or gas hydrates. 
Shale gas is a natural gas (predominantly methane) dis-
tributed in some types of rocks and that, in some cases, is 
extracted by the process of hydraulic fracturing or ‘frack-
ing’. It involves drilling a deep hole in the dense shale 
rocks that contain natural gas and then pumping vast 
quantities of water mixed with sand and chemicals into 
it at very high pressure. This opens up tiny fissures in the 
rock, through which the trapped gas can then escape. 
It bubbles out and is captured in wells that bring it to 
the surface, where it can be piped off. The effects of its 
extraction on water pollution and on the emission of 
methane to the atmosphere have been shown and they 
have been a matter of concern.

SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS | 1

The energy mix used varies in space and in time. It is 
not the same in different European countries and it 
changes with time.

Most European countries import the major part of the 
energy they use. This creates a significant an important 
imbalance in the economy of these countries, trans-
fers large amounts of money to energy-rich countries 
and creates a dependence on countries that may be in 
politically unstable regions of the world.

1.3  Different sources of energy undergo 

(cid:1)

complex cycles

The energy that we presently use in industry, at home 
or for transportation has to be transformed from the 
different sources available, transported to where it 
is needed and used for many different purposes. In 
particular, some types of energy may be for static 
uses such as domestic and industrial use or dynamic 
uses such as transportation. The requirements in both 
cases may be very different, in particular regarding 
the place where the energy is produced and the 
manner in which it is distributed. During all these 
processes, the energy cycle from production to use 
may need specific investment, may create social prob-
lems, risks to populations, and may produce residues 
that have to be disposed of. All these aspects have to 
be considered for each type of energy in order to be 
aware of the effects of using energy from different 
sources.

countries, Eurostat (2008).

Energy production

Hydraulic energy can only be produced where there 
are strong water currents or a sufficient drop in water 
level and may need the construction of a dam to con-
trol the energy production process. That means that 
some territory may have to be flooded, resulting in 
environmental or social effects. Reservoirs usually al-
low the continuous production of electricity except in 
periods of serious droughts. They are normally some 
distance from urban and industrial areas and risks of 
accidents for populations downstream exist. Some ter-
ritories may be subject to floods, resulting in environ-
mental or social effects. On the other hand, dams may 
also prevent flooding.

Windmills are preferentially constructed in places 
where strong winds exist. They may have environ-
mental or social effects (e.g. visual impact) and are 
noisy, may interfere with bird migration, and their 
construction needs specific metal products (which 
require en ergy to produce). They are normally some 
distance from urban or industrial areas and produc-
tion of electricity depends on the strength of the wind.

Thermosolar and photovoltaic panels are preferen-
tially constructed in places with solar irradiation that is, 
by definition, irregular through the day and night, and 
seasonally. They may be integrated into buildings or 
be concentrated in specific places. Photovoltaic panel 
construction uses scarce metal products.

Biofuels and biomass are produced from cultivated 
plants or algae that have made use of photosynthesis 
to transform solar energy into chemical energy. This 
was probably the first source of energy — burning 
wood. Processing is needed to produce efficient fuels 
(ethanol or a diesel oil equivalent). Present (first-gen-
eration) sources are crops such as maize, sugar cane, 
rapeseed and soybean that are diverted from food 
production. Biomass from forest, domestic or industri-
al waste can also be used. Present biofuel production 
may compete with food uses and the energy balance 
may not be clear. These are often called first-genera-
tion biofuels. Second-generation biofuels would make 
use of the transformation of the lignocellulose present 
in plants into its component sugars and then to etha-
nol or other liquid fuels. Fuels from microalgae, also 
often called third-generation biofuels, would mimic 
the original process of petrol production but, at pre-
sent, the costs and energy balances are still not well 
established.

Geothermal and tidal systems are only possible at very 
specific places in the world. They may have environmen-
tal impacts and they are usually distant from urban or 
industrial users.

Coal, petrol and gas have to be obtained from places 
where they exist in mines or by underground or under-
water drilling. Recently, gas and petrol have been ob-
tained in distributed materials such as oil sands and 
shale gas formations. The extraction procedures may 
have a strong environmental impact and they have the 
risk of accidents. All these materials are found in spe-
cific regions of the world. Europe has coal reserves, but 
few reserves of petrol and gas, thus being dependent 
on imports.

Transport

Many sources of energy are distant from industrial or 
domestic users and, therefore, the energy has to be 
transported. Methods of transporting energy include 
physical transport such as coal, petrol or gas by means 
of ships or trucks or, in the case of fluid sources, by the 
use of gas ducts or oleo ducts. Gas can be transported 
directly to houses or industries. All these systems may 
have important geopolitical implications and they are 
prone to accidents.

Electricity is transported making use of metal cables. 
Electricity networks are presently a key element in the 
distribution of energy. They have an important visual im-
pact and they may produce accidents in some areas. Dis-
tribution of electricity, but also of gas and petrol, gives 
rise to systems of transport (energy grids) that are in-
creasingly important to compensate energy production 
and demand in different locations.

The grid

Where once energy was distributed within small com-
munities, as urbanisation has increased, the need to 
provide energy within large conurbations has become 
a necessity. Gas and electricity are distributed to com-
merce, industry and consumers, and national and interna-
tional grids are being developed to provide both gas and 
electricity where needed and to even out fluctuations in 
use. At the moment, electricity is generated by a small 
number of power stations placed as near as possible to 
the ‘mines’ where the fuel is produced (if coal powered). 
Where, only recently, coal mines were being closed as 
gas- and oil-powered energy generation were deemed fi-
nancially and environmentally more effective, coal is once

again becoming important. Production of shale gas 
in the United States means that coal prices are falling, 
and coal has climbed from about 25 % to 30 % of the 
global share of primary energy production) (78).

The generated electricity is then transported at high 
voltages to end-users via a distribution network — 
a grid. The electricity is transformed to lower voltages 
and distributed to individual businesses and homes via 
a secondary grid. Gas is distributed via a vast network 
of pipelines. For example, gas is distributed through 
nearly 300 000 km of pipes in the United Kingdom. In 
addition, gas is transported across continents through 
pipelines that enable its use thousands of kilometres 
from the drilling sites. There is likely to be a greater reli-
ance on ‘smart grids’ and ‘distributed grids’ that cross 
international boundaries in the future; these grids 
provide stability to the systems, if designed in an ef-
fective manner. The dilemma of an increased demand 
for energy not being balanced by energy-generation 
resources requires new ways of addressing energy 
needs.

Figure 1.3.1: Averaged solar radiation 1994–2004

Domestic and commercial users are becoming aware 
of both the cost of energy and the need to save energy 
effectively. Users could become ‘smart clients’ produc-
ing energy to add to the grid or consuming energy 
when their own generation capability is less than 
their needs. In addition, the grids need to cope with 
an increasing trend towards decentralised generation 
systems that are volatile producers (e.g. dependent on 
sunlight or wind) that feed into the energy grids: there 
is a need to store energy at times of overproduction 
for use when demand exceeds generation capacity.

A smart grid is an energy distribution system or network 
that is designed to monitor use and adjust to changing 
conditions automatically. These new smart grids deliver 
power by automatically re-routing where necessary, 
shift-ing loads and managing generation so as to deliver 
power where and when it is needed. The smart grids 
enable the development of energy generation systems 
near to where they are required, and microgeneration 
is becoming a manageable asset — where consumers 
generate their own electricity and add it to the grid.

that has a major impact in taking decisions on the use 
of this energy source.

Thermosolar and photovoltaic panels and windmills 
may be placed in or on buildings or near areas where 
energy is needed, but have the disadvantage that 
the energy needs to be stored in some way. Engines 
and heating from coal, gas or petrol are distributed 
through specific systems or grids. Biogas can also be 
used or converted in the proximity of users. All these 
systems constitute a distributed system of energy 
production that may contribute to the production of 
energy as a whole if adequate grids are available. In 
this case, the design of buildings that incorporate not 
only systems that reduce the use of energy but that 
also produce energy may be an interesting factor in 
reducing the transport of energy for urban use.

A major problem with electricity generation is that 
demand fluctuates with time and place. Storing elec-
tricity when an excess is generated presents a prob-
lem; hence, the usual solution is to attempt to balance 
demand and generation in real time. New renewable 
sources, however, make the balancing act impossible 
and storage becomes essential.

In the case of gas, storage is much easier, although 
storage capacity and, hence, security of supply create 
problems.

Electricity production

Electricity production can be concentrated in power 
plants where coal, fuel from petrol or gas, and bio-
mass are burned to produce heat that is then used to 
produce electricity. The present level of efficiency and 
safety of electricity production depends on the type 
of power plants and the fuel used.

Electricity can also be produced in nuclear plants. 
They constantly produce electricity except when acci-
dents occur or revisions are needed and production is 
stopped. Specific risks from the escape of radioactiv-
ity in accidents have been demonstrated. Accidents in 
nuclear power plants, in particular those of Chernobyl 
and Fukushima, have had important impacts on the 
European perception of the safety of these systems. 
Thus, the perceived risk of nuclear accidents is a factor

Residues

An important concern in energy generation is the resi-
dues that are produced. They can be separated into 
various types. Particles and gases are produced by and 
during fuel combustion. The burning of coal, biomass 
and some fuels derived from petrol produce particles 
that may have important health effects. It has been 
shown that this is especially important in primitive 
types of ovens but also in the case of coal, petrol and 
diesel engines. Burning coal or petroleum products is 
a major source of pollution, producing environmental 
effects such as photochemical smog. In 1306, concerns 
over air pollution were sufficient for the English King 
Edward I to (briefly) ban coal fires in London! Efforts 
during the 20th century efficiently reduced such effects 
in cities such as London.

The production of energy using traditional fuels results 
in the emission to the atmosphere of gases such as car-
bon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and methane, which are 
the important factors producing greenhouse effects 
and, therefore, actors in climate change. Any type of 
combustion of carbon-containing fuel such as coal, 
gas, petrol derivatives or biofuels produces carbon 
dioxide. The correlation of this continued production 
with the increase in the global temperature has been 
shown to drive climate change that has unequivocally 
been shown to have global effects that have become 
a major environmental concern. For this reason, re-
duction in carbon dioxide and methane emissions has 
become a priority. This may be achieved through the 
use of the so-called low-carbon technologies that use 
low proportions of fossil fuels (including some form of 
carbon capture). Methods to attempt a reduction of 
these effects through carbon dioxide sequestration 
are actively being investigated but no system has been 
shown to be efficient in the reduction of greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere.

The main reason for concern at the use of fission for 
energy production is the long life of the residues and 
waste materials and, hence, the danger to humans and 
the environment over an immensely long timescale. 
The timescale for environmental and human (health) 
damage from coal or oil is not as obvious, although 
climate change provides similar problems in terms of 
length. The production of electricity in nuclear power 
plants gives rise to radioactive waste (i.e. material 
with high radioactivity) and, importantly, this waste 
may have a lifetime of thousands of years — and no 
system exists to recycle it. It must, therefore, be dis-
posed of in controlled sites that have to be maintained 

‘safe’ for a very long time. Even the combustion of coal 
releases significant amounts of radioactivity into the 
atmosphere annually.

Efficiency

Energy is defined as the ability to perform work and 
classical physics has affirmed the principle of conser-
vation of energy that states that energy is not created 
nor destroyed but only transformed. This means that 
all the processes described here are only processes of 
transformation of energy from one form to another. 
The question is: How efficient are these processes of 
transformation? Some forms of energy are useful to 
perform the kind of work desired while other ones 
may be considered wasteful. Electricity production 
from the chemical energy contained in coal or fuel in 
power plants has greatly increased in efficiency, meas-
ured as the proportion of chemical energy that is finally 
converted into electrical energy, a part of which will be 
lost during transport. An example of waste is the heat 
lost during this process or that which is finally dispersed 
into the environment.

1.4  EU research

The technologies used for the production, transport, 
storage and treatment of residues are rapidly evolving 
and Europe has always been at the forefront of research 
in these technologies. For this reason, the European 
Union has always had an important chapter on energy 
in the funds for R & D ( 80). A summary of these funds 
follows where the funds attributed to research in fu-
sion energy, atomic energy, and renewable energy are 
presented. Funds for research in nuclear fusion are 
especially important because of the ITER programme 
(originally, International Thermonuclear Experimental 
Reactor). The ITER programme is the largest world in-
vestment that could lead to the construction of a pow-
er plant producing electricity from fusion. According 
to the information provided by the European Commis-
sion, the main energy sectors being addressed by the 
EU in its research programmes are the following.

1.4.1 

Research in nuclear fusion

Inside the sun, fusion reactions take place at very 
high temperatures (around 15 million °C) and un -
der enormous gravitational pressures. At such high 

(80)  Data is available online (http://ec.europa.eu/research/

energy/eu/research/index_en.htm).

temperatures, gas becomes plasma. Plasma is the 
fourth state of matter (solid, liquid and gas being the 
other three) and is best described as an electrically 
charged gas. In plasma, the negatively charged elec-
trons in the gas atoms are completely split off from 
the positively charged atomic nuclei (or ions). The sun 
is a massive fusion power station. It produces around 
300 billion billion watts (3 × 1026) of power, consum-
ing 600 million tonnes of hydrogen fuel every second. 
The sun burns hydrogen gas — the simplest atomic nu-
cleus consisting of a single proton (a positively charged 
atomic particle).

Scientists and engineers are working to reproduce fu-
sion on a small scale. However, this is a significant scien-
tific and technical challenge. The earth does not have 
the gravitational pressure of the sun so plasma must be 
confined and heated to temperatures 10 times higher 
than those in the sun in order to get a sufficient num-
ber of fusion reactions. Making fusion work on earth 
requires two heavier types (or isotopes) of hydrogen: 
deuterium — with a nucleus of one proton and one 
neutron (an atomic particle with similar mass to the 
proton but no electrical charge) — and tritium (with 
one proton and two neutrons). When these two nuclei 
fuse together, they produce a new helium nucleus (also 
known as an alpha particle) and a high-energy neu-
tron. In a future fusion power plant, the energy of that 
neutron will be captured and used to heat steam to 
generate electricity as in a normal power station, while 
the electrically charged alpha particle will transfer its 
energy to the plasma, keeping it hot and maintaining 
the reaction. The raw fuels for fusion are water and lithi-
um (81). The fusion fuels are not radioactive (82) and have 

(81)  There is around 0.033 g of deuterium in every litre of water. 
Tritium is not found on earth but can be easily made from 
lithium — an abundant metal found in the batteries that 
power mobile phones and laptops. Tritium can be made in 
situ in a fusion reactor by using the neutron released by the 
fusion reaction. If the neutron is absorbed by a surrounding 
‘blanket’ of lithium, tritium is produced.

(82)  The volume of gas in a fusion reactor will always be low, 
at around 1 g of fuel in 1 000 m3. Any problem will always 
cool the plasma and stop reactions — so a runaway situa-
tion is impossible. Furthermore, the raw fuels for the reac-
tor (deuterium and lithium) are not radioactive. Tritium is 
mildly radioactive but will be produced and used within 
the reactor. Consequently, no transport of radioactive fuels 
will be needed for a fusion power plant — and even the 
worst possible accidents would not require the evacuation 
of neighbouring populations.

a low environmental impact (83). The neutrons gener-
ated by fusion will interact with the materials close to 
the reactor, but careful choice of these materials should 
ensure that no long-term legacy of radioactive waste 
is produced by fusion power.

International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor

ITER is an international nuclear fusion research and 
engineering project, which is currently building the 
world’s  largest  and  most  advanced  experimental 
tokamak nuclear fusion reactor at the Cadarache facility 
in the south of France. The ITER fusion reactor itself has 
been designed to produce 500 MW of output power 
for 50 MW of input power — 10 times the amount of 
energy put in. The machine is expected to demonstrate 
the principle of producing more energy from the fusion 
process than is used to initiate it, something that has 
not yet been achieved with previous fusion reactors. 
Nuclear fusion has many potential attractions. Firstly, its 
hydrogen isotope fuels are relatively abundant — one 
of the necessary isotopes, deuterium, can be extracted 
from seawater, while the other fuel, tritium, could pos-
sibly be created using neutrons produced in the fusion 
reaction itself. Furthermore, a fusion reactor would pro-
duce virtually no carbon dioxide or other atmospheric 
pollutants, and its other waste products would be very 
short-lived compared to those produced by conven-
tional nuclear reactors.

The ITER reactor is a large-scale scientific experiment 
that aims to demonstrate that it is possible to produce 
commercial energy from fusion. The ITER reactor itself 
is designed to produce approximately 500 MW of fusion 
power sustained for up to 1 000 seconds (compared to 
JET’s peak of 16 MW for less than a second) by the fu-
sion of about 0.5 g of deuterium/tritium mixture in its 
approximately 840 m3 reactor chamber. Although the 
reactor is expected to produce 10 times more en ergy 
(in the form of heat) than the amount consumed to 
heat the plasma to fusion temperatures, the generated 
heat will not be used to generate any electricity. During 
its operational lifetime, the reactor will test key technol-
ogies necessary for the next step: the demonstration 

(83)  Fusion power will not create greenhouse gases, produce 
other harmful pollutants or result in long-lasting radioactive 
waste. Its fuel consumption will be extremely low. A 1 000 
MW electric fusion power station would consume 100 kg 
of deuterium and 3 tonnes of lithium a year to generate 
7 billion kWh of power. To do the same, a coal-ﬁred power 
station would need 1.5 million tonnes of coal.

capture fusion energy for commercial use.

1.4.2  Research in nuclear fission

Global energy demand is on the rise and the European 
Union (EU) is increasingly relying on imports to meet its 
energy needs (84). The 151 nuclear reactors operating 
within the EU (85) provide over 30 % of our electricity 
needs and avoid the emission of 700 million tonnes of 
carbon dioxide per year. Having been in use for over 
50 years, nuclear energy already forms part of the en-
ergy mix in those EU Member States that have decided 
to use it.

Fission research

For about two decades, civil nuclear power stations in 
a number of European countries have been responsible 
for producing approximately one third of all the EU’s 
electricity. Nuclear science and technology has other 
applications apart from energy production. For exam-
ple, radiation is used extensively in medical diagnostic 
and therapeutic practices, such as imaging (e.g. X-rays), 
cancer radiotherapy or radioactive tracers. All uses of 
radioactive materials require appropriate safety meas-
ures to protect workers and the public (86).

Current Euratom research efforts focus on the safe, 
long-term  management  of  hazardous  radioactive 

(84)  In 2007, dependence on imported energy in the EU amount-
ed to 53 %; if the current trend continues, by 2030, energy 
dependence will have grown to 67 %. By the same year, 
carbon dioxide emissions are forecast to exceed the 1990 
limits set by the Kyoto Protocol by 5.4 %.

(85)  At the EU level, a wide range of nuclear-related activities 
such as health protection, safeguarding against prolifera-
tion of nuclear weapons, supply of nuclear fuel and nuclear 
research fall under the scope of the Treaty Establishing the 
European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), one of 
the original Treaties of Rome in 1957 and signed by all EU 
Member States. Nuclear research is funded by the European 
Commission through multiannual Euratom framework pro-
grammes, run in parallel with the much larger framework 
programmes under the EC Treaty.

(86)  Key thematic areas of interest include safe long-term man-
agement of radioactive waste (including disposal as well 
as technologies to reduce and recycle hazardous material), 
nuclear installation safety, the design of more eﬃcient and 
sustainable nuclear reactors, and the risks of low and pro-
tracted exposure to ionising radiation. Key cross-cutting 
areas include research infrastructures and education and 
training. Most funding is shared cost, with partners in sup-
ported projects providing matching ﬁnancing.

waste, investigating advanced concepts for nuclear 
reactor technology, optimising the use of uranium 
resources, and ensuring that all uses of nuclear tech-
nology meet high safety and performance standards. 
The Directorate-General for Research and Innovation’s 
budget for nuclear fission and radiation protection re-
search is EUR 287 million for 2007–11.

1.4.3  Research in non-nuclear energy 

production

Photovoltaic

Converting the sun’s radiation directly into electric-
ity is achieved by solar cells. These cells are made of 
semiconducting materials similar to those used in com-
puter chips. Solar cells are used in consumer products 
(such as calculators or watches), mounted on roofs of 
houses or assembled into large power stations. Today, 
the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid-
connected power generation, but a smaller market for 
off-grid power is growing for remote areas and devel-
oping countries.

Fuel Cell and Hydrogen (FCH) energy technologies

Fuel cells, as a conversion technology, and hydrogen, 
as a clean energy carrier, have great potential to con-
tribute to addressing the energy challenges facing 
Europe. The use of hydrogen as an energy carrier re-
quires developing the entire supply chain, from car-
bon-lean hydrogen production to efficient conversion 
of the hydrogen with fuel cells to power end-use appli-
cations. Hydrogen can be produced in many different 
ways, using a wide range of technologies. Currently, 
hydrogen is a widely used industrial gas. However, its 
use in energy applications is still in its early stages. To-
day, hydrogen production is mostly on a large scale. 
Hydrogen can be burned either to provide heat, or to 
drive turbines, or in internal combustion engines for 
motive and electrical power (87). Whilst the production 

(87)  A number of hydrogen-fuelled passenger cars and buses 
are already in circulation, but increasing their number to 
a commercial scale requires lowering the price through 
technological development and mass-market production 
processes. Commercialisation also depends largely on the 
development of infrastructure for the production, storage, 
and distribution of hydrogen and special refuelling stations. 
Currently, only a small number of hydrogen refuelling sta-
tions exist worldwide, and refuelling station costs need to 
be reduced to make them commercially viable.

31

1 | SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS

of hydrogen requires energy, it is a transportable fuel 
if the fire risk can be minimised.

Fuel cells offer a significant advantage over traditional 
combustion-based thermal energy conversion in that 
they provide efficiencies of electrical power supply in 
the range of 35 % to 55 %, whilst causing very low levels 
of pollutant emission. They offer advantages of weight 
compared with batteries, and instantaneous refuelling, 
similar to combustion engines (88).

Concentrated solar power

Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is a technology which 
produces electricity by concentrating solar energy on 
a single focal point. This concentrated energy is then 
used to heat up a fluid, produce steam and activate 
turbines that produce electricity. The focusing of solar 
power can be achieved through a variety of techniques 
such as parabolic troughs, parabolic dishes or power 
tower systems. CSP can also provide combined heat 
and power, particularly in desalinisation plants. The 
exploitation of solar energy differs substantially de-
pending on sunlight conditions. Increasing the deploy-
ment of CSP technologies will require the removal of 
technical barriers. Improvements are needed in order 
to increase the grid flexibility and enhance the storage 
technologies. Moreover, the fact that sunshine is inter-
mittent poses a challenge in terms of efficient storage 
of surplus of energy. Thermal storage and hybrid opera-
tion (using biomass or fossil fuel as an alternative heat 
source) need to be further explored and improved. In 
the same way, further research into new applications, 
including water desalination and hydrogen production, 
needs to be continued and strengthened. Additional 
aspects to be addressed are land use, and landscape 
transformation, materials consumption and conversion 
efficiency.

Wind energy

Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing energy 
sources. Since 2000, around one third of all installed 
electricity generating capacity in the EU has been 

(88)  Electrochemical energy conversion involves complex devel-
opments of materials: due to the close link between electric-
ity ﬂow and corrosion processes, morphological changes, 
building of resistive layers and exhaustion of catalytically 
active components, material development for enhanced 
lifetimes becomes the major challenge in fuel cell basic re-
search and development.

wind power (89). Onshore, wind energy is a near-mature 
technology. The main technological development in 
recent years has been a trend towards ever-larger wind 
turbines. Since the first commercial wind turbines of 
the 1980s, their size has evolved from 0.022 MW to 
about 6 MW today. By 2030, average turbine sizes of 
2 MW (onshore) and 10 MW (offshore) are expected, 
with gigawatt-size wind farms likely for offshore. For 
the time being, wind energy from offshore contributes 
only a very small share to Europe’s total wind energy 
generation. This is expected to change in the coming 
decades since wind conditions are more preferable 
offshore and many well-placed onshore sites will be 
already in use. However, there are still important prob-
lems to be solved before offshore wind can be mas-
sively deployed (90). The actual contribution of wind en-
ergy to total electricity generation in 2007 was roughly 
119 TWh (including 4 TWh offshore) which corresponds 
to around 3.7 % of total EU electricity demand (as wind 
is an intermittent energy source, only part of its capa-
city can actually be used). More than two thirds of 
total EU wind capacity is currently installed in the three 
pioneering countries — Denmark, Germany and Spain. 
Denmark satisfies more than 20 % and Spain more than 
10 % of its electricity demand by wind energy.

Increasing wind deployment needs to be accompanied 
by increased grid flexibility and developments in stor-
age technologies. Increasing shares of wind energy 
will require a new grid philosophy and flexible, robust 
transmission and distribution grid infrastructures. 
Given that wind is an unpredictable and fluctuating en-
ergy source, the further development of energy storage 
mechanisms is another key prerequisite for large-scale 
wind deployment. In addition, wind technology needs 

(89)  The share of wind power in total electricity production in 
Europe was 3.7 % in 2007, but with huge diﬀerences among 
the Member States: Germany and Spain together account 
for more than half of the total installed capacity in Europe. 
In Denmark, wind energy contributes more than 20 % of the 
total electricity production of the country. The wind power 
industry has the ambition to continue the fast growth of 
recent years. The sector’s objective is to provide 20 % of 
ﬁnal EU electricity consumption by 2020.

(90)  The most challenging areas are turbine design, load man-
agement, the grid integration and better storage capacities. 
Wind power capacity witnessed a tremendous growth in 
recent years and reached a capacity of 56 GW (of which 
1.08 GW are oﬀshore) in 2007 which corresponds to 7.3 % of 
total capacity in the EU (data from the European Wind En-
ergy Association (EWEA)). More than 40 % of new electricity-
generating capacity added in 2007 was wind energy!

relevant climatic conditions.

Geothermal energy

Bioenergy and biofuels

Bioenergy is the conversion of biomass resources such 
as agricultural and forest residues, organic municipal 
waste and energy crops into useful energy carriers in-
cluding heat, electricity and transport fuels. For thou-
sands of years, firewood was the traditional source of 
heat for domestic purposes — local heating and food 
preparation — and this is still the case in many parts 
of the world. Today, the availability of biomass-derived 
solid fuels in clean and convenient forms (e.g. chips, 
pellets and briquettes) and modern combustion equip-
ment have created renewed interest in the use of solid 
biofuels for domestic heating. For the commercial and 
industrial sectors, currently available equipment al-
lows the efficient production of heat from biofuels on 
a larger scale.

Biofuels have been discussed because, in some cases, 
the balance of energy production (the energy obtained 
compared to the input of energy needed for the pro-
duction) is negative in some cases and because the 
use of plants that are also used for food may introduce 
a competing use that has an effect on food prices. First-
generation biofuels make use of starch and lipids to 
produce ethanol and biodiesel. Second-generation 
biofuels will make use of lignocellulose, which is more 
abundant and can be obtained from different types of 
crops. A third generation of biofuels may be obtained 
from microalgae.

Biomass, in addition to being convertible into energy 
carriers, can also be converted into biomaterials and 
biochemicals. The simultaneous production of bio-
energy, biomaterials and biochemicals takes place 
in  bio-refineries.  In  a  bio-refinery,  analogous  to 
a petroleum refinery, biomass feedstocks are converted 
into energy, fuels or other products using a range of 
thermochemical and biochemical processes. Some of 
these techniques are already at a stage of commercial 
development while others require further research and 
technological development (91).

For close to 100 years, geothermal energy has also 
been used for electricity generation. Today, so-called 
Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS, also known as Hot 
Dry Rock) enable the exploitation of the earth’s heat 
to produce electricity without having natural water 
resources. To extract energy from hot impermeable 
rock, water is injected from the surface into boreholes 
in order to widen them and create fractures in the hot 
rock. Flowing through these holes, the water heats up 
and, when it returns to the surface, is used to generate 
electricity. Clean, renewable, constant and available 
worldwide, geothermal energy is already being used 
in a large number of thermal and electric power plants.

Ocean energy

Oceans are an enormous source of energy. It is esti-
mated that 0.1 % of the energy in ocean waves could 
be capable of supplying the entire world’s energy 
requirements five times over. Currently, a number of 
technologies aimed at harnessing this potential have 
been investigated and are at various stages of develop-
ment including tidal and marine energy, wave energy, 
differences in temperature and salinity energy. Con-
version of tidal energy into electricity has been widely 
investigated and can be compared to the technology 
used in hydroelectric power plants. Electricity could 
be generated by water flowing in to and out of gates 
and turbines installed along a dam or barrage built 
across a tidal bay or estuary. Technologies for exploit-
ing wave and currents energy have been, or are being, 
developed and tested on a small scale and, for a limited 
number of cases, on a large scale. Technologies related 
to differences in temperature or salinity are at an early 
stage of development. With Ocean Thermal Energy 
Conversion (OTEC), the difference in temperature be-
tween cold, deep-sea waters and warm, shallow waters 
creates a thermodynamic cycle, which can be used to 
produce electricity. In the case of salinity gradients, the 
difference in salinity between seawater and fresh water 
creates a pressure difference that can be exploited to 
extract energy. Today, ocean energy provides around 
0.02 % of the EU’s energy needs and is primarily used 
for electricity production.

(91)  The total annual demand for biomass has increased steadily 
over recent years and currently accounts for over 10 % of 
global primary energy consumption. Approximately two 
thirds of this biomass is consumed in developing countries 
as traditional, non-commercial biomass for domestic cook-
ing and heating.

Hydropower is an extremely flexible technology for 
power generation. Hydro reservoirs provide built-in en-
ergy storage, and the fast response time of hydropower 
enables it to be used to optimise electricity production 

Hydropower

33

1 | SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS

across grids, meeting sudden fluctuations in demands. 
Despite being a mature technology in comparison with 
other renewable energy sources, hydropower still has 
a significant potential (92).

In 2006, hydropower accounted for approximately 
80 % of electricity generated from renewable sources 
in Europe, and 10 % of total electricity consumption in 
Europe. Electricity generation from small hydropower 
systems made up about 3 % of the total electricity 
generation in Europe. Like other energy technologies, 
hydropower technologies need to improve efficiencies, 
reduce costs and environmental impacts and improve 
dependability. In general, large hydroelectric plants 
have little difficulty in competing with conventional 
generation, but small hydro, especially the very small 
and the low-head plants, can normally only compete 
where allowances are made for the external costs as-
sociated with fossil fuels and nuclear power.

Clean coal technologies and carbon 
capture and storage

Technological progress in recent years has created a re-
markable new opportunity for coal. A new generation 
of coal-fired power plants is emerging with higher ef-
ficiencies and, thus, lower emissions. In parallel, a suite 
of technologies is being developed for the safe capture 
and storage of carbon dioxide (CCS) from fossil fuel 
conversion processes (93).

The main fossil fuel-based electricity generation tech-
nology in the EU is pulverised coal. A typical state-of-
the-art supercritical pulverised coal plant operates at 
45 % efficiency, while few, more advanced, coal power 
plants demonstrate efficiencies up to 48 %. Other tech-
nologies, such as Integrated Gasification in Combined 
Cycle (IGCC) and circulating fluidised bed combustion 

(92)  New plants can be developed and old ones upgraded, es-
pecially in terms of increasing eﬃciency and electricity pro-
duction as well as environmental performance. In particular, 
the development of low-head or very low-head small hydro 
plants holds much promise.

(93)  The challenge is to bring these technologies together into 
a new concept for future coal-based near-zero emission 
power production. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is 
a technology which would allow capturing and storing the 
carbon dioxide emitted by the large fossil fuel power plants, 
which are mostly ﬁred with coal, lignite or natural gas. CCS 
could play an important role in a transition phase towards 
a decarbonised economy, and as such oﬀers a unique op-
portunity in the medium term.

could be commercialised during the same period, with 
efficiencies reaching 45–55 %. Zero emission fossil fuel 
power plants (ZEP plants) make the assumption that 
they will capture at least 85 % of the carbon dioxide 
formed during the power generation process (94). The 
first generation of commercialised pulverised coal, 
combined cycle gas turbine and IGCC plants with car-
bon dioxide capture are expected to have efficiencies 
of 33 %, 48 % and 35 % respectively.

Currently, fossil fuel power plants are the backbone of 
the European electricity generation system, providing 
56 % of the total electricity demand, followed by nu-
clear energy (31 %) and renewables (13 %). In the EU, 
coal plants have a 29 % share in electricity generation 
and natural gas combined cycle plants, 19 %.

Smart grids

The upgrade and development of energy networks 
across the EU is one of the key challenges to securing 
a sustainable and competitive energy future in the EU. 
Today’s energy networks are primarily based on large 
central power stations with one-way power flow from 
the network to the passive consumer. In the future, 
energy networks need to become ‘smarter’. Smart en-
ergy networks will be more resilient and able to avoid 
blackouts. They will allow significant savings in energy 
with better interconnections, and enable an active role 
for consumers. In addition, smart energy networks will 
increase the use of renewable energy resources by 
better integrating them. The re-engineering process 
from current networks to smart energy networks en-
compasses a complex range of issues covering market 
design, organisational, regulatory and technical issues.

Materials and future and emerging technologies

Materials research is probably a necessary element 
in the development of the technologies needed to 
provide a clean, reliable supply of efficient energy. 
The aim is to push the limits of the future emerging 

(94)  The carbon dioxide that will be captured is to be trans-
ported to suitable underground locations where it will be 
stored permanently and safely. Currently, all elements of the 
technology of ZEP plants have been developed and uti-
lised by other industrial sectors; however, on much smaller 
scales than those needed for electricity generation. Capture 
technology (pre- and post-combustion and oxyfuel) is at an 
advanced stage. From the technology point of view, ZEP 
plants can be commercialised as of 2020, with ﬁrst-of-a-kind 
plants coming into operation by 2015.

In addition, electrical energy for transport needs to be stored in some form. The demand for energy varies as well, depending on external temperatures, and even on the timing of commercial breaks in television pro-grammes. Storage is useful in ‘load-levelling’, where electricity is stored during periods of low demand and released when there is high demand. During the pas-sage of the Storage Act (2011) in the United States, the chair of the Senate Committee stated:95An important report into storage issues was published in March 2012 by the Congressional Research Services in the United States: Energy Storage for Power Grids and Electric Transportation: A Technology Assessment (96).(95) Oﬃce of Senator Ron Wyden, ‘Wyden, Collins, Bingaman Legislation Will Increase Investments in the Storage of Re-newable Energy’, press release, 10 November 2011.(96) http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42455.pdfDeployment of storage technologies will make our nation’s electricity grid more reliable while also ena-bling more efficient use of existing energy sources as well as new ones, such as wind and solar ... These technologies have the potential to cut electricity bills, reduce peak power demand and lower greenhouse gas emissions (95).2.  Regulatory and policy frameworks for energy and environment

The topics of energy and environment have become so 
important that an extensive and diversified number of 
rules of different nature and comprehensiveness (hard 
or soft law, binding regulations, strategy plans, road-
maps, etc.) have been developed. At the same time, the 
development of ‘law’ addresses a range of areas of EU 
jurisdiction — environment, common market, move-
ment of capital, services and persons, competition, 
foreign policy, etc. It is neither possible, nor necessary, 
to address them all in detail. We, therefore, address the 
regulations deemed most relevant, having regard to 
the most recent energy policy options adopted in the 
EU as well as the fundamental legislation (the Lisbon 
Treaty).

2.1  The European Coal and Steel Community 
and the Treaty Establishing the European 
Atomic Energy Community

The establishment of the European Coal and Steel 
Community (ECSC), which came into being in July 
1952, was the first great achievement of the supra-
national Europe following the Second World War. For 
the first time, the six Member States of this organisa-
tion surrendered part of their national sovereignty, al-
beit in a limited field. While it might have been feared 
that the effort undertaken by the ECSC would not bear 
fruit, the Messina Conference of June 1955 attempted 
to relaunch the European process. The Conference was 
followed by a series of other meetings of ministers and 
experts. A preparatory committee was set up at the 
beginning of 1956 with the task of preparing a report 
on the creation of a European Common Market. In April 
1956, the committee proposed a set of two projects 
that corresponded to the two options chosen by the 
States:

1.  the creation of a generalised common market;

2.  the creation of an atomic energy community.

These ‘Treaties of Rome’ were signed in Rome in March 
1957. The first treaty established a European Economic 
Community (EEC) and the second established a Euro-
pean Atomic Energy Community, better known as 
Euratom. Following unproblematic ratification in the 
various countries, the two treaties entered into force 
on 1 January 1958.

The main objective of the Euratom Treaty was to tackle 
the general shortage of ‘conventional’ energy in the 

1950s: the six founding States (Belgium, Germany, 
France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) looked 
to nuclear energy as a means of achieving energy in-
dependence. Since the costs of investing in nuclear 
en ergy could not be met by individual States, the 
founding States joined together to form Euratom. The 
general objective of the Treaty is, therefore, to con-
tribute to the formation and development of Europe’s 
nuclear industries, so that all the Member States can 
benefit from the development of atomic energy, and to 
ensure security of supply. At the same time, the Treaty 
guarantees high safety standards for the public and 
prevents nuclear materials intended principally for ci-
vilian use from being diverted to military use. It is im-
portant to note that Euratom’s powers are limited to 
peaceful civil uses of nuclear energy.

Although the Euratom Treaty does not give the Com-
munity strict, exclusive powers in certain fields, it re-
tains real added value for its members: on the basis of 
this Treaty, the Commission has adopted recommenda-
tions and decisions which, although not binding, set 
European standards. In addition, other Community 
policies, for example the environment and research 
policies, have also had a marked impact on the nuclear 
industry.

Over the years, other nuclear energy issues have grown 
in importance (97), notably operational safety of nuclear 
facilities, storage of radioactive waste, and nuclear non-
proliferation (nuclear safeguards). Although the Mem-
ber States retain most powers in these fields, a degree 
of uniformity has been achieved at international level 
with the aid of a series of treaties, conventions and 
initiatives which, one by one, have pieced together an 

(97)  The value added by Euratom and the EU can be seen par-
ticularly clearly in the context of enlargement. As a result 
of Euratom, the EU pursues a harmonised Community ap-
proach to nuclear energy with which candidate countries 
must comply. The enlargements of the EU to the east put 
the spotlight on the nuclear sector, and particularly nuclear 
safety issues. Nuclear power is an important energy source 
for many eastern European countries (candidates or new 
members of the EU). However, the safety standards in their 
nuclear power plants and the level of protection of the pub-
lic and workers are not always suﬃcient. In this context, the 
Commission has provided them with support to improve 
the situation via the PHARE programme. Since the collapse 
of the Soviet Union, many of the newly independent States 
(NIS) are facing the same problems and they too receive aid 
from the Commission.

38An ethical framework for assessing research, production and use of energy2 | REGULATORY AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTinternational regulatory framework governing activi-ties in the nuclear sector (the Convention on Nuclear Safety). The Treaty amending the EU and EC Treaties, which was signed in December 2007, changed cer-tain provisions of the Euratom Treaty via its Protocol No 12 amending the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. These changes are limited to adaptations taking account of the new rules estab-lished by the amending Treaty, particularly in the in-stitutional and financial fields (98). In March 2007, the Commission reviewed and assessed the outlook for the Euratom Treaty (99).2.2 The Treaty of Lisbon and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European UnionThe Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 Decem-ber 2009 and amends the EU main treaties, the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty establish-ing the European Community (TEC), now called the Treaty of Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Among other things, for the first time, the Treaty defines the different categories of the EU’s compe-tences as being exclusive, shared and supporting (93). Articles 2 to 6 TFEU list the respective areas for each type. In relation to the policies where the Commu-nity already had competences, the Treaty only pro-vides codification. For example, it codifies the EU environmental competence, which remains a shared responsibility (100).2.2.1 Energy policy and the TreatyThe Treaty introduces a chapter on energy (Chapter XXI, Article 194) in the TFEU setting up the policy framework of the EU energy policy establishing four objectives guiding its development. This new Article 194 reveals the importance of energy as one of the main priorities of the EU stating that:(98) Unlike the EC Treaty, no major changes have ever been made to the Euratom Treaty, which remains in force. The European Atomic Energy Community has not merged with the European Union and, therefore, retains a separate legal personality, while sharing the same institutions.(99) http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_ aﬀairs/treaties/treaties_euratom_en.htm(100) http://www.clientearth.org/reports/clientearth-brieﬁng-lisbon-treaty-impact-on-climate-and-energy-policy.pdfSolidaritySolidarity is the base for the implementation of the estab-lished policies. This spirit of solidarity is found in the meas-ures that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission may take when ‘appropriate to the economic situation, in particular if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products, notably in the area of energy’, as established in Article 122(1) TFEU (101). And, although the ‘solidarity clause’ among the Union and the Member States is also present in Article 222 TFEU in the event of natural or man-made disasters, it is not, however, defined for energy po-licies purposes what the spirit of solidarity will imply.Shared competence and autonomy of the Member StatesEnergy is a sphere of shared competence with the Member States and the Commission. In fact, the au-tonomy of Member States in certain matters of deci-sions on energy issues is now underlined in the specific provision on energy of Article 194(2) (102). Decisions on (101) Article 122(1) TFEU states: Without prejudice to any other procedures provided for in the Treaties, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may decide, in a spirit of solidarity between Member States, upon the measures ap-propriate to the economic situation, in particular if severe diﬃculties arise in the supply of certain products, notably in the area of energy.(102) Article 194(2): Without prejudice to the application of other provisions of the Treaties, the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall establish the measures necessary to achieve the objectives in paragraph 1. Such measures shall be adopt-ed after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. Such measures shall not aﬀect a Member State’s right to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between diﬀerent energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply, without prejudice to Article 192(2)(c) (http://www.lisbon-trea-ty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-xxi-energy/485-article-194.html).In the context of the establishment and functioning of the internal market and with regard for the need to pre-serve and improve the environment, Union policy on en-ergy shall aim, in a spirit of solidarity between Member States, to: (a) ensure the functioning of the energy mar-ket; (b) ensure security of energy supply in the Union; (c) promote energy efficiency and energy saving and the development of new and renewable forms of energy; and (d) promote the interconnection of energy networks.REGULATORY AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT | 2

energy should be taken within the normal procedures 
of the legislative procedure in order to ‘establish the 
measures necessary to achieve the objectives in para-
graph 1’ (ensure the functioning of the energy market; 
ensure security of energy supply in the Union; promote 
energy efficiency and energy saving and the develop-
ment of new and renewable forms of energy; and pro-
mote the interconnection of energy networks). Mem-
ber States are competent to determine their national 
energy policies in regard to the right to determine the 
conditions for exploiting the national energy resources, 
their choice between different energy sources and the 
general structure of their energy supply (103). EU meas-
ures based on the energy provisions of the TFEU will 
not be possible if they affect a Member State’s right 
to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy 
resources. However, the EU measure could be based 
on Article 192(1) of the environmental policy title and, 
therefore, could be adopted by ordinary legislative pro-
cedure (ex codecision) even if it affects Member States’ 
rights to determine the conditions for exploiting their 
own energy resources.

Member States’ competence could, in some circum-
stances, also be limited by unanimous decisions of the 
Council after consultation with the European Parlia-
ment and the Economic and Social Committee of the 
Regions on measures significantly affecting a Mem -
ber State’s choice between different energy sources 

(103)  The above rules may change when energy policy options 
refer to environmental provision (under environmental legal 
bases, most measures dealing with energy issues from an 
environmental/climate change perspective can be adopted, 
either by codecision under Article 192(1) TFEU or by spe-
cial legislative procedure (unanimity of the Council) under 
Article 192(2) TFEU). Therefore, measures at EU level aﬀect-
ing Member States’ choice between energy sources or the 
structure of the energy supply could not be adopted if its 
legal basis is the energy provision of the TFEU but could 
be adopted by the ordinary legislative procedure (ex co-
decision) under Article 192(1) of the environmental policy 
provisions. The same applies to EU measures signiﬁcantly 
aﬀecting Member States’ choice between energy sources or 
the structure of their energy supply which could be adopt-
ed (by unanimity) at EU level if based on the Article 192(2) 
TFEU under the environment title (http://www.clientearth.
org/reports/clientearth-brieﬁng-lisbon-treaty-impact-on-
climate-and-energy-policy.pdf).

and the general structure of its energy supply (Article 
192(2)(c) TFEU) (104).

This new legal basis introduced in the Treaty allowing 
the EU to establish measures related to energy policy 
and the responsibility of the Member States for nation-
al energy sources is a balance to be achieved revealing 
the complex environment of the application of energy 
policies. Moreover, those decisions remain a responsi-
bility of the Member States, which means that decisions 
may vary from country to country, sometimes affecting 
many other countries apart from the one where those 
national decisions have been taken.

(104)  Article 192 TFEU states:  

1. The European Parliament and the Council, acting in accord-
ance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consult-
ing the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee 
of the Regions, shall decide what action is to be taken by 
the Union in order to achieve the objectives referred to in 
Article 191. 
2. By way of derogation from the decision-making proce-
dure provided for in paragraph 1 and without prejudice to 
Article 114, the Council acting unanimously in accordance 
with a special legislative procedure and after consulting the 
European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee 
and the Committee of the Regions, shall adopt: (a) provisions 
primarily of a ﬁscal nature; (b) measures aﬀecting: — town 
and country planning, — quantitative management of water 
resources or aﬀecting, directly or indirectly, the availability 
of those resources, — land use, with the exception of waste 
management; (c) measures signiﬁcantly aﬀecting a Member 
State’s choice between different energy sources and the 
general structure of its energy supply. The Council, acting 
unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after 
consulting the European Parliament, the Economic and Social 
Committee and the Committee of the Regions, may make 
the ordinary legislative procedure applicable to the matters 
referred to in the ﬁrst subparagraph.
3. General action programmes setting out priority objec-
tives to be attained shall be adopted by the European 
Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the 
ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Eco-
nomic and Social Committee and the Committee of the 
Regions. The measures necessary for the implementation 
of these programmes shall be adopted under the terms of 
paragraph 1 or 2, as the case may be.
4. Without prejudice to certain measures adopted by the 
Union, the Member States shall ﬁnance and implement the 
environment policy.
5. Without prejudice to the principle that the polluter should 
pay, if a measure based on the provisions of paragraph 1 
involves costs deemed disproportionate for the public au-
thorities of a Member State, such measure shall lay down 
appropriate provisions in the form of: — temporary deroga-
tions, and/or — ﬁnancial support from the Cohesion Fund 
set up pursuant to Article 177.

2 | REGULATORY AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT

The Member States have the right to conduct their bi-
lateral energy relations with non-EU countries but they 
are also subject to general obligations of cooperation 
and competition within the EU. This is also important 
in view of the trans-European networks in the areas 
of energy structures and the special consideration 
due to the aim of promoting the interconnection and 
interoperability of national networks as well as the ac-
cess to such networks and, in particular, of the need 
to link island, landlocked and peripheral regions with 
the central regions of the Union, as stated in Article 170 
TFEU (105).

In the same line regarding the competences of each 
Member State, it is underlined that the principle of neu-
trality in the system of property ownership in the Mem-
ber States (106) established in Article 345 TFEU, which, in 
the context of energy, assumes a particular importance.

Although the Treaty has not previously established 
an EU competence on energy, the EU has been devel-
oping energy policies through its competences with 
regard to the environment, competition and internal 
market policies which have contributed in shaping the 
energy sector. With the establishment of the legal ba-
sis in Article 194, the connection with those policies 
and legislations continues to be essential. Those provi-
sions contribute to understanding the complexity of 
the legal structure and the need of interpretation in 
view of the competences established and the policies 
to implement (107).

(105)  Article 170 TFEU states: 

1. To help achieve the objectives referred to in Articles 26 and 
174 and to enable citizens of the Union, economic operators 
and regional and local communities to derive full beneﬁt from 
the setting-up of an area without internal frontiers, the Union 
shall contribute to the establishment and development of 
trans-European networks in the areas of transport, telecom-
munications and energy infrastructures. 
2. Within the framework of a system of open and competitive 
markets, action by the Union shall aim at promoting the inter-
connection and interoperability of national networks as well 
as access to such networks. It shall take account in particular 
of the need to link island, landlocked and peripheral regions 
with the central regions of the Union.

(106)  Article 345 TFEU: The Treaties shall in no way prejudice the 
rules in Member States governing the system of property 
ownership.

(107)  The question of how to determine the legal basis for speciﬁc 
legislation is based on the European Court of Justice juris-
prudence which states that the choice of legal basis must 
be informed by the stated objectives and the content of the 
measure. Where a measure has more than one objective and 
they are of similar importance, it must be based on the vari-
ous provisions unless there is a clear incompatibility in the 
decision-making procedures (e.g. Case C-300/89, Commission 
v Council (1991) ECR I-287, para.10; Case C-300/89 Commission 
v Council (1991) ECR I-2867, paras 17–21; and Case C-388/01 
Commission v Council (2004) ECR I-4829, para. 58).

2 | REGULATORY AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT

2.2.2  Energy and environmental 
policy in the Treaty

Article 191 TFEU ( 108) refers to the objectives of the 
EU environmental policy, the principles to be taken 
into account in the definition and application of such 
policies, implementing what is stated on the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Article 37 
on environmental protection) (109).

Those principles, together with the requirement in 
Article 194(1) (Energy Chapter), regarding the ‘need to 
preserve and improve the environment’ and those of 
Article 11 TFEU (110), can lead to the conclusion that the 

(108)  Article 191 TFEU states: 

1. Union policy on the environment shall contribute to pursuit 
of the following objectives: — preserving, protecting and 
improving the quality of the environment,— protecting 
human health, — prudent and rational utilisation of natural 
resources, — promoting measures at international level to 
deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, 
and in particular combating climate change.
 2. Union policy on the environment shall aim at a high level 
of protection taking into account the diversity of situations 
in the various regions of the Union. It shall be based on the 
precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive 
action should be taken, that environmental damage should 
as a priority be rectiﬁed at source and that the polluter should 
pay. In this context, harmonisation measures answering en-
vironmental protection requirements shall include, where 
appropriate, a safeguard clause allowing Member States to 
take provisional measures, for non-economic environmental 
reasons, subject to a procedure of inspection by the Union.
3. In preparing its policy on the environment, the Union shall 
take account of: — available scientiﬁc and technical data, — 
environmental conditions in the various regions of the Union, 
— the potential beneﬁts and costs of action or lack of action, 
— the economic and social development of the Union as 
a whole and the balanced development of its regions. 
4. Within their respective spheres of competence, the Union 
and the Member States shall cooperate with third countries 
and with the competent international organisations. The ar-
rangements for Union cooperation may be the subject of 
agreements between the Union and the third parties con-
cerned. The previous subparagraph shall be without preju-
dice to Member States’ competence to negotiate in interna-
tional bodies and to conclude international agreements.

principles mentioned in the chapter on the environ-
ment should be taken in consideration in the energy 
legislation. In fact, the integration principle, stated in 
Article 11 applied to the environment protection has, 
as its consequence, the integration of environmental 
protection requirements into the definition and imple-
mentation of Union policies and activities, in particular 
with a view to promoting sustainable development. 
Consequently, principles applicable primarily to the 
environment, such as the sustainable development 
principle or the precautionary principle, may be envis-
aged as also being applicable to energy policies.

Member Sates’ autonomy is one of the most relevant 
characteristics of energy policies. Shared competence 
may be one of the most challenging tasks in EU policies 
in the present and coming years. The fragmentation of 
law is also verified not only at different levels but for 
different sectors: energy, environment, climate, compe-
tition, etc., and has, for sure, transnational dimensions. 
A decision taken in one country or in several countries 
may have consequences in a global dimension.

2.3  EU energy policy

In order to develop and monitor the legal framework 
established in the Treaty, the EU has developed an en-
ergy policy and plans including strategies, action plans, 
roadmaps, papers and reports whose policies must be 
implemented through legal documents either binding 
or indicative, such as directives or national plans, re-
porting obligations, etc. Key objectives and milestones 
are provided in the following main policy documents:

 European Research Area framework

(109)  Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the 
European Union states: A high level of environmental pro-
tection and the improvement of the quality of the envi-
ronment must be integrated into the policies of the Union 
and ensured in accordance with the principle of sustainable 
development.

(110)  Article 11 TFEU: Environmental protection requirements 
must be integrated into the deﬁnition and implementation 
of the Union policies and activities, in particular with a view 
to promoting sustainable development.

The Treaty states that research policy is a shared com-
petence between Member States and the Union. Art-
icle 179 TFEU lays down the right of the Union to cre-
ate the necessary conditions for realising the European 
Research Area. Article 182(5) TFEU provides for the use 
of the legislative procedure to establish the necessary 
measures for the implementation of the European 
Research Area (ERA). The completion of the ERA does 
not call into question the sovereignty of the Member

States. In the ERA, national research systems do not dis-
appear but work together in an open way. The policy 
options selected respect the subsidiarity principle to 
the extent that the Union is best placed to identify ar-
eas of action for Member States, given the persistent 
barriers and the limited progress observed 12 years 
after the launch of the ERA at the Lisbon European 
Council in 2000.

The ERA is a unified research area open to the world 
based on the internal market, in which researchers, 
scientific knowledge and technology circulate freely 
and through which the Union and its Member States 
shall strengthen their scientific and technological bases 
as well as their competitiveness and their capacity to 
collectively address grand challenges.

Launched in March 2000, the ERA has become one of 
the key objectives of the Union since the entry into 
force of the Lisbon Treaty. An ERA framework and sup-
porting measures were announced in the 2010 Innova-
tion Union (IU) flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 
strategy. On two occasions (February 2011 and March 
2012), the European Council has called for the ERA to 
be completed by 2014.

The overarching policy goal of the ERA is to increase 
the performance, excellence and impact of Europe’s 
R & D system. This will help the EU get back on to the 
path of economic growth by fostering scientific ex-
cellence and research, underpinning innovation and 
increasing the attractiveness of the EU as a research 
location. Notably, it will help speed up the quest for 
solutions to societal challenges such as ageing of the 
population and energy security. The combination of 
the ERA and Horizon 2020 (the Commission’s proposal 
for research and innovation) is expected to generate 
an extra 1.17 % of growth and almost 1.1 million more 
jobs annually by 2030. The five key priorities are: in-
creasing the effectiveness of national research systems; 
improving transnational competition and cooperation, 
including on key research infrastructures; a more open 
labour market for researchers; gender equality and 
mainstreaming in organisations carrying out and se-
lecting research projects; and optimal circulation and 
transfer of scientific information. The Horizon 2020 
programme, currently being discussed in the European 
Parliament and by the Council, will be the financial pil-
lar of the Union’s actions to create the IU. The actions 
in the ERA communication will be the non-financial pil-
lar. Both are closely interlinked: funding measures are 
crucial to the realisation of ERA, notably through their 
effect on coordination, common agenda setting and 

pooling of resources, and to continue shaping the land-
scape of European research institutions. Horizon 2020 
will support the ERA policy priorities. As far as energy 
policy and research is concerned, the ERA concept is 
put into practice by the Strategic Energy Technology 
Plan (SET-Plan).

2.3.2  SET-Plan

The SET-Plan (the European Strategic Energy Technol-
ogy Plan) defines a new EU approach to accelerate the 
development of cost-effective low-carbon technolo-
gies that are crucial to achieve the transformation of 
the entire EU energy system (20-20-20 goals). The SET-
Plan establishes a number of innovative mechanisms 
ensuring its effective implementation. Member States’ 
governments are engaged in the steering group that 
defines the overall strategy. At a sectoral level, six 
European industrial indicatives bring together indus-
try active in each of these areas to define ambitious 
objectives and work together towards achieving them. 
Research centres pool part of their resources in the Eu-
ropean Energy Research Alliance and try to establish 
common research agendas. The SET-Plan includes: the 
European Industrial Bio energy Initiative (EIBI); the Euro-
pean CO2 Capture, Transport and Storage Initiative; the 
European Electricity Grid Initiative (EEGI); the Duel Cells 
and Hydrogen Joint Technology Initiative; the Sustain-
able Nuclear Initiative; Energy Efficiency — the Smart 
Cities Initiative; the Solar Europe Initiative; the SET-Plan 
Steering Group; the European Energy Research Alli-
ance; and the SET-Plan Information System.

The SET-Plan faces up to the challenges of this sector:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

in the short term, by increasing research to reduce 
costs and improve performance of existing tech-
nologies, and by encouraging the commercial im-
plementation of these technologies (111);

in the longer term, by supporting development of 
a new generation of low-carbon technologies (112).

(111)  Activities at this level should, in particular, involve second-
generation biofuels, capture, transport and storage of 
carbon, integration of renewable energy sources into the 
electricity network and energy eﬃciency in construction, 
transport and industry.

(112)  The activities to be carried out should focus, among other 
things, on the competitiveness of new technologies relating 
to renewable energies, energy storage, and sustainability 
of ﬁssion energy, fusion energy, and the development of 
trans-European energy networks.

43

2 | REGULATORY AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT

Implementation of the SET-Plan will involve collective 
efforts and activities in the private sector, the Member 
States and the EU, as well as internationally. The SET-Plan, 
first of all, proposes a new governance method for en-
ergy technologies, based on joint strategic planning.

The SET-Plan also improves the effectiveness of the 
implementation of the jointly decided actions, so as 
to take full advantage of the possibilities offered by 
the ERA and the internal market. The Commission will, 
therefore, gradually launch new European industrial 
initiatives, in wind energy, solar energy, bio-energy, 
capture, transport and storage of CO2, the electricity 
network and nuclear fission, which will take the form 
of public–private partnerships or joint programmes 
between Member States. An increase in resources, 
both financial and human, is another major element of 
the SET-Plan. Finally, the SET-Plan makes provision for 
intensified international cooperation, in order to pro-
mote the development, marketing, deployment and 
accessibility of low-carbon technologies worldwide.

2.3.3  Energy 20-20-20 strategy

In January 2008, the European Commission proposed 
binding legislation to implement the 20-20-20 targets. 
This ‘climate and energy package’ (a 20 % reduction 
in EU greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels; an 
increase in the proportion of EU energy produced from 
renewable resources to 20 %; a 20 % improvement in 
the EU’s energy efficiency) was agreed by the European 
Parliament and the Council in December 2008 and be-
came law in June 2009.

The core of the package comprises four pieces of com-
plementary legislation.

(cid:116)(cid:1) A revision and strengthening of the Emissions 
Trading System (ETS), the EU’s key tool for cutting 
emissions cost-effectively. A single EU-wide cap on 
emission allowances will apply from 2013 and will 
be cut annually, reducing the number of allowances 
available to businesses to 21 % below the 2005 level 
in 2020. The free allocation of allowances will be 
gradually replaced by auctioning, and the coverage 
sectors and gases covered by the system will be 
somewhat expanded.

(cid:116)(cid:1) An ‘effort-sharing decision’ governing emissions 
from sectors not covered by the EU ETS, such as 
transport, housing, agriculture and waste: the tar-
gets range from an emissions reduction of 20 % 
by the richest Member States to an increase in 

emissions of 20 % by the poorest. These national 
targets will cut the EU’s overall emissions from the 
non-ETS sectors by 10 % by 2020 compared with 
2005 levels.

(cid:116)(cid:1) Binding  national  targets  for  renewable  energy 
which, collectively, will lift the average renewable 
share across the EU to 20 % by 2020 (more than dou-
ble the 2006 level of 9.2 %). The targets will contrib-
ute to decreasing the EU’s dependence on imported 
energy and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

(cid:116)(cid:1) A legal framework to promote the development and 
safe use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) (113).

The climate and energy package creates pressure to im-
prove energy efficiency but does not address it directly: 
that is being done through the EU’s energy efficiency 
action plan.

2.3.4  Energy Roadmap 2050

The aim of the Energy Roadmap 2050 is to achieve the 
low-carbon 2050 objectives while improving Europe’s 
competitiveness and security of supply (114). The Road-
map will be followed by further policy initiatives on 
specific energy policy areas in the coming years, start-
ing with proposals on the internal market, renewable 
energy and nuclear safety next year.

To achieve the goal of cutting emissions by over 80 % 
by 2050, Europe’s energy production will have to be 
almost carbon-free. How to achieve this without dis-
rupting energy supplies and competitiveness is the 

(113)  CCS is a promising family of technologies that capture the 
carbon dioxide emitted by industrial processes and store 
it in underground geological formations where it cannot 
contribute to global warming. Although the diﬀerent com-
ponents of CCS are already deployed at commercial scale, 
the technical and economic viability of its use as an inte-
grated system has yet to be shown. The EU, therefore, plans 
to set up a network of CCS demonstration plants by 2015 
to test its viability, with the aim of commercial update of 
CCS by around 2020. Revised EU Guidelines on State aid for 
environmental protection, issued at the same time as the 
legislative package was proposed, enable governments to 
provide ﬁnancial support for CCS pilot plants.

(114)  In March 2011, the EC published the overall decarbonisation 
roadmap covering the whole economy. All sectors — power 
generation, transport, residential, industry and agriculture 
— were analysed. The Commission has also been preparing 
sectoral roadmaps, inter alia, the Energy Roadmap 2050, the 
last, and focusing on the whole energy sector.

question answered in the Roadmap: the Roadmap 
identifies a number of elements that have positive im-
pacts in all circumstances and, thus, define some key 
outcomes, such as the following.

(cid:116)(cid:1) Decarbonisation of the energy system is techni-
cally and economically feasible: all decarbonisa-
tion scenarios foresee the achievement of the re-
duction in emissions target and can be less costly 
than current policies in the long term.

(cid:116)(cid:1) Energy efficiency and renewable energy are 
critical: irrespective of the particular energy mix 
chosen, higher energy efficiency and important ris-
ing shares of renewables are necessary to meet the 
carbon dioxide targets in 2050 (115).

(cid:116)(cid:1) Early investments cost less: investment decisions 
for the necessary infrastructure up to 2030 must be 
taken now, as infrastructure built 30–40 years ago 
needs to be replaced. Acting immediately can avoid 
more costly changes in 20 years (116).

(cid:116)(cid:1) Contain the increase of prices: investments made 
now will pave the way for the best prices in the fu-
ture. Electricity prices are bound to rise until 2030, 
but can fall thereafter as a result of lower costs of 
supply, saving policies and improved technologies. 
The costs will be outweighed by the high level of 
sustainable investment brought into the European 
economy, the related local jobs, and the decreased 
import dependency.

(cid:116)(cid:1) Economies of scale are needed: a European ap-
proach will result in lower costs and secure sup-
ply compared to national parallel schemes. This 
includes a common energy market which should 
be completed by 2014.

The  Roadmap  ‘will  allow  Member  States  to  make 
the  required  energy  choices  and  create  a  stable 

(115)  The scenarios also show that electricity will play a greater 
role than now. Gas, oil, coal and nuclear also ﬁgure in all 
scenarios in diﬀerent proportions, allowing Member States 
to keep ﬂexible options in their energy mix provided a well-
connected internal market is achieved quickly.

(116)  The EU’s energy evolution requires, in any case, modernisa-
tion and much more ﬂexible infrastructure such as cross-
border interconnections, ‘intelligent’ electricity grids and 
modern low-carbon technologies to produce, transmit and 
store energy.

business climate for private investment, especially until 
2030’ (117), since the goal to cut greenhouse gas emis-
sions by 80–95 % by 2050 has serious implications for 
our energy system as well as the objective that two 
thirds of our energy should come from renewable 
sources.

2.4  Access to energy services as a human 

right in the EU

The major source of international human rights law is 
multilateral treaties between States such as the two 
1966 Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and Eco-
nomic, Social and Cultural Rights (118). To date, there are 
no international treaties that specifically and explicitly 
refer to access to energy services as a right. However, 
it can be argued that the right of access to modern 
energy services is already implicit in a range of exist-
ing human rights. It is increasingly apparent that the 
socioeconomic goals contained in the latter Covenant 
(hereafter CESCR) cannot be achieved without access 
to energy services. Article 11 CESCR sets out a num-
ber of rights essential for the realisation of the right 
to an adequate standard of living, including access to 
‘adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the con-
tinuous improvement in living conditions’. Access to 
energy services is fundamental to cooking, lightning, 
heating and cooling, and sewerage. Article 12 CESCR 
confers the right to the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health. The acquisition of such 
a standard is impossible without access to sustainable 
energy services. Not only is energy a prerequisite to 
the supply of hospital services and equipment but also 
the maintenance of health is compromised by the use 
of traditional fuels for cooking. Articles 6 and 7 CESCR 
establish the right to work. The majority of employ-
ment possibilities require access to sustainable energy. 
While very basic farming, manual work and craftwork 
may be an exception, access to lighting, heating and 
cooling, clean water, modern machinery, telephones 
and computers are basic requirements nowadays in 
order to truly meet the right to full and productive 
employment promoted by these articles. In particular, 
the right to safe and health working conditions, as set 
out in Article 7, is not possible without access to energy. 
Finally, Article 13 CESCR establishes the right to educa-

46An ethical framework for assessing research, production and use of energy2 | REGULATORY AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTtion. While it may be possible to educate children to a certain level without access to energy, the effective implementation of this right requires access to modern energy services. This interrelationship between energy services with other socioeconomic rights of fundamen-tal importance is evident in other international and re-gional instruments.With reference to the EU our analysis starts (119) with Article 6 TEU which states that: ‘The Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Char-ter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000, as adapted at Strasbourg, on 12 De-cember 2007, which shall have the same value as the Treaties’. Article 36 of the Charter provides that:The TEU and the TFEU do not define the term ‘services of general economic interest’ (hereafter SGEI). The European Commission and the European Court of Jus-tice have been left with the difficult task of providing the legal meaning of this term. The Commission, in its Green Paper on Services of General Interest referred to such services as ‘services of an economic nature which the Member States or the Community subject to spe-cific public service obligations by virtue of a general in-terest criterion. The concept of services of general eco-nomic interest thus covers in particular certain services provided by the big network industries such as trans-port, postal services, energy and communications’ (120). With regard to the provision of electric energy service, the Commission has taken the position that vertically integrated electric public utilities provide ‘services of general economic interest’ (121). The European Court of Justice has taken the same position (122).(119) Mainly based Avales, L. (2011), ‘Electric Energy Access in European Law: A Human Right?’, available online (http://ssrn.com/abstract=2008887).(120) Commission Green Paper on Services of General Interest, COM(2003) 270 ﬁnal of 21 May 2003, paragraph 17.(121) Commission Decision 91/50/EEC of 16 January 1991 relating to a proceeding under Article 85 of the EC Treaty.(122) Case C-392/92, Almelo v IJselmij [1994] ECR I-1277.Article 14 TFEU stresses the importance and special status of SGEI:The concept of SGEI thus establishes the right of every citizen to access certain services considered as essential and imposes obligations on industry to provide a de-fined service at specified conditions, including com-plete territorial coverage (123).Do the obligations imposed by European law on its institutions and Member States in relation to the SGEI undertakings create rights for the recipients of such services? For advocates of access to energy services as a human right, Article 36 of the Charter does not es-tablish this right. The phrase ‘recognises and respects’ implies that access to SGEI such as gas and energy is a principle of law insofar that such access is provided for in the national laws and practices of Member States. If Member States legislate the right to access to SGEI, then the EU Treaties recognise that right to access as a general principle of EU law. The EU principle of ac-cess to SGEI only means that the EU cannot take any legislative steps to curtail the access for EU citizens to SGEI providers entrusted by Member States with public service obligations.Even though it is the Member States that are compe-tent to impose public service obligations on SGEI pro-viders, the EU is attempting to provide some uniformity to these. Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parlia-ment and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning (123) Commission Green Paper on Services of General Interest, COM(2003) 270 ﬁnal of 21 May 2003, paragraph 50.The Union recognises and respects access to services of general economic interest as provided for in national laws and practices, in accordance with the Treaty es-tablishing the European Community, in order to pro-mote the social and territorial cohesion of the Union.Without prejudice to Article 4 of the Treaty on Euro-pean Union or to Articles 93, 106 and 107 of this Treaty, and given the place occupied by services of general economic interest in the shared values of the Union as well as their role in promoting social and territo-rial cohesion, the Union and the Member States, each within their respective powers and within the scope of application of the Treaties, shall take care that such services operate on the basis of principles and condi-tions, particularly economic and financial conditions, which enable them to fulfil their missions. The Euro-pean Parliament and the Council, acting by means of regulations in accordance with the ordinary legisla-tive procedure, shall establish these principles and set these conditions without prejudice to the competence of Member States, in compliance with the Treaties, to provide, to commission and to fund such services.47REGULATORY AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT | 2Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence (90).common rules for the internal market in electricity (Electricity Directive) is a major step in that direction. If properly implemented by the Member States, it will provide a series of rights of European citizens that, as a group, may define the elements of a European-wide right to energy access. Article 3 of the Electricity Di r-ective, Public service obligations and customer protec-tion, directs Member States to enact a series of rights. This leads authors, such as Luis Aviles, to the following conclusion and proposal: ‘Europe is close to recognis-ing that access to affordable energy should be a fun-damental right of EU citizens and it should do so in the next revision of the Charter’ (124).Finally, the human right to access to energy servic-es from the point of view of the Council of Europe should be noted. Although the European Convention of Human Rights does not mention a right to energy services, it could be argued that a Member State that allows its citizens to live without a modicum of electri-cal energy in their homes violates human dignity and possibly rights under Article 8(1) of the Convention:At least one national court has tackled this issue under the Convention: in 1988, the Court of Appeal in Brussels held that the enjoyment of electricity and gas services are indispensable to human dignity. The Court went on to say that public authorities have the positive duty to provide gas and electric service within the framework of social services (126).(124) Avales, L. (2011), ‘Electric Energy Access in European Law: A Human Right’ available online (http://ssrn.com/abstract=2008887).(125) Article 7 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights contains a comparable provision: ‘Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications’.(126) Decision of 25 February 1988, J.L.M.B. 1989, 1132.3.  Ethics

The European Community has taken the shape of 
a political community as a result of common beliefs, 
ideals and values. From the beginning, there was a con-
sensus that peace (the overarching goal of the unifica-
tion in post-war Europe) was to be achieved only on the 
basis of democracy. Furthermore, there was a shared 
belief that economic prosperity was bound to a free 
market and ‘movement without borders’ within the 
community — the latter being especially important 
with  respect  to  the  labour  market.  The  European 
Community, which, since its inception, has given pri-
macy to the respect of human dignity and to the pro-
tection of every individual human being, has endorsed 
these important ethical principles in the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Char-
ter indicates, inter alia, a set of values, such as human 
dignity, freedom, democracy, the respect for pluralism, 
non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and 
subsidiarity, as the milestones of the European Union 
and its policy design, which need to be incorporated in 
the EU policies. Energy is a policy sector, which cannot 
be exempted from this process. The relevance of an in-
tegrated ethics approach regarding the complex mul-
tilayer decision-making process of the energy policy is 
central and methodologically innovative.

While an ‘energy policy’ and ‘energy strategy’ have 
been established for the next few decades, it is far 
from clear what exactly the framework for ‘energy 
ethics’ may look like. In the 1970s, Hans Jonas intro-
duced his principle of responsibility for the era of sci-
ence, technology and knowledge societies, directing 
our attention towards a concept of responsibility that 
is not only concerned with implications of present 
or past actions, but rather with the implications of 
today’s action on future generations. Jonas’ approach 
is echoed in part in the implementation of the ‘pre-
cautionary principle’ in the legal EU framework, which 
reverses the burden of proof — the argument for 
the greater overall benefit of an action — in cases of 
expected harms or risk of envisioned technologies. 
More striking, however, is Jonas’ attention to long-
term effects for which present generations must 
shoulder their responsibility. This newly awakened 
consciousness and conscientiousness towards future 
generations is striking because it is only since the in-
dustrialisation in the 19th and 20th centuries that the 
impact of human action is such that it may destroy 
the very conditions of the well-being of future gener-
ations simply by continuing to live as we currently do. 
At the beginning of the 21st century, it has become 

clear that climate change, environmental damage, 
and radical changes in social conditions for billions 
of people today, and in the near future, demand that, 
with the development of industry and technology, 
the scope of our responsibility has also been broad-
ened: the way we live and use natural resources, the 
way we promote the development of any society and 
the choices we make today have an impact both in 
space (regional and global) and in time (present and 
in the future). The principle of sustainability emerged 
as a term that tries to embrace this new responsibil-
ity, particularly with respect to the impact of present 
actions on future generations.

The EU has responded to the challenge of the global 
and intergenerational responsibility by integrating 
ethics into its political and legal framework. The EGE 
supports the European Commission in spelling out the 
ethical dimension since new developments in science 
and new technologies demand new answers. This is 
clearly true in the area of energy. Yet, the task of spell-
ing out the integrated ethics approach of the EU en-
ergy policy differs from previous tasks because energy 
is a ‘horizontal’ issue (i.e. it is a necessary element of 
multiple policy fields, connecting, for example, the 
development of agriculture with urban development 
and architecture, transport systems with the stock 
market, international environmental politics and na-
tional security concerns, and the EU energy research 
agenda with the UN). Energy policy is also related to 
the need to provide clean and sufficient food and 
water to the population. The Millennium Develop-
ment Goals aim to fight poverty and promote eco-
nomic, social, and political development on a global 
scale — since ‘energy’ is the condition for the very 
state of modern societies — a responsible policy ap-
proach is called for in order to enable the EU to take 
into account the impact of the energy options in al-
most every sphere of modern society and transform 
today’s societies in such a way that neither one part 
of today’s world nor future generations’ well-being is 
sacrificed for the advantage of the other. Today, the 
EU should respond to this challenge not only because 
it has committed itself to do so, but also because: (a) 
its own history of industrialisation calls for it; (b) its 
dependence and vulnerability to imports demands 
prudent policy strategies; and (c) its research agenda 
is one of the strongest worldwide so that it seems to 
be feasible that the EU may play a crucial role in the 
development of sustainable energy technologies and 
energy saving technologies.

49

3 | ETHICS

The EU’s ambitious energy policy, aimed at a smart 
energy economy and ‘low-carbon society’ covering 
the full range of energy sources from fossil fuels (oil, 
gas and coal) to nuclear energy and renewables (solar, 
wind, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric and tidal) by 
2050, entailing an 80 % reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions, major improvements in energy efficiency 
and savings, and the goal that non-renewable energies 
are slowly replaced by renewable energies needs to 
be considered and analysed in relation to the Lisbon 
Treaty and the moral values enshrined in the Charter. 
The Lisbon Treaty provides a compromise between 
the promotion and facilitation of a common European 
energy policy and respect for subsidiarity and national 
sovereignty. An ethics framework is required in order 
to set the priorities which will provide the means for 
well-being, independent of where or when one hap-
pens to be born. Respect for fundamental human 
rights and European values, solidarity among the 
Member States of the European Union, and a prudent 
equilibrium between a common policy, competition 
between different energy plans, and national diver-
sification regarding energy sources are all necessary 
elements of such a framework. Any EU policy, the Lis-
bon Treaty states, is to be realised in a spirit of solidar-
ity between the Member States. In this spirit, the EU 
strives to secure the rights and enhance the well-being 
of all citizens.

A set of shared values exists in the EU that can serve as 
the guide to respect for national sovereignty and the 
necessity of a cooperative and common EU approach. 
Ethical goals for responsible decision-making (access 
to energy and security of supply, safety and precau-
tion, sustainability and responsibility, as well as social 
and intergenerational justice) can be extrapolated as 
common values from the Charter (127). The following 
fundamental values play a key role in the debate on 
energy.

1.  Respect for human dignity and human rights — 
among them, the right to healthcare and a safe 
environment, the right to access to energy as an 
important condition for basic human flourishing, 
the right to active democratic participation in the 
decision-making processes regarding energy poli-
cies and the right to transparency and information;

2.  Justice including distributive, social, political, and 

intergenerational justice.

3.  Solidarity identifies the shared responsibility and 
concern for EU and global welfare, which calls for 
cooperation in order to achieve the goal of securing 
the well-being of present and future generations.

These overarching rights and values guide the develop-
ment of an ethics framework oriented at a responsible 
design of the EU energy policy. Ethical criteria for re-
sponsible decision-making (access to energy, security 
of supply, sustainability and safety), can be extrapo-
lated from the Charter (128). However, their implementa-
tion is accompanied by several difficulties which need 
to be identified and spelled out explicitly.

3.1  Ethical concerns

Security of supply of energy was clearly an important 
economic factor for the establishment of the European 
Union, promoting interconnection and cooperation 
among states at a time when European citizens yearned 
for peace. For many decades, energy was taken for 
granted, assuming that it would always be available, af-
fordable and easily accessible. A number of events have 
made it clear that this is no longer the case, in particular, 
the realisation that fossil-based energy is non-renewable 
and will eventually be depleted. Even though huge re-
sources of gas and oil have recently been discovered 
or made accessible through new extraction techniques, 
the fossil reserves will eventually be depleted. Various 
documents on the international, European and national 
level have been written to emphasise the need to es-
tablish secure, safe, and sustainable energy policies and 
strategies. While the problems of security, diversification 
of energy supply and sufficient investment needed for 
secure energy delivery have been addressed, mainly 
from an economic perspective, not enough attention 
has been paid to the ethical issues related to the pro-
duction, processing, storage and distribution of energy.

Besides the obligation to secure energy, safety and sus-
tainability have become additional criteria which need 
to be considered in any energy policy. As stated in the 
previous chapter of this Opinion the Lisbon Treaty, in 
Article 191, commits to the contribution and pursuit 
of environmental objectives (to preserve, protect and

energy; and (d) promoting the interconnection of energy 
networks (130).

Environmental policies will therefore strive to direct 
the economic competition towards ensuring energy 
security, while preventing present and future environ-
mental damage of the sort that accompanied the in-
dustrialisation of the 19th and 20th centuries. An equi-
librium between economy prosperity, environmental 
sustainability, and social welfare or the well-being of 
individuals needs to be reached in all EU policies, and 
in energy policies in particular.

Economic

Social well-
being 

Europe’s energy policy becomes one of the greatest tests 
that Europe has to face in the coming decades. It is im-
portant to address the EU energy policy in the light of the 
Lisbon Treaty’s Energy Policy objectives: (a) ensuring the 
functioning of the energy market; (b) ensuring energy 
security; (c) promoting energy efficiency and energy sav-
ing, and the development of new and renewable forms of 

(129)  Article 191: 

1. Union policy on the environment shall contribute to pur-
suit of the following objectives: —preserving, protecting and 
improving the quality of the environment, — protecting hu-
man health, — prudent and rational utilisation of natural re-
sources, — promoting measures at international level to deal 
with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in 
particular combating climate change. 
2. Union policy on the environment shall aim at a high level 
of protection taking into account the diversity of situations 
in the various regions of the Union. It shall be based on the 
precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive 
action should be taken, that environmental damage should as 
a priority be rectiﬁed at source and that the polluter should pay.

These four main objectives of EU energy policy need to 
be implemented in such a way that they can respond to 
the following challenges facing us today:

security of supply;

affordable access to all users;

increasing dependence on imports,

climate change and the necessity to enable the transi-
tion to renewable energy;

strain on energy resources;

the issue of diversity of energy mix;

the need of a coherent external energy policy;

the equilibrium between the principle of subsidiarity 
and autonomy of Member States;

solidarity among Member States; and

funding of research that encourages innovation in 
all areas of energy technology, and that ensures the 
competitiveness of the European economy.

In this chapter, the EGE identifies some ethical concerns 
related to the debate on research required to achieve 
a sustainable energy mix. The group spells out the four 
ethical criteria or ‘pillars’ of ethical analysis, which need 
to be integrated in energy policy strategies: the right to 
access to energy, energy security, energy sustainability 
and energy safety.

3.1.1 

Justice as a horizontal principle

The EGE emphasises that these four criteria (access to 
energy, security of supply, sustainability, and safety) 

(130)  Article 194: 

1. In the context of the establishment and functioning of the 
internal market and with regard for the need to preserve and 
improve the environment, Union policy on energy shall aim, 
in a spirit of solidarity between Member States, to: (a) ensure 
the functioning of the energy market; (b) ensure security of 
energy supply in the Union; (c) promote energy eﬃciency 
and energy saving and the development of new and renew-
able forms of energy; and (d) promote the interconnection of 
energy networks.

51

 
 
 
 
3 | ETHICS

are complemented by a horizontal principle (justice), 
which is the foundation for the realisation of human 
dignity and human rights. Justice is ‘horizontal’ or 
crossing across the four ethical criteria referred to in 
the previous paragraph because the concept of justice 
embraces a number of elements:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

‘justice as equity’ which is the basis of justice as the 
guarantee of equal human right to well-being and, 
hence, the right to access of energy as the condition 
of human flourishing;

‘commutative justice’ which refers to the economic 
cooperation and, among others, the rules of fair-
ness in international trade;

‘distributive justice’ which guarantees the fair dis-
tribution of energy and accompanies the difficult 
issue of access to energy;

‘social justice’ which guarantees that the interests 
of those most vulnerable and disadvantaged in 
the present generation and the well-being of fu-
ture generations are equally safeguarded through 
security of reliable and affordable supply of energy 
and safety issues;

‘participatory justice’ which accompanies the re-
quirement for democratic, participatory decision-
processes (e.g. regarding the energy sources and 
energy mix of a given country and/or the EU, re-
garding the priority-setting of the criteria to which 
we will return later, or regarding the question of 
safety and risk acceptance);

‘intergenerational justice’ which underpins sustain-
ability and advocates that the rights and interests 
of future generations are to be taken seriously into 
account in any decision-making process of the pre-
sent generation;

‘environmental justice’ which safeguards the eco-
logical balance of nature, protects and promotes 
ecological diversity, and requires the development 
of a sustainable economy in order to preserve the 
‘common heritage’ of mankind’.

While the relation between justice and human rights is 
very tight, the EGE does not wish to apply or promote 
an exclusively ‘anthropocentric’ approach to the en-
ergy debate. Rather, the group acknowledges that the 
natural resources which past and present generations 
have utilised, and are utilising for the purpose of their 

well-being, are the very basis of human life and flour-
ishing. Without the transcendence of our moral respon-
sibilities beyond myopic human needs and desires, the 
basis of human flourishing would be endangered and 
would not serve future generations in the same way 
as ours. The negative ramifications of climate change 
are but one reminder of the simple truth that our one 
and only planet Earth is the environment for all living 
beings and must not be tampered with.

Hence, the EU’s energy policy should embrace those 
strategies of responsibility which create the best pos-
sible equilibrium of environmental protection, promo-
tion of well-being, and economic prosperity. Without 
solidarity among the European Member States and the 
international community, this equilibrium will not be 
achieved. Social justice demands also a sense of solidar-
ity with the whole family of ‘humankind’. The current 
generation has a moral obligation to regulate its cur-
rent consumption in order to share its resources with 
the poor and with future generations. The one solid 
factor for asserting that it is the obligation of present 
generations to care about possible and probable future 
generations or, alternatively, that future generations 
have claims on us, which can only be advocated for 
by the present generation, is the unity and solidarity 
of mankind. There is no social justice without sharing 
and participation. The intergenerational community of 
humankind becomes just when present generations 
learn to share the resources of the earth with all cur-
rent and future members of the human species. Global 
and intergenerational sharing moves us beyond the old 
model of development to a radical rethinking leading 
to fundamental structural change.

Participation is at the very core of social and politi-
cal justice. All members of the human species have 
the same fundamental dignity and right. Since the 
resources of the earth are the ‘common heritage of 
humankind’, all members of the human species have 
the right not only to share in the common goods of 
the earth, but also to participate in their management.

3.2  Societal impact

Public policies on energy production, storage and dis-
tribution may have an immense impact on the well-
being and the quality of life of citizens. Security of ener-
gy supply is essential to guarantee basic human needs. 
Safety is a necessary condition for the protection of 
health and the environment. If the EU energy policy 
(both the 2020 strategy and the Energy Roadmap 2050) 
is successful, it will, in part, improve the health and

overall well-being of EU citizens who will less and less 
be exposed to hazardous wastes and emissions associ-
ated with fossil fuels, or to the emissions and risks of 
atomic energy production and waste storage.

In addition, decisions on energy technologies raise 
questions about political decision-making including 
the participatory public debate on the choices of en-
ergy sources, the distribution of costs and risks, storage 
of waste, and transparency about the side effects of 
any energy technologies. EU energy policy must not 
only find an equilibrium between economy, ecology, 
and social issues, but also — as part of the processes of 
democratic deliberations — between a decentralised 
and centralised implementation of energy technolo-
gies, on the one hand, and bottom-up and top-down 
policy decision-making processes on the other hand: 
local energy decisions may have an impact on the na-
tional energy policy and may jeopardise the EU goals of 
a secure, safe, and sustainable energy strategy.

The precautionary principle requires an assessment of 
risk and, when necessary, its minimisation. No energy 
source is without some form of impact on the fabric of 
society. Due to the varying economic and environmen-
tal impacts of renewable energy systems, the transition 
to sustainable energy may also have significant social 
consequences. For example, the development of re-
newable energy systems may change the structures 
of employment in certain regions, depending on their 
industrial base and on their reliance on non-renewable 
energy sources. A decentralised energy strategy could 
increase consumer choice regarding households’ en-
ergy suppliers with respect to the EU dependency on 
energy import; furthermore, changes in the supply 
chains may have an impact on international relations, 
changing political relations internationally as certain 
nations end their reliance on others for energy.

It is equally important to stress that changes in com-
munal and individual attitudes and practices are an 
integral aspect of every public policy on energy: best 
practice on how to use energy more efficiently, save 
costs and reduce waste is one of the pillars of the Lisbon 
Treaty — and that cannot only mean the development 
of more efficient technologies. Public authorities can 
lead by example and apply energy efficiency criteria in 
all public procurement of works, services or products. 
One could think of social competitions regarding crea-
tive ideas to save energy, or providing incentives for 
individuals, communities, or even regions, to transform 
their individual, social, and economic habits (e.g. in ar-
chitecture, urban development, the use of common 

ground within cities, transportation of goods or public 
transportation). The consequences of particular uses 
of energy (local, national, supranational and global) 
should be faced in order to raise awareness of individual 
and collective responsibility for energy security. Since 
energy touches the core of human multi-relationships, 
the engagement of public participation in the decision-
making process concerning energy policies is crucial in 
a democratic society. Transparency is, therefore, needed 
to enable citizens and democratic bodies to make in-
formed choices on supranational, national, regional or 
local energy needs and systems.

3.3  Economic impact

Humanity’s ability to extract and exploit fossil fuels 
has been the catalyst for technological and industrial 
development that has led to unprecedented socio-
economic prosperity in many regions of the world. 
Until recently, security of supply was the main concern 
from an economic perspective: as shown in Chapter 1 
of this Opinion, economic development in the 19th and 
20th centuries emerged with the assumption that the 
natural resources, which were necessary for industrial 
progress, could be exploited without major costs to ei-
ther individuals or societies, or the environment. Energy, 
therefore, became an object of economic deliberation 
because of the economic power of those countries that 
could dictate (and continue to do so) the price and sup-
ply of energy on the global market. For the EU, the high 
dependency on imports makes it especially vulnerable 
to the volatility of the market, and it raises many ques-
tions concerning the security of supply. Energy saving 
and energy efficiency has become part of an inherent 
economic strategy to reduce (or at least to stabilise) en-
ergy costs. In this situation, reliance on one source is cer-
tainly not a prudent strategy and, therefore, the EU has 
long encouraged the use of an energy mix. For a long 
time, it was believed that market competition would it-
self result in a move towards efficient solutions, but the 
international, European, and national energy structures 
have not succeeded in transforming the energy market 
into a ‘healthy’ energy mix addressing social, environ-
mental, sustainability and safety concerns. Proponents 
of non-renewable energy systems argue that fossil fuels 
continue to be much more economically feasible than 
renewable energy sources, while proponents of renew-
able energy, too, argue for the positive economic bal-
ance of these systems. The Energy Roadmap 2050 (131) 

(131)  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.

do?uri=CELEX:52011DC0885:EN:NOT

53

3 | ETHICS

demonstrates that a mix of non-renewable and renew-
able energy is the only realistic option in the short and 
medium term to respond to energy needs and, at the 
same time, maintain energy prices which are economi-
cally feasible. The main issue is that demand for energy 
is increasing exponentially worldwide (in particular in 
emerging economies) and that the global energy de-
mand requires urgent action.

Since any EU energy policy has to establish an equi-
librium between the economic, environmental and 
social dimensions, it must ensure that there is not only 
fair competition but also transparency of energy costs, 
emissions, risks, social and environmental impact of the 
utilisation of natural resources and the general ration-
ale concerning energy efficiency and energy saving as 
well as the interconnection and cooperation. The over-
all costs of every energy source, including all hidden 
and external costs (such as those involved in the entire 
life cycle of the source, from development, production, 
transport, distribution, storage, maintenance, waste 
storage, environmental and human impact to the in-
surance and indirect costs of safety measures) must 
be objective and available. The external costs — plan-
ning, construction, operation, networking and costly 
emergency planning systems, on the national, regional 
and international level — should be taken into account. 
The costs of these contributions, such as the costs of 
environmental damage and the costs of dismantling 
a technological structure of current energy sources 
may or may not be included in the costs calculated. 
What is needed is an economic policy of ‘true process’ 
(i.e. with all external costs included, rather than a policy 
of ‘cheap’ energy).

3.4  Environmental impact

Any energy source has an environmental impact if the 
whole cycle from retrieval to distribution to waste stor-
age is considered. As elaborated in the first part of the 
Opinion, the group of non-renewable energy sources 
is as diverse with respect to the different sources as is 
the group of renewables, which, per se, have a better 
environmental balance.

Future generations are likely to be disadvantaged by 
the environmental impact caused by irresponsible de-
cisions and use of energy sources. Since both spatial 
and temporal dimensions of the consequences of hu-
man activity play a crucial role in the ethics of energy, 
the present generation faces the ethical challenge 
to broaden its moral perspective by taking seriously 
into account the long-term effects of its decisions and 

actions on posterity. This challenge is based on the 
demands of social justice that appeal to the principle 
that a community has the moral duty to give particular 
help to those who are disadvantaged out of human 
solidarity.

The ethical challenge to protect future generations 
stems  from  the  fact  they  are  in  a  disadvantaged 
position with respect to the present generation which 
has the power to affect their quality of life. They are 
disadvantaged  for  three  reasons:  firstly,  they  are 
‘downstream’ in time from us and thus subject to the 
long-term consequences of our actions; secondly, the 
scope of their choices is restricted by decisions taken 
by their predecessors; thirdly, future generations are 
inherently disadvantaged since they are ‘mute’, having 
no representatives among the present generation, and 
so their interests are often neglected in present socio-
economic and political planning.

3.5  Comparative approach

In order to address the ethical issues that arise from 
changes to an energy mix and the research that is need-
ed to ensure effective delivery of energy to citizens, it is 
crucial to provide comparative data on all energy pro-
duction systems throughout their ‘life cycle’ to enable 
comparison. The need is complicated by requirements 
to examine the full cycle of energy production in both 
scientific and social terms. Taking coal as an example, 
the mining of the coal is a hazardous occupation both 
for the miners and for those living in close proximity to 
the coal mines due to accidents in the mines and envi-
ronmental impacts — especially in modern opencast 
mines — and health impacts due to dust and pollution. 
Coal mining communities are traditionally close-knit 
communities, where any changes have major social 
impacts. This is followed by the need to transport the 
material to the plants processing the coal or using it for 
generation of electricity. Without treatment and some 
form of carbon capture associated with the coal-fired 
plants, pollution due to partially combusted particular 
matter can impact on health and the environment in 
the proximity of the plant, and nuclear radiation, inher-
ent in the coal, may also be a problem. The combustion 
of coal produces carbon, nitrogen and sulphur com-
pounds that significantly contribute to the environmen-
tal damage unless properly addressed in the treatment 
of the effluent. Whilst the reserves of coal are great, they 
are not infinite, and they are not renewable.

In the case of nuclear power, there is a risk of a devas-
tating hazard — the meltdown of the fission material

and containment facilities causing both the equivalent 
of a nuclear bomb, in the worst of cases, to the uncon-
trolled release of radioactive material with resultant 
impacts on human health and the environment. The 
long half-life of some nuclear materials means that 
where such a problem happens, its effects may last 
for thousands of years. Once the fuel used in nuclear 
plants is exhausted, the remaining radioactive material 
has to be stored safely in a manner that minimises the 
risk to human health and the environment, possibly 
for thousands of years. In many cases, this storage of 
nuclear waste has proven to be the greatest challenge 
in the use of nuclear energy, which adds to the risk of 
hazards (132). Nuclear fuels are also non-renewables that 
are mined.

In transitioning to renewable energies, the EU needs 
to assess the relative environmental impact of the dif-
ferent ‘green technologies in order to find the best 
possible solutions. For example, the green, renewable 
energy systems may also have a negative environmen-
tal impact because of the need for storage systems and 
distribution technologies. However, renewable energy 
systems that utilise water, solar or wind to produce 
power create no carbon dioxide emissions once they 
are constructed and, therefore, do not contribute to the 
negative effects of climate change during this phase 
of their use. Still, hydropower projects, such as dams, 
can negatively affect fish and wildlife by obstructing 
natural water flows, and the massive water reservoirs 
they create may irreversibly change the surrounding 
ecosystem. They may also disrupt communities and 
change the way in which they interact with their envi-
ronment. Other concerns about environmental impacts 
refer to arable land sustainability and food security 
(the amount of agricultural land that may be required 
to generate significant levels of biomass energy and 
biofuels), the amount of air pollution that stems from 
inappropriate use in comparison to other renewable 
systems, etc.

Even windmills provide environmental headaches — 
they are noisy, and may impact on bird and insect eco-
systems. The production of the electronics and genera-
tion systems may also have environmental and health 
consequences, and the storage of electricity when an 
excess is produced is a problem. Each technology has 
its pros and cons, and a comparative analysis of the 

(132)  h t t p : // e c . e u r o p a . e u / e n e r g y / n u c l e a r / s a f e t y /

stress_tests_en.htm

merits and demerits of using a particular source of en-
ergy is necessary.

3.6  The four ethical criteria for an ethical 

assessment

Various documents on the international, European and 
national level have been written to emphasise the need 
to establish secure and sustainable energy policies and 
strategies. The problems of security, diversification of 
energy supply and sufficient investment needed for 
secure energy delivery have been addressed mainly 
from an economic perspective; however, not enough 
attention has been paid to the ethical issues related to 
the production, processing, storage and distribution 
of energy.

The energy challenge is one of the greatest tests that 
Europe has to face. It is therefore essential for the 
European Union to address, within an ethical approach 
(environmentally, economically and socially compat-
ible), its main criteria of energy policy:

1.  Access to energy

2.  Security of EU energy supply

3.  Sustainability

4.  Safety.

3.6.1  Access to energy

Energy is a fundamental factor in the provision of many 
vital services which improve the quality of life and en-
able economic and social development: transporta-
tion, comfortable indoor temperatures, agriculture, 
food production, preservation and cooking, health 
services, lighting, communication and information, 
commercial and industrial processes. ‘Energy poverty’ 
reduces or even threatens people’s well-being (e.g. by 
reducing their chances to flourish and participate in 
social and economic life). The history of energy con-
sumption shows how important energy is to the qual-
ity of human life. Accordingly, the disruption of energy 
supply and a lack of adequate, reliable, diverse and af-
fordable access to energy sources affects human rights. 
This is why ‘energy security’ has risen to the top of the 
political agenda in the 21st century. Inequalities in ac-
cess to affordable energy have given rise to inequalities 
in social security and standards of living. Energy should 
be available to individuals at a level that allows them 
to achieve their personal security and aspirations while 

55

56An ethical framework for assessing research, production and use of energy3 | ETHICSnot compromising the environment and the rights of others. The promotion of national or international wel-fare must therefore consider access to energy as a key goal for all actors involved in energy policy.3.6.2 Security of EU energy supplyKey terms for the ethical evaluation of future energy supply are sustainability and security of supply. The goal of security of supply entails not only reducing im-port dependency but also increasing supply diversity and the stability of the electricity and gas grids. The EU’s experiences of gas supply interruptions in early 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010, its strong dependence on imports of petroleum products, and the geopoliti-cal uncertainty in many producer regions, led to the adoption of the regulation concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply (133).Risks associated with the security of supply are those related to a high dependence on foreign sources of energy imported from a limited number of suppliers (the EU-27 currently imports 83.5 % of its oil and 64.2 % of its gas consumption; overall, import dependency is around 54 % and is projected to slightly increase by 2050 (134)), including supplies from politically unstable regions; gradual depletion of fossil fuel resources and rising global competition for energy resources; increas-(133) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:295:0001:0022:EN:PDF(134) http://www.european-council.europa.eu/media/171257/ec04.02.2011-factsheet-energy-pol_ﬁnaldg.en.pdfFigure 3.6.1:  Illustration of access to energy as a first priority (Example A)EXAMPLE A: FIRST PRIORITY — ACCESS TO ENERGYIf global energy security — based on every human being’s right of access to energy as a condition of their well-being — is the first priority of policies, the EU’s concerns for its own energy security, safety standards, environmental concerns and, potentially, also national sovereignty are secondary to the achievement of this goal. Energy production and utilisation will include any available source on earth, and a regional approach will complement the global approach. When it comes to striking a balance between social, economic and environ-mental concerns, access rights will ‘trump’ the other two areas of concern: a longer-term view can be taken of environmental concerns, research can be directed towards the short-term use of energy sources (e.g. fracking) and safety criteria may be relaxed in the interests of economic prosperity. Global development economics are linked to more energy use and, in the short term at least, demand can be met only by the increased exploitation of natural resources. A new wave of oil drilling, fracking and nuclear energy in many parts of the world underlines that economic prosperity really is the number one priority for global energy policy.Sustainability/environmentalresponsibilityAccess to energy ashuman rightSafety:imminent, indirect,long termEconomicprosperity;independence;sovereignityConsequences in case of conflicting goals:Global approach, linked to overall struggle to fight poverty:(cid:116)(cid:1)People before environment(cid:116)(cid:1)Produce and supply as much energy as possible(cid:116)(cid:1)Minimal safety standards: acceptable risks(cid:116)(cid:1)Climate change as long-term goal, but rights of present generation comes first(cid:116)(cid:1)Economic prosperity to be considered as global goal (Development goals: energy as tool/means to development), global justice ‘regime’ necessary to meet the goal57ETHICS | 3ing electrification from more variable sources (e.g. solar PV and wind) which poses new challenges to the grid to ensure uninterrupted delivery of electricity; low re-silience to natural or man-made disasters and adverse effects of climate change.Given that the EU has set energy targets and that, at the same time, Member States are free (in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity) to decide their energy mix, a paradigm shift is needed in the ethical assess-ment of security of supply, which should be based on an integrated approach taking into account:(cid:116)(cid:1)solidarity in energy policies (no country can resolve the energy production issues on its own);(cid:116)(cid:1)dependency and vulnerability: the energy mix should not depend on one source alone (ethical basis of dependency);(cid:116)(cid:1)the need for energy to be produced safely, in an environmentally and socially compatible manner and at competitive prices (covering all costs); mech-anisms for sourcing energy should not adversely impact on food or water security; and the need for an adequate infrastructure to deliver energy.3.6.3 SustainabilityThe key term for the ethical evaluation of future energy supply is sustainability. With the guiding criterion of sustainability, the objective of environmental compati-bility stands alongside social equilibrium and economic efficiency for collectively achieving a future-oriented structure for society. The challenge is to build a respon-sible energy future through sustainable development which means helping to meet the world’s growing energy needs in economically, environmentally, and socially responsible ways. Contributing to sustainable development means consciously balancing short and Figure 3.6.2: Illustration of security of EU energy supply as first priority (Example B)EXAMPLE B: FIRST PRIORITY — SECURITY OF ENERGY SUPPLYIf energy security of supply within the EU is the first policy priority, then safety standards, environmental con-cerns and national decisions concerning the energy mix are secondary to the achievement of this goal. Energy production will come from any available sources conducive to the aim of the EU to acquire self-sustainability in the energy sector. The EU’s dependency on imported energy will be considered as a threat to overall prosper-ity and any steps to greater independence will be welcomed. It is clear, however, that economic considerations will ‘trump’ other areas of concern: a longer term view can be taken of environmental concerns while research is directed towards the short term use of energy sources (e.g. fracking), the global struggle against energy poverty may well be delayed for short term EU benefits, and even safety criteria may be relaxed in the interests of economic prosperity linked to security of energy supply. The question then is whether this priority-setting is compatible with the EU ethical framework, which clearly seeks to promote an ethically sound energy policy that safeguards the balance between social, environmental and economic concerns.

long-term interests and integrating economic, environ-
mental and social considerations into energy decisions.

Sustainable development criteria have been pushed to 
the front line of energy policy. In the light of concerns 
about climate change due to human enhancement of 
the greenhouse effect, there is growing concern about 
how energy needs are addressed on a sustainable ba-
sis. Until about 20 years ago, energy sustainability was 
thought of simply in terms of availability relative to the 
rate of use. Today, in the context of the ethical frame-
work of sustainable development, including, particu-
larly, concerns about global warming, other aspects 
are also very important. These include environmental 
effects and the question of wastes, even if they have 
no immediate environmental effect.

The principle of sustainable development, as defined in 
the Report of the Brundtland Commission (135), Our Com-
mon Future, implies that the present consumption of 
energy be examined in light of the foreseeable needs of 
future generations. The Brundtland Commission’s defi-
nition includes not only sustainability’s environmental 
dimensions, but its economic and social aspects as well. 
It underlines the need to maintain economic growth 
and reduce poverty by providing more energy. Changes 
in people’s lifestyles also help to save energy if they 
respect nature and are sustained as a basis for supply.

Responsibility for future generations therefore also 
extends in particular to the provision of energy and 
a fair distribution of risks and burdens in the long term. 
A sound ethical policy on the responsible and sustain-
able use of energy technologies should involve both 
a wide human environmental context and a long-term 
horizon. As George Bernard Shaw so succinctly put it: 
‘We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, 
but by the responsibility for our future.’ Now, as never 
before, we understand clearly the possible impact of 
the decisions we take today on the lives of those who 
will follow us. At the same time, we possess the right 
information and the proper tools to act to ensure that 
economic growth and an improved quality of life do 
not necessarily result in increased resource use and 
pollution. We, thus, have the opportunity to exercise 
our responsibility and to assess the need to redefine 
human development in terms that go beyond the 
strictly economic, so as to establish a genuine vision 
of sustainability that is viable for decision-makers.

Since the production and use of energy can be a threat 
to the environment, energy sources should be renew-
able in order to be sustainable. Hence, urgent action 
needs to be taken to safeguard the environment for 
present and future generations. This involves reduc-
tions in the negative environmental consequences of 
energy exploration, production, and storage and dis-
tribution. Moreover, renewable sources of energy must 
be developed and combinations of renewable energy 
strategies must be found to facilitate the transition 
from non-sustainable to sustainable energy supply. 
We have specific duties towards future generations: 
the resources must be exploited in as economical and 
rational a manner as possible, above all when we know 
full well that a large part of the non-renewable energy 
resources may be depleted within one or two centu-
ries. There is, therefore, a duty at every level to limit 
energy consumption and wastage. The exploitation of 
a resource whose disappearance could threaten the ex-
istence of entire industries requires that governments 
view energy control policies as a major aspect of their 
development programmes. Environmentally friendly 
technologies and consumption structures have to be 
developed, distributed, maintained and expanded in 
all parts of the world.

Reductions in energy consumption can be brought 
about by changing people’s attitudes and educating 
consumers to adopt new lifestyles. We highly rec-
ommend the promotion of sustainability in schools. 
Citizens’ participation in energy transition policies 
empowers  them  to  control  consumption.  Incen-
tives for energy-efficient urban renovation are to be 
encouraged.

The central criterion for the evaluation of an energy 
technology must be: Does the technology support 
or hinder sustainable development or is it neutral? To 
comply with the requirements of sustainability, an en-
ergy technology must be:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

socially, environmentally and (macro-)economically 
sound and socially acceptable;

(cid:116)(cid:1) within human grasp (e.g. all potential technical, 
social and environmental consequences can be 
comprehensibly assessed);

(cid:116)(cid:1) flexible (e.g. requires follow-up measures through 
centuries and is tied to large units, difficult to steer 
due to intrinsic dynamics);

(135)  http://www.un-documents.net/wced-ocf.htm

tolerant to errors, failures and misuse.

59ETHICS | 33.6.4 SafetyThe notion of risk postulates a negative consequence and the likelihood of it happening, which depends on the degree of hazard and exposure. The definition of negative effects is context-dependent — sociocul-tural factors play a central role in defining the ‘negative’ consequence (e.g. death, illness, natural degradation, economic vulnerability, choice and social control) and impact the entire risk assessment process. Risk also in-cludes the broad range of cultural, social and psycho-logical consequences that give rise to different types of public perceptions. A comprehensive concept of risk and safety includes the dimensions of security of sup-ply and economic stability as well as environmental protection. Environmental, economic, social and tech-nical risks are closely interlinked. All the risks involved in all sources of energy must be adequately evaluated, assessed, and communicated to society.The starting point for risk assessment is the reason-ing that there can never be zero risk and that the risks when using mineral oil, gas, coal, biomass, hydropower, wind, solar power and nuclear energy are different but can be critically compared. As none of the energy op-tions is risk-free, the judgement for acceptability rests on a comparative assessment of the anticipated con-sequences of all available options on the basis of the above mentioned multilayer assessment criteria. This requires all of the risks and opportunities to be evalu-ated as well as is scientifically possible, whereby direct and indirect consequences over the whole life cycle must be included. Alongside the scale of the conse-quences, the probability of their occurrence should also be taken into account. In connection with the im-pact evaluation, the risks and opportunities must be weighed up against each other. Ethical considerations assist in making the most rational and fairest assess-ment possible.The previous consideration applies on a case-by-case basis to whatever technology is scrutinised in its entire life cycle. Reducing the risks down to purely technical aspects would not fulfil the requirement for Figure 3.6.3: Illustration of sustainability/environmental responsibility as first priority (Example C)EXAMPLE C: FIRST PRIORITY — SUSTAINABILITYIf sustainability is the first priority of the energy policy, it certainly challenges the current energy economics: the promotion of nuclear energy, fracking, or even new forms of coal and oil mining will need to be reinterpreted in light of the priority of sustainability. The goal of transforming EU industry, households, transport systems, etc., will all be assessed in light of their contribution to either the ongoing pollution of the environment or the use of natural resources. The transition to renewable energies will need to be promoted more consistently, and research will need to be redirected if it does not pass the test of this criterion. Whether the priority of sustainability can be harmonised with the social and economic issues stated above without threatening either prosperity or social rights remains to be seen. Consequences in case of conflicting goals:(cid:116)(cid:1)International/global policies(cid:116)(cid:1)Produce as sustainable as possible(cid:116)(cid:1)Liability with producers(cid:116)(cid:1)Future well-being is equal to well-being of present generations(cid:116)(cid:1)Sustainability has priority to safety standards or prosperity and energy securitySafety:imminent, indirect,long termSustainability/environmentalresponsibilityEconomicprosperity;independence;sovereignityAccess to energy ashuman right60An ethical framework for assessing research, production and use of energy3 | ETHICSan integrated approach and comprehensive assess-ment. Consequences in terms of the environment and health should receive the same amount of attention as the cultural, social, economic, individual and insti-tutional implications. A safety culture embraced by governments and operating organisations is neces-sary in the production, storage and distribution of energy in maintaining a low level of risk. A rational choice of energy sources should involve a comparison of the risks presented by the various energy chains available.Equally important is the relationship between the probabilistic considerations and the magnitude of the consequences of the risk associated to the use of a given technology. A critical assessment is especially important, in particular when the consequences of energy technologies assume the character of ‘eternal burdens’.3.7 ConclusionsThe EU’s aim of a smart energy economy, in which en-ergy is more secure, competitive and sustainable, can-not be adequately delivered without the underpinning of a proper set of ethical criteria that promotes and facil-itates the implementation of a common (harmonised) European energy policy, based on solidarity between Member States, which also serves as a reliable guide to the EU’s priority-setting in energy research and use. Every decision that a country takes on energy sources is ultimately based on society’s value judgements, over and above technical and economic considerations. It is, therefore, important that European institutions fos-ter a value system that promotes harmonisation and consistency in research, development and capacity-building in the field of energy. Since the manner in which energy is provided has become highly critical, the EU is facing the challenge of promoting a strategic view in the areas of research and development activity based on a sound common ethical perspective and not Figure 3.6.4: Illustration of safety as first priority (Example D)EXAMPLE D: FIRST PRIORITY — SAFETYIf safety is considered the first priority of any energy policy, comparative risk assessment studies will put the whole life cycle of any energy source (i.e. production, storage, distribution, transport and waste) under scrutiny. Safety is directly connected to people’s health, and this priority may easily conflict with the goal of energy secu-rity. As in the first scenario (Access to energy), but unlike the second scenario (Security of energy supply), safety standards must be implemented internationally if considered from an ethical perspective. But, EU research could provide the means to study the ramifications and risks of non-renewable and renewable energy sources alike. This priority belongs to the area of ‘social’ concerns, and is easily linked to environmental concerns too — insofar as environmental hazards easily translate into social risks or health issues. However, if safety ‘trumps’ any demand for energy security, it will become crucial to examine the criteria for risks. The precautionary principle is helpful in this respect, but it seems to be based on alternatives which might not be available in the sector of energy.Consequences in case of conflicting goals:(cid:116)(cid:1)International/global policies(cid:116)(cid:1)Produce as safe as possible(cid:116)(cid:1)Liability with producers(cid:116)(cid:1)Precautionary Principle/Proportionality(cid:116)(cid:1)Present well-being is equal to well-being of future generations(cid:116)(cid:1)Safety has priority to sustainability stand-ards or prosperity and energy securitySustainability/environmentalresponsibilitySafety:imminent, indirect,long termAccess to energy ashuman rightEconomicprosperity;independence;sovereignityETHICS | 3

ble future policy orientations at the EU level by their 
main social, economic, and environmental goals;

(cid:116)(cid:1)

show trade-offs among different policy objectives;

(cid:116)(cid:1) help policymakers set milestones.

The well-being of present and future generations ul-
timately depends not only on the identification but 
also on the prioritisation of sound ethical criteria that 
enlighten and empower all stakeholders involved in 
the field of energy policies to reach an equilibrium 
of the social, economic and environmental concerns. 
The EU’s ambitious energy policy cannot be reached 
without a collective effort, in a spirit of solidarity and 
justice, to analyse continuously in a critical way the dif-
ferent energy-related technologies, on a case-by-case 
basis, in the light of the ethical matrix discussed in the 
previous sections which mirror the ethical principles 
enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the 
European Union. This is the only way forward in the 
field of energy for the benefit of both present and fu-
ture generations!

just a tactical approach based on cost reduction and 
the prospect of abundant short-term resources. The EU 
needs a moral vision that throws light on the structural 
and technological changes in order to move forward 
towards smart energy technology by 2050. This revo-
lution or paradigm shift in energy systems needs to 
be accompanied by ethical criteria that guide public 
policy decisions.

In order to meet the energy challenge — how to pro-
vide everyone with sufficient energy to sustain their 
human dignity and health and to achieve their individ-
ual potential without damaging the carrying-capacity 
of the environment to sustain humans and other living 
species — all possible sources of energy must be ob-
jectively examined. It must be accepted that different 
solutions will be appropriate in different places and 
that they may change over time. It is a known fact that 
Europe’s objective is to ultimately move to renewable, 
non-polluting energy sources and that, for this reason, 
the transition to such sources must be accelerated. The 
extraordinary complexity of the issue of energy em-
phasises the need to consider the full range of social, 
cultural, economic, technical, political and environmen-
tal barriers for making genuine and morally acceptable 
progress.

What seems to be needed is robust monitoring and 
continuous evaluation of each energy source. This 
requires the guidance of an appropriately designed 
ethical matrix or measurement tool in the context of 
both research prioritisation and technological devel-
opment that ultimately reflects the ethical principles 
enshrined in the Charter. Responsible and reason-
able balancing of options in the domain of research 
and use of our energy mix, particularly in critical and 
conflicting situations, calls for the ethical guidance of 
a sound and consistent roadmap that guarantees the 
right to access, security of supply, competitiveness, 
safety and sustainability. These objectives are not eas-
ily reconcilable.

The four ethical criteria which the EGE has identified 
in this chapter as requirements for any analysis of en-
ergy sources and utilisation, translate differently into 
the three main areas of social, economic, environmen-
tal concern. These assessment criteria are needed to 
evaluate and compare the complexity of different en-
ergy-related technologies and, at the same time, throw 
light on their future development. The main objective 
of these ethical criteria is to:

61

4.  Recommendations

Fossil fuels were the energy source that shaped 19th 
and 20th century life. Global energy consumption is 
set to triple by the end of this century, yet supplies of 
fossil fuels are rapidly being depleted. In addition, the 
consequences of their exploitation without adequate 
measures to reduce the production of gases that im-
pact on the environment are serious. In this context, 
a question looms over humanity today: How will we 
meet increasing energy demands while ensuring we 
do not add to atmospheric greenhouse gases?

New and improved low-carbon technologies, in par-
ticular renewables, are vital if Europe is to meet the 
energy objectives set for 2020 and 2050 in relation to 
combating climate change, security of energy supply 
and competitiveness.

Ethical considerations are integral to the formation of 
energy policy. This ethical analysis requires that the 
production systems being considered are compara-
ble: the analysis cannot only consider economic issues, 
but must consider the impact, positive or negative, that 
may occur during the entire life cycle of the system and 
this should encompass the impact on the environment 
and the implications of the use (or, indeed, cessation of 
use) of a particular energy source.

The following recommendations are based on the ethical 
framework proposed in this Opinion, by which actions 
and policies should be analysed with the express inten-
tion of delivering a sustainable future for Europe. The 
EGE has adopted an integrated ethics approach based 
on the cross-cutting principle of justice and the balance 
of subsidiarity and solidarity. Furthermore, the rationale 
for the following recommendations is to achieve the best 
possible equilibrium between the four criteria of analysis 
(access right, security, safety, and sustainability), in light 
of social, environmental and economic concerns.

4.1  Access to energy

Access to energy is an essential condition for human 
flourishing. A basic level of energy supply is, there -
fore, morally imperative. Article 36 of the Charter of 

Fundamental Rights of the European Union (136) advo-
cates that EU citizens have a right to access to ‘services 
of general economic interest’ although energy is not 
explicitly specified as one of these services. The Charter 
also requires that everyone has the opportunity to con-
tribute to shaping European Society, which, of course, 
includes use of energy services. The protection of the 
principle of equality in this respect is relevant in several 
domains of an individual’s life, such as home, health, 
work and education.

The EGE welcomes actions taken by the European 
Commission in the energy sector and invites the EU to 
actively participate and promote access to energy ser-
vices in European societies. The EGE recommends that:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

the EU secures and promotes the right of access to 
sufficient energy services to European citizens and 
this right to be included in the next revision of the 
Treaty or the Charter;

in accordance with the Millennium Development 
Goals, the EU should collaborate to ensure access 
to energy within a global perspective.

The EGE acknowledges that energy poverty still exists 
in Europe, particularly at a time of rising fuel prices and 
decreasing household spending power.

The EGE recommends that:

(cid:116)(cid:1) both quantitative and qualitative data on energy 
poverty should be collated and analysed across 
Member States by the Commission; on the basis of 
these data, the Commission should then prepare, 
adopt and implement an action plan to tackle en-
ergy poverty in the interests of solidarity and the 
health and well-being of European citizens.

4.2  Safety and impact assessment

Energy mix implies the production and use of differ-
ent types of energy sources that all have inherent risks 
and limitations which must be considered during their 
entire life cycle. Safety considerations are, therefore, 
central elements for a responsible use, and policy 

(136)  Article 36: The Union recognises and respects access to 
services of general economic interest as provided for in 
national laws and practices, in accordance with the Treaty 
establishing the European Community, in order to promote 
the social and territorial cohesion of the Union.

63

4 | RECOMMENDATIONS

design, of energy. Proper impact assessment meth-
odologies to compare the security and safety of the 
energy mix instruments are necessary. Risk and im-
pact assessments and stress tests of energy sources 
should use the best available data, be analysed by 
independent experts, be based on transparency, and 
cover the entire cycle of the energy scrutinised (pro-
duction, transport, storage, residues, dismantling and 
permanent disposal of waste material, etc.) as well as 
collateral effects such as competition for land with 
food production.

Integrative approaches, seeking a balance of social, 
environmental and economic concerns, need to be 
established to properly reflect the multilayer complex-
ity of the energy mix in the European Union. The EGE 
recommends the following.

(cid:116)(cid:1) Data regarding any kind of elements that affect risk 
in the production and transport of energy, health 
and environmental consequences of its use, and 
the total costs of any kind of energy production, 
should be available in a well-informed and trans-
parent way so that society informs itself in order to 
take decisions. The above should include (as exam-
ples): the energy balances (including energy spent 
in construction, transport, dismantling and perma-
nent disposal of waste material); social, environ-
mental and the economic impacts of the different 
energy sources such as biofuels (competition with 
food production and water availability), windmills 
(environmental impact), hydroelectric (flooding of 
soils and villages), photovoltaic (costs during the 
whole cycle, including the use of rare metals), nu-
clear (safety and long-term residues), fracking (gas 
emissions, water pollution, geological disruption), 
coal (air and water pollution, impact on commu-
nities if mining is abandoned), etc., including the 
contribution to climatic changes.

(cid:116)(cid:1)

Impact assessments of any energy source through-
out its whole life cycle should be carried out on 
a  comparative  basis  including  the  question  of 
accountability.

(cid:116)(cid:1) A  comparative  integrated  impact  assessment 
should be required for all energy sources, particu-
larly new technologies. Such an assessment should 
also involve the participation of local communities 
at the earliest possible opportunity and assess im-
pact and risks across the entire life cycle of the en-
ergy production, storage and use, in line with the 
Lisbon Treaty and the precautionary principle.

The group is aware that shale gas and shale oil are 
considered in the political debate to be a promising 
energy source for EU energy security and autonomy, 
and that decisions on whether to use this technology 
are complex and linked to multiple factors, including 
environmental protection, macroeconomic and geo-
political considerations. The Group, however, states 
that the European Union should commission studies to: 
(i) obtain additional data on the environmental and so-
cial impact of fracking; (ii) show the impact of shale gas 
on the transition to renewables; (iii) provide possibili-
ties as to how to implement appropriate institutional 
oversight. The Group, therefore, agrees that, from an 
ethical viewpoint, if safety and environment issues re-
main following these studies, fracking should not be 
pursued within the EU unless these conditions are met.

4.3  Security of energy supply

Security of supply of energy is one of the main tar-
gets of domestic and European Union policies. Since 
the European Union is highly dependent on energy 
imports, energy supply is vulnerable. The energy mix, 
which is a national competence in the EU, is a very com-
plex issue since national decisions affect European Un-
ion Member States and the European Union as a whole. 
It has been argued that these decisions are uncoordi-
nated and may contradict EU energy targets. The EGE 
therefore recommends that the European Union:

(cid:116)(cid:1) decreases its vulnerability to imported energy sources 
in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner;

(cid:116)(cid:1) ensures a coordinated policy in the field of energy 
supply as well as energy mix in order to achieve 
European  Union  security  of  supply  targets  at 
national and European level;

(cid:116)(cid:1) develops a European energy smart grid to secure 
and optimise energy supply by consolidating coop-
eration among European Union Member States in 
the spirit of solidarity and by developing decentral-
ised systems to support the energy supply; further-
more, decentralised systems such as microgenera-
tion of energy should be sustained when possible.

4.4  Sustainability

The current sources of energy rely mainly on energy 
stored in fossil reserves, such as oil, petrol and gas, which 
are, by definition, limited. Other energy sources, such as 
nuclear fission, are also dependent on limited raw mate-
rials. Energy systems based on the above materials are

becoming less sustainable and alternative renewable en-
ergy tools have acquired a central role in the European 
and global debate on energy. Economy of energy is a cen-
tral guiding principle in energy production and distribu-
tion and, for this reason, any action that improves effi-
ciency and reduces energy waste should be implemented.

The conversion of energy stored in fossil fuels has 
determined significant climate consequences and in-
duced the EU to adopt decarbonised energy policies 
for the future.

Current and future access to energy that is problem-
atic due either to reduction of reserves or because of 
present environmental impact, which is a key factor in 
climate change, are issues that oblige decision-makers 
to confront the issues pertaining to intergenerational 
justice and responsibility.

The EU has already made choices in its energy and en-
vironmental policies to transition from non-renewable 
energy sources to renewables. However, this goal can 
only be achieved if the energy mix that is currently sup-
ported is regularly assessed in light of this overall goal. 
Given the current data on climate changes, the EGE rec-
ommends that the EU closely coordinates its policies 
with international environmental and economic exper-
tise regarding the question of how quick the transition 
is possible and at what point the non-renewable and 
renewable energy mix becomes counterproductive. In 
the assessment, the comparative method proposed by 
the EGE should be elaborated and applied in a trans-
parent way. The EGE recommends that the European 
Union implements policies to:

1.  reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases 
producing greenhouse effects in the production of 
energy, as stated in the Energy Roadmap 2050;

2.  favour the development and use of low-carbon 
technologies with special attention to renewables, 
for example by fiscal and other relevant measures;

3.  make every effort to improve energy efficiency and 
to reduce energy waste; particular attention should 
be paid to the following implementing measures to 
achieve this goal:

(a)  the establishment of smart grids;

(b)  encouraging incentives and establishing nor-
mative requirements to reduce and distribute 
energy  production  and  uses  in  the  field  of 

transport, construction, heating, etc. (non-es-
sential energy uses, incentives to build energy-
efficient urban renovation);

(c)  promoting actions to promote availability of 
renewable technologies to vulnerable groups 
of society;

4.  enhance the awareness of citizens (starting from 
an early age) regarding the need to adopt new 
attitudes and lifestyles for the responsible use of 
energy by promoting and financing educational 
projects and awareness-raising initiatives (e.g. pro-
moting sustainability in schools);

5.  evaluate the different Member States’ strategies on 
a regular basis, particularly in light of the policies 
to use ‘conventional’, low-carbon and ‘renewable’ 
energy sources.

4.5  Research

Research on energy is crucial if the European Union 
goals and targets stated in the Energy Roadmap 2050 
are to be achieved. Research priorities need to be 
consistent with these goals and targets and should in-
clude the integrated ethics approach that the EGE has 
adopted in this Opinion. The EGE stresses the need for 
Europe to invest in research on low-carbon technolo-
gies, in particular renewable energy. For these reasons, 
the EGE recommends that priorities for research should 
be identified and should include:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

research on technologies that would contribute 
to the development of European smart grid in-
frastructure that is configured so as to have suffi-
cient capability to harness the potential benefits 
of low-carbon and renewable technologies, in 
particular when decentralised energy production 
is developed;

research on new technologies for the storage of 
energy where and when an excess is produced 
in order to facilitate the use of energies that are 
intermittent;

interdisciplinary research on the storage and trans-
port of materials and the residues related to energy 
production and use;

analyses of the residues from different energy 
sources, their reduction or elimination and possible 
reuse — research to determine the most suitable 

65

The EGE recommends that the European Union should 
set incentives to implement participatory approaches, 
for example in the following areas:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

civil society ‘hearings’;

local and regional energy cooperatives;

local initiatives to save energy;

local and regional initiatives for low-carbon urban 
development and community design.

Both spatial and temporal dimensions of the conse-
quences of human activity play a crucial role in the 
ethics of energy. Consequently, the present genera-
tion faces the ethical challenge to broaden its moral 
perspective by taking seriously into account the long-
term effects of its decisions and actions on posterity. 
This challenge is based on the demands of social justice 
that appeal to the principle that a community has the 
moral duty to give particular help to those who are dis-
advantaged out of human solidarity.

Therefore, the EGE recommends that:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

the European Union and its institutions should set 
up an ‘ombudsperson’ structure to protect the inter-
ests of future generations; the function of this office 
would not be to decide, but to promote enlightened 
decisions by bringing into discussions the long-term 
effects of all political, socioeconomic and techno-
logical decisions.

4 | RECOMMENDATIONS

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

technologies, regulations and infrastructures for 
future carbon capture, storage and sequestration;

research on energy efficiency in all areas, but partic-
ularly in urban design and architecture, transport, 
utilities and industrial facilities;

research funding being allocated to ongoing work 
in the area of psychosocial modelling of individual 
and community behavioural interventions in the 
area of energy conservation in order to support 
energy-efficiency initiatives in setting new stand-
ards beyond current best practice.

A balance between research on different sources of en-
ergy has to be decided and the reasons for that need 
to be spelled out (and made public):

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

comparative studies on the implementation of the 
Energy Roadmap 2050 in European Union Member 
States (quantitative and qualitative data), with spe-
cific emphasis on sociocultural and geographical 
factors that have justified the adoption of specific 
energy mix systems at local level;

comparative impact assessments of all energy 
sources,  using  the  integrated  methodology  of 
technological, social, and political scenarios — 
this should include scenarios of worst case (social, 
environmental), short and long-term prognoses, 
geopolitical contexts and safety risks for workers;

(cid:116)(cid:1)

social sciences (individual responsibilities), psych-
ology, social anthropology, sociology, ethics and law.

The EGE is of the view that, as argued in previous Opin-
ions, the development of science and technology re-
quires critical and independent ethical analysis which 
can be facilitated by supporting a community of ex-
perts. In order to help this process, the Group therefore 
recommends that interdisciplinary research on the ethi-
cal, legal and social implication (thematic programme) 
of energy to be financed under Horizon 2020.

4.6  Democratic deliberation, participatory 

instruments and responsibility for future 
generations

Democratic deliberation is essential in making choices 
on how citizens respond to the challenges of energy 
production and uses. Several instruments have been 
explored in the last decades to strengthen participa-
tory mechanisms.

4.  Recommandations

Les combustibles fossiles ont été la source d’énergie 
qui a façonné la vie des XIXe et XXe siècle. Alors que 
la consommation mondiale d’énergie devrait tripler 
d’ici à la fin du siècle, les réserves de combustibles 
fossiles diminuent rapidement. En outre, les consé-
quences de leur exploitation sont considérables sans 
les nécessaires mesures adéquates destinées à réduire 
la production de gaz nocifs pour l’environnement. Dans 
ce contexte, deux questions planent aujourd’hui au-
dessus de l’humanité: comment répondre à l’augmen-
tation de la demande d’énergie sans augmenter nos 
rejets de gaz à effet de serre dans l’atmosphère?

Les technologies à faible intensité de carbone, qu’il 
s’agisse de nouvelles technologies ou de technologies 
améliorées, notamment les énergies renouvelables, 
sont essentielles pour que l’Europe puisse atteindre les 
objectifs énergétiques qu’elle s’est fixés pour 2020 et 
2050 en ce qui concerne la lutte contre le changement 
climatique, la sécurité d’approvisionnement en énergie 
et la compétitivité.

Les considérations éthiques font partie intégrante de la 
définition de la politique dans ce domaine. Cette ana-
lyse éthique requiert que les systèmes de production 
examinés soient comparables. L’analyse ne peut porter 
uniquement sur les questions économiques, mais doit 
tenir compte des incidences, positives ou négatives, 
qui peuvent se produire sur l’ensemble du cycle de vie 
du système, dont l’incidence sur l’environnement et 
les implications de l’utilisation (voire de l’abandon de 
l’utilisation) d’une source d’énergie donnée.

Les recommandations qui suivent se fondent sur le 
cadre éthique proposé dans le présent avis, à l’aune 
duquel les actions et politiques devraient être analy-
sées dans le but exprès de garantir un avenir durable 
pour l’Europe. Le GEE a adopté une approche éthique 
intégrée, fondée sur le principe transversal de justice 
et sur l’équilibre entre subsidiarité et solidarité. En 
outre, la raison d’être des recommandations suivantes 
est de trouver le meilleur équilibre possible entre les 
quatre critères d’analyse (droit d’accès, sécurité, sûreté 
et durabilité), à la lumière des préoccupations sociales, 
environnementales et économiques.

4.1  Accès à l’énergie

L’accès à l’énergie est une condition essentielle de la 
prospérité humaine. Un niveau minimal d’approvision-
nement en énergie est donc moralement impératif. 

L’article 36 de la charte des droits fondamentaux de 
l’Union européenne (74) défend un droit d’accès pour 
les citoyens de l’Union européenne aux «services d’in-
térêt économique général». L’énergie n’est pas expli-
citement mentionnée parmi ces services. Néanmoins, 
la charte exige également que chacun ait la possibilité 
de contribuer à façonner la société européenne, ce qui 
comprend évidemment l’utilisation de services énergé-
tiques. À cet égard, la protection du principe d’égalité 
de traitement est utile dans plusieurs domaines de la 
vie d’une personne, tels que la vie domestique, la santé, 
le travail et l’éducation.

Le Groupe européen d’éthique des sciences et des 
nouvelles technologies (GEE) se félicite de l’action de 
la Commission européenne dans le secteur de l’énergie 
et invite l’Union à participer activement à la promotion 
de l’accès aux services énergétiques dans les sociétés 
européennes. Le GEE recommande:

(cid:116)(cid:1) que l’Union garantisse et promeuve le droit d’accès 
des citoyens européens à des services énergétiques 
suffisants et que ce droit soit inclus dans la pro-
chaine révision du traité ou de la charte des droits 
fondamentaux;

(cid:116)(cid:1) que, conformément aux objectifs du millénaire 
pour le développement, l’Union collabore avec ses 
partenaires en vue d’assurer l’accès à l’énergie dans 
une perspective mondiale.

Le GEE reconnaît que la pauvreté énergétique existe 
toujours en Europe, en particulier en cette période 
de hausse des prix du pétrole et de baisse du pouvoir 
d’achat des ménages.

Le GEE recommande:

(cid:116)(cid:1) que des données tant quantitatives que qualitatives 
sur la pauvreté énergétique soient rassemblées et 
analysées dans les États membres par la Commis-
sion. Sur la base de ces données, la Commission de-
vrait alors élaborer, adopter et mettre en œuvre un 
plan d’action pour lutter contre la pauvreté éner-
gétique dans un souci de solidarité et au bénéfice 
de la santé et du bien-être des citoyens européens.

(74)  «L’Union reconnaît et respecte l’accès aux services d’intérêt 
économique général tel qu’il est prévu par les législations 
et pratiques nationales, conformément au traité instituant la 
Communauté européenne, aﬁn de promouvoir la cohésion 
sociale et territoriale de l’Union.»

4.2  Sécurité et analyse d’impact

Le bouquet énergétique implique la production et 
l’utilisation de différents types de sources d’énergie 
qui présentent toutes des risques et contraintes intrin-
sèques dont il convient de tenir compte sur l’ensemble 
du cycle de vie. Les considérations liées à la sécurité 
sont donc des éléments déterminants pour une uti-
lisation responsable de l’énergie et la définition des 
politiques en la matière. Des méthodes appropriées 
d’analyse d’impact permettant de comparer la sécurité 
et la sûreté des instruments du bouquet énergétique 
sont nécessaires. L’évaluation des risques et des inci-
dences ainsi que les tests de résistance portant sur les 
sources d’énergie doivent reposer sur les meilleures 
données disponibles, analysées par des experts indé-
pendants et conformes au principe de transparence, 
et couvrir l’ensemble du cycle de vie de la source 
d’énergie considérée (production, transport, stockage, 
résidus, démantèlement et évacuation définitive des 
déchets, etc.) ainsi que les effets collatéraux tels que la 
concurrence avec les terres destinées à la production 
alimentaire.

Des approches intégratives, visant un équilibre entre 
les considérations sociales, environnementales et éco-
nomiques, doivent être établies afin d’appréhender 
au mieux la complexité multifactorielle associée au 
bouquet énergétique de l’Union européenne. Le GEE 
recommande:

(cid:116)(cid:1) que des données concernant tout type d’élément 
ayant une incidence sur les risques dans la produc-
tion et le transport de l’énergie, les conséquences 
de son utilisation en matière de santé et d’environ-
nement ainsi que les coûts totaux de tout type de 
production d’énergie soient disponibles sous une 
forme probante et transparente, de sorte que la 
société soit informée en vue de prendre des déci-
sions. Ce qui précède inclut, à titre d’exemple: les 
bilans énergétiques (y compris l’énergie dépensée 
dans la construction, le transport, le démantèle-
ment et l’évacuation définitive des déchets), les 
incidences sociales, environnementales et éco-
nomiques des différentes sources d’énergie telles 
que les biocarburants (concurrence avec la pro-
duction de denrées alimentaires et disponibilité 
de l’eau), les éoliennes (incidences sur l’environ-
nement), l’hydroélectricité (inondations des sols 
et des villages), l’énergie photovoltaïque (coûts 
sur toute la durée du cycle de vie, y compris l’uti-
lisation de métaux rares), le nucléaire (sûreté et 
déchets à long terme), la fracturation (émissions 

de gaz, pollution de l’eau, rupture de la structure 
géologique), le charbon (pollution de l’air et de 
l’eau, impact sur les collectivités lorsque l’extrac-
tion minière est abandonnée), etc. La contribution 
au changement climatique doit également être 
prise en compte;

(cid:116)(cid:1) qu’une analyse d’impact de l’ensemble des sources 
d’énergie tout au long de leur cycle de vie soit ef-
fectuée sur une base comparative et tienne compte 
de la question de la responsabilité;

(cid:116)(cid:1) qu’une analyse d’impact intégrée comparative 
soit requise pour toutes les sources d’énergie, en 
particulier pour les nouvelles technologies. Cette 
analyse devrait également prévoir la participation 
des collectivités locales au stade le plus précoce 
possible et évaluer les incidences et les risques 
sur l’ensemble du cycle de vie de la production, 
du stockage et de l’utilisation de l’énergie, en 
accord avec le traité de Lisbonne et le principe de 
précaution.

Le Groupe est conscient que le gaz de schiste et le 
schiste bitumineux sont considérés, dans le débat 
politique, comme une source d’énergie prometteuse 
pour la sécurité et l’autonomie énergétiques de l’Union 
et que les décisions sur l’opportunité d’utiliser cette 
technologie sont complexes et liées à de multiples 
facteurs, dont la protection de l’environnement et des 
considérations macroéconomiques et géopolitiques. 
Le Groupe déclare toutefois que l’Union européenne 
devrait faire réaliser des études pour 1) obtenir des don-
nées complémentaires sur les effets environnementaux 
et sociaux de la fracturation, 2) montrer l’incidence 
du gaz de schiste sur la transition vers les énergies 
renouvelables et 3) fournir des possibilités quant à la 
manière de mettre en œuvre un contrôle institution-
nel approprié. Le Groupe s’accorde donc à reconnaître, 
d’un point de vue éthique, que si les problèmes liés à la 
sécurité et à l’environnement persistent à la suite de ces 
études, la fracturation ne devrait pas se poursuivre au 
sein de l’Union, à moins que ces conditions ne soient 
remplies.

4.3  Sécurité d’approvisionnement 

en énergie

La sécurité d’approvisionnement en énergie est l’un 
des principaux objectifs des politiques nationales et 
de l’Union européenne. Dans la mesure où l’Union 
est fortement tributaire des importations d’énergie, 
son approvisionnement énergétique est vulnérable.

RECOMMANDATIONS | 4

Le bouquet énergétique, qui relève de la compétence 
nationale dans l’Union européenne, est une question 
très complexe étant donné que les décisions nationales 
affectent les États membres de l’Union européenne et 
l’Union dans son ensemble. D’aucuns font valoir que 
ces décisions ne sont pas coordonnées et qu’elles 
peuvent être en contradiction avec les objectifs de 
l’Union en matière d’énergie. Le GEE recommande dès 
lors que l’Union européenne:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

réduise de manière durable et écologiquement 
rationnelle sa vulnérabilité à l’égard des sources 
d’énergie importées;

assure  une  politique  coordonnée  en  matière 
d’approvisionnement énergétique et de bouquet 
énergétique afin d’atteindre les objectifs de l’Union 
européenne relatifs à la sécurité d’approvisionne-
ment aux niveaux national et européen;

(cid:116)(cid:1) développe des réseaux énergétiques intelligents 
pour sécuriser et optimiser l’approvisionnement 
énergétique, en renforçant la coopération entre 
les États membres de l’Union européenne dans 
un esprit de solidarité et en mettant en place des 
systèmes décentralisés à l’appui de l’approvision-
nement énergétique. Plus encore, les systèmes dé-
centralisés, tels que la microproduction d’énergie, 
devraient être soutenus lorsque cela est possible.

4.4  Durabilité

Les sources actuelles d’énergie reposent principalement 
sur l’énergie stockée dans les réserves fossiles, comme 
le pétrole, l’essence et le gaz, qui sont, par définition, 
limitées. D’autres sources d’énergie, telles que la fission 
nucléaire, dépendent également de matières premières 
limitées. Les systèmes énergétiques tributaires des ma-
tières premières précitées deviennent moins durables 
et d’autres sources d’énergie renouvelables ont acquis 
une place centrale dans le débat qui se tient à l’échelle 
mondiale et européenne dans le domaine de l’énergie. 
Les économies d’énergie constituent un principe direc-
teur clé dans la production et la distribution d’énergie, 
raison pour laquelle toute mesure qui permet d’amé-
liorer l’efficacité énergétique et de réduire le gaspillage 
d’énergie devrait être mise en œuvre.

La conversion de l’énergie stockée dans les combus-
tibles fossiles a eu des conséquences considérables sur 
le climat, ce qui a amené l’Union européenne à adopter 
des politiques visant à instaurer un système énergé-
tique sans carbone.

L’accès présent et futur à  l’énergie, qui est probléma-
tique en raison soit d’une réduction des réserves soit des 
répercussions actuelles sur l’environnement, qui sont un 
facteur clé du changement climatique, est une question 
qui contraint les décideurs à se pencher sur les questions 
de justice et de responsabilité intergénérationnelles.

Dans ses politiques énergétique et environnementale, 
l’Union a déjà posé certains choix en faveur d’une tran-
sition des sources d’énergie non renouvelables vers les 
sources d’énergie renouvelables. Toutefois, cet objectif 
ne peut être atteint que si le bouquet énergétique qui 
est actuellement défendu est régulièrement évalué 
à la lumière de cet objectif général. Compte tenu des 
données actuelles sur le changement climatique, le GEE 
recommande que l’Union coordonne étroitement ses 
politiques avec la réflexion internationale en matière 
économique et environnementale en ce qui concerne 
la question de savoir à quelle vitesse cette transition 
peut s’opérer et à partir de quand la combinaison des 
sources d’énergie renouvelables et non renouvelables 
devient contre-productive. Lors de cette évaluation, la 
méthode comparative proposée par le GEE devrait être 
précisée et appliquée d’une manière transparente. Le 
GEE recommande que l’Union européenne mette en 
œuvre des politiques visant à:

1)  réduire les émissions de dioxyde de carbone et 
d’autres gaz à effet de serre lors de la production 
d’énergie, comme indiqué dans la feuille de route 
européenne pour l’énergie à l’horizon 2050;

2)  favoriser la mise au point et l’utilisation de techno-
logies à faible intensité de carbone, en accordant 
une attention particulière aux sources d’énergie 
renouvelables, par exemple au moyen de mesures 
fiscales et d’autres mesures appropriées;

3)  assurer par tous les moyens l’amélioration de l’effi-
cacité énergétique et la réduction du gaspillage 
d’énergie. Pour atteindre cet objectif, une atten-
tion particulière devrait être accordée aux mesures 
suivantes:

a)  mise en place de réseaux intelligents,

b)  mesures d’incitation et exigences normatives 
afin de réduire et de répartir la production et 
l’utilisation d’énergie dans les domaines des 
transports, de la construction, du chauffage, 
etc. (utilisations énergétiques non essentielles, 
incitations à intégrer l’efficacité énergétique 
dans la rénovation urbaine),

71

4 | RECOMMANDATIONS

c)  actions visant à promouvoir la disponibilité des 
technologies renouvelables pour les groupes 
vulnérables de la société;

4)  sensibiliser les citoyens (dès le plus jeune âge) 
à  l’adoption  de  nouveaux  comportements  et 
modes de vie propices à une utilisation responsable 
de l’énergie, par la promotion et le financement de 
projets pédagogiques et d’actions de sensibilisa-
tion (par exemple la promotion de la durabilité 
dans les écoles);

5)  évaluer régulièrement les différentes stratégies des 
États membres, notamment au regard des poli-
tiques concernant l’utilisation des sources d’énergie 
«conventionnelles», «à faible intensité de carbone» 
et «renouvelables».

4.5  Recherche

La recherche dans le domaine de l’énergie est essen-
tielle si l’on veut atteindre les objectifs et cibles de 
l’Union européenne fixés dans la feuille de route 
pour 2050. Les priorités de recherche doivent être 
cohérentes avec ces derniers et devraient inclure 
l’approche intégrée en matière d’éthique que le GEE 
a adoptée dans le présent avis. Le GEE souligne la 
nécessité pour l’Europe d’investir dans la recherche 
sur les technologies à faible intensité de carbone, 
en particulier les énergies renouvelables. Pour ces 
raisons, le GEE recommande que des priorités de 
recherche soient définies et qu’elles englobent les 
éléments suivants:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

les technologies susceptibles de contribuer au dé-
veloppement d’une infrastructure européenne de 
réseaux intelligents configurée de manière à offrir 
suffisamment de capacité pour exploiter les avan-
tages potentiels des technologies à faible intensité 
de carbone et des technologies liées aux sources 
renouvelables, en particulier lorsque la production 
décentralisée d’énergie se développera;

les nouvelles technologies de stockage de l’énergie 
lorsque la production est excédentaire, afin de faci-
liter l’utilisation des énergies intermittentes;

les travaux de recherche interdisciplinaires sur le 
stockage et le transport des matières et résidus liés 
à l’utilisation et à la production d’énergie;

l’analyse  de  la  production  de  résidus  liée  aux 
différentes  sources  d’énergie,  la  réduction  ou 

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

l’élimination de ces résidus et leur éventuelle réu-
tilisation; la recherche en vue de déterminer les 
technologies, réglementations et infrastructures 
futures les plus appropriées pour le piégeage et le 
stockage du carbone;

l’efficacité énergétique dans tous les domaines, 
mais particulièrement l’urbanisme et l’architecture, 
les transports, les services d’utilité publique et les 
installations industrielles;

le financement qui devrait être consacré aux tra-
vaux de recherche en cours dans le domaine de 
la modélisation psychosociale des actions visant 
à modifier les comportements individuels et collec-
tifs influençant la conservation de l’énergie, afin de 
soutenir des initiatives en matière d’efficacité éner-
gétique de nature à relever les normes au-delà des 
meilleures pratiques actuelles.

Un  équilibre  entre  la  recherche  sur  les  différentes 
sources d’énergie doit être trouvé et les décisions corres-
pondantes doivent être motivées (et rendues publiques):

(cid:116)(cid:1) des études comparatives concernant la mise en 
œuvre de la feuille de route européenne sur l’éner-
gie à l’horizon 2050 dans les États membres de 
l’Union (données quantitatives et qualitatives), 
avec une attention particulière pour les facteurs 
socioculturels et géographiques qui ont justifié 
l’adoption de bouquets énergétiques spécifiques 
au niveau local;

(cid:116)(cid:1) une analyse d’impact comparative de toutes les 
sources d’énergie, sur la base de la méthode inté-
grée des scénarios technologiques, sociaux et poli-
tiques. Il s’agit notamment d’envisager le scénario 
du cas le plus défavorable (social et environnemen-
tal), les prévisions à court terme et à long terme, les 
contextes géopolitiques et les risques de sécurité 
pour les travailleurs;

(cid:116)(cid:1)

les sciences sociales (responsabilités individuelles), 
la psychologie, l’anthropologie sociale, la sociolo-
gie, l’éthique et le droit.

Le GEE estime, comme il l’a fait valoir dans des avis pré-
cédents, que le développement des sciences et de la 
technologie requiert une analyse éthique critique et 
indépendante, qui peut requérir le soutien d’un groupe 
d’experts. Afin de faciliter ce processus, le Groupe 
recommande par conséquent que la recherche inter-
disciplinaire sur les implications éthiques, juridiques

financée dans le cadre du programme «Horizon 2020».

4.6  Délibération démocratique, procédures 
de participation et responsabilité 
envers les générations futures

La délibération démocratique est indispensable si 
l’on veut effectuer des choix sur la manière dont les 
citoyens répondent aux défis de la production et de 
l’utilisation de l’énergie. Plusieurs outils ont été explo-
rés au cours des dernières décennies pour renforcer les 
mécanismes participatifs.

Le GEE recommande que l’Union européenne adopte 
des mesures d’incitation visant à mettre en œuvre 
des approches participatives, par exemple dans les 
domaines suivants:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

«auditions» de la société civile;

coopératives locales et régionales dans le domaine 
de l’énergie;

initiatives locales visant à économiser l’énergie;

initiatives locales et régionales concernant un déve-
loppement urbain et des aménagements collectifs 
à faible intensité de carbone.

La dimension spatiale comme la dimension temporelle 
des effets de l’activité humaine jouent un rôle crucial 
dans l’éthique de l’énergie. Par conséquent, la géné-
ration actuelle est confrontée au défi éthique d’élar-
gir sa perspective morale en prenant sérieusement 
en compte les effets à long terme de ses décisions et 
actions sur la postérité. Ce défi découle des exigences 
de justice sociale, selon le principe qu’une communau-
té a le devoir moral d’accorder une aide particulière 
à ceux qui sont défavorisés, par solidarité humaine. 

Le GEE recommande par conséquent:

(cid:116)(cid:1) que l’Union européenne et ses institutions mettent 
en place une structure de médiation («ombudsper-
son»), pour protéger les intérêts des générations 
futures. Sa fonction ne serait pas de prendre des 
décisions, mais de promouvoir des décisions éclai-
rées en intégrant dans les discussions les effets 
à long terme de toutes les décisions politiques, 
socio-économiques et technologiques.

4.  Empfehlungen

4.1  Zugang zu Energie

Fossile Brennstoffe waren die Energiequelle, die das 
Leben im 19. und im 20. Jahrhundert geprägt hat. Der 
weltweite Energieverbrauch soll sich bis Ende dieses 
Jahrhunderts verdreifachen; die Vorräte an fossilen 
Brennstoffen werden aber schon bald erschöpft sein. 
Hinzu kommt, dass deren Ausbeutung ohne ange-
messene Maßnahmen zur Reduzierung des Ausstoßes 
umweltschädigender Gase gravierende Konsequenzen 
hat. Vor diesem Hintergrund stellen sich heute zwei 
große Fragen für die Menschheit: Wie können wir die 
steigende Energienachfrage decken und gleichzeitig 
sicherstellen, dass wir nicht noch mehr Treibhausgase 
produzieren?

Neue und verbesserte Technologien mit geringem CO2-
Ausstoß, insbesondere erneuerbare Energien, sind von 
fundamentaler Bedeutung, wenn Europa die für 2020 
und 2050 mit Blick auf Klimaschutz, Energieversor-
gungssicherheit und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit anvisierten 
energiepolitischen Ziele erreichen will.

Ethische Erwägungen sind integraler Bestandteil bei 
der Formulierung energiepolitischer Konzepte. Eine 
Analyse unter ethischen Gesichtspunkten setzt voraus, 
dass die betrachteten Produktionssysteme vergleich-
bar sind. Die Analyse darf sich nicht auf wirtschaftliche 
Aspekte beschränken, sondern muss die – positiven 
und negativen – Auswirkungen berücksichtigen, zu 
denen es während der gesamten Lebensdauer eines 
Systems kommen kann; dazu zählen sowohl die Um-
weltauswirkungen als auch die Konsequenzen der Nut-
zung (oder des Ausstiegs aus der Nutzung) bestimmter 
Energiequellen.

Die nachstehenden Empfehlungen basieren auf dem 
in dieser Stellungnahme vorgeschlagenen ethischen 
Rahmen, dem zufolge Maßnahmen und politische Stra-
tegien mit der ausdrücklichen Absicht analysiert wer-
den sollten, eine tragfähige Zukunft für Europa zu si-
chern. Die EGE hat sich für einen integrativen ethischen 
Ansatz entschieden, der auf dem Querschnittsprinzip 
der Gerechtigkeit und einem ausgewogenen Verhältnis 
zwischen Subsidiarität und Solidarität basiert. Darüber 
hinaus zielen die nachstehenden Empfehlungen darauf 
ab, unter Berücksichtigung sozialer, ökologischer und 
wirtschaftlicher Anliegen ein bestmögliches Gleich-
gewicht zwischen den vier zugrunde gelegten Analy-
sekriterien (Recht auf Zugang, Versorgungssicherheit, 
Sicherheit und Nachhaltigkeit) zu gewährleisten.

Der Zugang zu Energie ist eine wesentliche Voraus-
setzung für das Wohlergehen der Menschheit. Eine 
Energiegrundversorgung ist somit ein Gebot der Mo-
ral. In Artikel 36 der Charta der Grundrechte der Euro-
päischen Union (74) ist das Recht der EU-Bürgerinnen 
und -Bürger auf Zugang zu „Dienstleistungen von all-
gemeinem wirtschaftlichen Interesse“ verankert. Ener-
giedienstleistungen werden dabei nicht explizit auf-
geführt. Die Europäische Grundrechtecharta verlangt 
zudem, dass jeder Mensch die Möglichkeit hat, an der 
Gestaltung der europäischen Gesellschaft mitzuwirken, 
was selbstverständlich auch die Inanspruchnahme von 
Energiedienstleistungen einschließt. Hier ist die Wah-
rung des Gleichheitsgrundsatzes in verschiedenen Le-
bensbereichen des Einzelnen von Bedeutung – ob es 
um Wohnung, Gesundheit, Arbeit oder Bildung geht.

Die EGE begrüßt die von der Europäischen Kommission 
im Energiesektor getroffenen Maßnahmen und fordert 
die EU auf, einen aktiven Beitrag zu leisten, um den 
Zugang zu Energie in den europäischen Gesellschaften 
zu verbessern. Die EGE empfiehlt,

(cid:116)(cid:1) dass die EU das Recht der europäischen Bürge-
rinnen und Bürger auf Zugang zu ausreichenden 
Energiedienstleistungen gewährleistet und fördert 
und dass dieses Recht bei der nächsten Überarbei-
tung des Vertrags dortselbst oder in die Grund-
rechtecharta Eingang findet;

(cid:116)(cid:1) dass die EU – im Einklang mit den Millenniumszie-
len – daran mitwirkt, den Zugang zu Energie in ei-
ner globalen Perspektive sicherzustellen.

Die EGE stellt fest, dass es in Europa nach wie vor Ener-
giearmut gibt, gerade in Zeiten steigender Kraftstoff-
preise und einer abnehmenden Kaufkraft der privaten 
Haushalte.

Die EGE empfiehlt,

(cid:116)(cid:1) dass die Kommission für alle Mitgliedstaaten quan-
titative und qualitative Daten über Energiearmut 
zusammenträgt und analysiert und anschließend 

(74)  Artikel 36: „Die Union anerkennt und achtet den Zugang zu 
Dienstleistungen von allgemeinem wirtschaftlichen Inter-
esse, wie er durch die einzelstaatlichen Rechtsvorschriften 
und Gepﬂogenheiten im Einklang mit den Verträgen ge-
regelt ist, um den sozialen und territorialen Zusammenhalt 
der Union zu fördern.“

auf der Grundlage dieser Daten einen Aktionsplan 
zur Bekämpfung von Energiearmut – im Interesse 
der Solidarität und von Gesundheit und Wohlerge-
hen der europäischen Bürgerinnen und Bürger – 
ausarbeitet, beschließt und umsetzt.

4.2  Sicherheitsbewertung und 
Folgenabschätzung

Energiemix bedeutet, dass unterschiedliche Arten von 
Energie aus unterschiedlichen Quellen erzeugt und 
genutzt werden. Ihnen allen sind Risiken und Grenzen 
immanent,  welche  über  ihre  gesamte  Lebensdauer 
hinweg zu berücksichtigen sind. Mit Blick auf eine ver-
antwortungsvolle Energienutzung und eine verantwor-
tungsvolle Energiepolitik sind Sicherheitsüberlegungen 
somit unterlässlich. Erforderlich sind angemessene Fol-
genabschätzungsmethoden, die einen Vergleich der 
Energiemixinstrumente unter den Aspekten Sicherheit 
und Gefahrenabwehr ermöglichen. Risikobewertungen, 
Folgenabschätzungen und Stresstests für Energieträger 
sollten sich auf die besten verfügbaren – von unabhän-
gigen Experten analysierten und transparent erhobenen 
– Daten stützen und den gesamten Zyklus (Erzeugung, 
Transport, Lagerung, Rückstände, Unschädlichmachung 
und Entsorgung von Abfällen usw.) einschließlich etwai-
ger Nebeneffekte berücksichtigen, wie etwa die Konkur-
renz mit der Nahrungsmittelproduktion um Agrarflächen.

Es müssen Gesamtkonzepte entwickelt werden, die auf 
ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen sozialen, ökolo-
gischen und wirtschaftlichen Aspekten abstellen und 
der Vielschichtigkeit und Komplexität des Energiemixes 
in der Europäischen Union angemessen Rechnung tra-
gen. Die EGE empfiehlt,

(cid:116)(cid:1) dass Daten zu Faktoren, die die Risiken bei Erzeugung 
und Transport von Energie beeinflussen, zu den Fol-
gen von deren Nutzung für Gesundheit und Umwelt 
und zu den Gesamtkosten jeder Art der Energieer-
zeugung verfügbar gemacht werden, so dass eine 
ausreichende Information und Transparenz gewähr-
leistet ist und die Gesellschaft sich im Hinblick auf 
anstehende Entscheidungen selbst kundig machen 
kann; die einschlägigen Daten sollten (beispielsweise) 
Folgendes abdecken: die Energiebilanz (einschließ-
lich des Energieeinsatzes bei Bauarbeiten, Transport, 
Unschädlichmachung und Entsorgung von Abfällen) 
sowie die sozialen, ökologischen und wirtschaftli-
chen Auswirkungen der verschiedenen Energieträ-
ger wie Biokraftstoffe (Konkurrenz mit Nahrungsmit-
telerzeugung und Wasserverfügbarkeit), Windräder 
(Umweltauswirkungen), Wasserkraft (Flutungen von 

Böden und Dörfern), Fotovoltaik (Kosten während der 
gesamten Lebensdauer, einschließlich Verwendung 
seltener Metalle), Kernenergie (Sicherheit und Endla-
gerung), Fracking (Gasemissionen, Wasserverschmut-
zung, geologische Störungen), Kohle (Luft- und Was-
serverschmutzung, Folgen einer Einstellung von 
Bergbautätigkeiten für die betreffenden Kommunen) 
usw., und zwar unter Berücksichtigung des jeweiligen 
Anteils am Klimawandel;

(cid:116)(cid:1) dass für alle Energiequellen über ihre gesamte Le-
bensdauer hinweg vergleichende Folgenabschät-
zungen durchgeführt werden, wobei auch der As-
pekt der Haftung zu berücksichtigen ist;

(cid:116)(cid:1) dass eine vergleichende, integrative Folgenab-
schätzung für alle Energiequellen, insbesondere für 
neue Technologien, verlangt wird; im Rahmen einer 
solchen Bewertung sollten zum frühestmöglichen 
Zeitpunkt auch die Kommunen eingebunden und 
die Auswirkungen und Risiken bei Erzeugung, La-
gerung und Nutzung von Energie über den gesam-
ten Lebenszyklus hinweg – im Einklang mit dem 
Vertrag von Lissabon und dem Vorsorgeprinzip – 
beurteilt werden.

Die Gruppe ist sich dessen bewusst, dass Schiefergas 
und Schieferöl in der politischen Debatte mit Blick auf 
die Energieversorgungssicherheit und die Autonomie 
der EU als vielversprechende Energiequellen gesehen 
werden und dass Entscheidungen über die Nutzung 
dieser Technologie komplex sind und einer Vielzahl 
von Faktoren Rechnung tragen müssen, unter anderem 
ökologischen, makroökonomischen und geopolitischen 
Erwägungen. Die Gruppe weist jedoch darauf hin, dass 
die Europäische Union Studien in Auftrag geben sollte, 
um 1. zusätzliche Daten über die ökologischen und sozi-
alen Auswirkungen des Fracking verfügbar zu machen, 
2. die Auswirkungen der Schiefergasförderung auf den 
Übergang zu erneuerbaren Energien zu untersuchen 
und 3. Möglichkeiten aufzuzeigen, wie eine geeignete 
institutionelle Kontrolle gewährleistet werden kann. 
Deshalb gelangt die Gruppe übereinstimmend zu der 
Auffassung, dass, wenn diesen Studien zufolge weiterhin 
Sicherheits- und Umweltbelange ungeklärt bleiben, aus 
ethischen Gründen von der Fracking-Technologie in der 
EU Abstand genommen werden sollte, solange nicht die 
erforderlichen Voraussetzungen gegeben sind.

Europäischen Union. Da die Europäische Union in ho-
hem Maße von Energieimporten abhängig ist, ist die 
Energieversorgung anfällig. Die Festlegung des Ener-
giemixes, die in der EU in die nationale Zuständigkeit 
fällt, ist äußerst komplex, da nationale Entscheidungen 
auch die Mitgliedstaaten der Europäischen Union und 
die Europäische Union als Ganzes betreffen. Es werden 
Befürchtungen geäußert, dass solche Entscheidungen 
ohne jegliche Abstimmung getroffen werden und den 
energiepolitischen Zielen der EU zuwiderlaufen kön-
nen. Daher empfiehlt die EGE, dass die Europäische 
Union

(cid:116)(cid:1)

ihre aus der Abhängigkeit von importierten Ener-
gieträgern resultierende Verwundbarkeit auf nach-
haltige und umweltverträgliche Weise mindert;

(cid:116)(cid:1) eine Koordinierung in Bezug auf Energieversor-
gungspolitik und Energiemix sicherstellt, um die 
Ziele der Europäischen Union im Bereich der Ener-
gieversorgungssicherheit sowohl auf nationaler als 
auch auf europäischer Ebene zu erreichen;

(cid:116)(cid:1)

zur Sicherung und Optimierung der Energieversor-
gung durch eine Konsolidierung der Zusammen-
arbeit zwischen den Mitgliedstaaten der Europäi-
schen Union im Geiste der Solidarität intelligente 
europäische Energienetze aufbaut und dezentrale 
Systeme zur Unterstützung der Energieversorgung 
entwickelt; darüber hinaus sollten – soweit möglich 
– dezentrale Systeme wie die Mikroerzeugung von 
Energie gefördert werden.

4.4  Nachhaltigkeit

Die derzeitigen Energieträger nutzen in erster Linie 
Energie, die in – per definitionem begrenzten – fossilen 
Ressourcen wie Öl, Brennstoffen und Gas gespeichert 
ist. Auch andere Energiequellen wie etwa die Kern-
spaltung hängen von Rohstoffen ab, die nur begrenzt 
verfügbar sind. Energiesysteme, die auf den oben ge-
nannten Stoffen basieren, sind immer weniger tragbar, 
und alternative, erneuerbare Energieträger spielen in-
zwischen in der europäischen und der weltweiten Ener-
giedebatte eine wichtige Rolle. Energieeinsparung ist 
ein zentrales Leitprinzip bei der Energieerzeugung und 
-verteilung. Deshalb sollten alle Maßnahmen ergriffen 
werden, die zu einer höheren Effizienz und einer Re-
duzierung des Energieverbrauchs beitragen können.

Dekarbonisierungspolitik für die Zukunft auf den Weg 
zu bringen.

Der gegenwärtige und künftige Zugang zu Energie, 
der sowohl aufgrund des Schwindens der Reserven 
als auch angesichts der Umweltauswirkungen – eines 
entscheidenden Faktors für den Klimawandel – Proble-
me aufwirft, zwingt die Entscheidungsträger, sich mit 
Fragen der Generationengerechtigkeit und -verantwor- 
tung auseinanderzusetzen.

Die EU hat mit ihrer Energie- und Umweltpolitik be-
reits Entscheidungen zugunsten eines Übergangs von 
nichterneuerbaren zu erneuerbaren Energiequellen 
getroffen. Dieses Ziel kann jedoch nur dann erreicht 
werden, wenn der Energiemix, auf den derzeit gesetzt 
wird, regelmäßig im Lichte dieses übergeordneten 
Ziels bewertet wird. Angesichts der aktuellen Daten 
zum Klimawandel empfiehlt die EGE, dass die EU ihre 
Politik eng an internationalen ökologischen und öko-
nomischen Expertisen ausrichtet, wenn es um die Fra-
gen geht, wie rasch der Übergang vollzogen werden 
kann und ab wann der Energiemix aus nichterneuerba-
ren und erneuerbaren Energien kontraproduktiv wird. 
Im Zuge der Bewertungsarbeiten sollte eine verglei-
chende Methodik – wie von der EGE vorgeschlagen – 
ausgearbeitet und auf transparente Weise angewandt 
werden. Die EGE empfiehlt, dass die Europäische Union 
Maßnahmen trifft, um

1.  die Emissionen von Kohlendioxid und anderen 
Treibhausgasen bei der Energieerzeugung zu re-
duzieren, wie im Energiefahrplan 2050 ins Auge 
gefasst;

2.  durch fiskalische oder andere zweckdienliche Maß-
nahmen die Entwicklung und Nutzung von Tech-
nologien mit geringem CO2-Ausstoß unter beson-
derer Berücksichtigung erneuerbarer Energien zu 
fördern;

3.  sicherzustellen, dass alle möglichen Anstrengun-
gen zur Verbesserung der Energieeffizienz und zur 
Reduzierung des Energieverbrauchs unternommen 
werden, wobei – mit Blick auf die Realisierung die-
ses Ziels – folgenden Umsetzungsmaßnahmen be-
sonderes Augenmerk gelten sollte:

a)  Aufbau intelligenter Netze,

Die Umwandlung der in fossilen Brennstoffen ge-
speicherten Energie hat erhebliche Konsequenzen 
für das Klima, was die EU dazu bewogen hat, eine 

b)  Förderung von Anreizen und Festlegung nor-
mativer Anforderungen mit dem Ziel, Ener-
gieerzeugung und -nutzung in den Bereichen 

77

4 | EMPFEHLUNGEN

Verkehr, Baugewerbe, Heizen usw. (Energienut-
zungen von nachrangiger Bedeutung, Anreize 
für energieeffiziente Stadtsanierung) zu redu-
zieren und zu verteilen;

c)  Förderung von Maßnahmen, die darauf abstel-
len, auf erneuerbaren Energiequellen basie-
rende Technologien für benachteiligte gesell-
schaftliche Gruppen verfügbar zu machen;

das Bewusstsein von Bürgerinnen und Bür-
4. 
gern (bereits im jungen Alter) für neue Verhaltens- und 
Lebensweisen im Interesse einer verantwortungsvollen 
Energienutzung durch Förderung und Finanzierung 
entsprechender Bildungsprojekte und Sensibilisie-
rungsmaßnahmen (z. B. von Nachhaltigkeitsprojekten 
in Schulen) zu schärfen;

regelmäßig die unterschiedlichen Strategien 
5. 
der Mitgliedstaaten zu bewerten, insbesondere hin-
sichtlich der Nutzung „konventioneller“, „CO2-armer“ 
und „erneuerbarer“ Energiequellen.

4.5  Forschung

Energieforschung ist von zentraler Bedeutung für die 
Verwirklichung der im Energiefahrplan 2050 erklärten 
Ziele der Europäischen Union. Die Forschungsprioritä-
ten müssen mit diesen Zielen in Einklang stehen und 
sollten sich an dem von der EGE in der vorliegenden 
Stellungnahme dargelegten integrativen Ethikkon-
zept ausrichten. Die EGE unterstreicht, wie wichtig es 
für Europa ist, in die Forschung von Technologien mit 
geringem CO2-Ausstoß zu investieren, insbesondere in 
erneuerbare Energien. Daher empfiehlt die EGE, For-
schungsprioritäten festzulegen, die Forschungsarbei-
ten zu folgenden Bereichen umfassen sollten:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

Technologien, die zum Aufbau einer intelligen-
ten  Netzinfrastruktur  in  Europa  beitragen,  die 
so konfiguriert ist, dass ausreichend Kapazitäten 
vorhanden sind, um die potenziellen Vorteile von 
Technologien mit geringem CO2-Ausstoß und Tech-
nologien für erneuerbare Energien auszuschöpfen, 
vor allem bei der Entwicklung einer dezentralen 
Energieerzeugung;

Zusammenhang mit der Energieerzeugung und 
-nutzung benötigtem Material und anfallenden 
Rückständen;

(cid:116)(cid:1) Analysen zu den bei verschiedenen Energiequel-
len anfallenden Rückständen, ihrer Reduzierung 
oder Beseitigung oder etwaigen Wiederverwen-
dung; Forschungsarbeiten zur Ermittlung der am 
besten geeigneten Technologien, Vorschriften 
und Infrastrukturen für die CO2-Abscheidung und 
Speicherung;

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

Energieeffizienz  in  allen  Bereichen,  vor  allem 
aber in Städteplanung und Architektur, Verkehr, 
öffentlichen  Versorgungseinrichtungen  und 
Industrieanlagen;

Forschungsfinanzierung für laufende Arbeiten auf 
dem Gebiet der psychosozialen Modellierung von 
Verhaltensinterventionen bei Einzelpersonen und 
Gemeinschaften im Bereich der Energieeinspa-
rung mit dem Ziel, Energieeffizienzinitiativen und 
die Festlegung neuer Standards – über die derzeit 
bestehende „Best Practice“ hinaus – zu befördern.

Es gilt, ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen For-
schungsarbeiten zu den verschiedenen Energiequellen 
herzustellen und die Gründe hierfür darzulegen (und 
öffentlich bekannt zu machen):

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

vergleichende Studien zur Umsetzung des Ener-
giefahrplans 2050 in den Mitgliedstaaten der Eu-
ropäischen Union (quantitative und qualitative 
Daten) mit einem besonderen Schwerpunkt auf 
soziokulturellen und geografischen Faktoren, die 
ausschlaggebend für die Festlegung spezifischer 
Energiemixsysteme auf lokaler Ebene sind;

vergleichende Folgenabschätzungen für alle Ener-
giequellen unter Zugrundelegung der integrati-
ven Methode technischer, sozialer und politischer 
Szenarien;  dabei  sollten  (soziale,  ökologische) 
Worst-Case-Szenarien, kurzfristige und langfristi-
ge Prognosen, geopolitische Kontexte und auch 
Sicherheitsrisiken für die Arbeitnehmer berück-
sichtigt werden;

(cid:116)(cid:1) neue Energiespeichertechnologien, die bei Erzeu-
gung von Überschüssen die Nutzung intermittie-
render Energien erleichtern;

(cid:116)(cid:1)

Sozialwissenschaften (individuelle Verantwortung), 
Psychologie, Sozialanthropologie, Soziologie, Ethik 
und Recht.

(cid:116)(cid:1)

interdisziplinäre  Forschung  auf  dem  Gebiet 
der  Lagerung  und  der  Beförderung  von  im 

Die EGE ist – wie auch in den vorangegangenen Stel-
lungnahmen dargelegt – der Auffassung, dass die

(cid:116)(cid:1) dass die Europäische Union und ihre Organe eine 
Einrichtung  unter  der  Bezeichnung  „Ombuds-
person“ schaffen, deren Aufgabe es sein soll, die 
Interessen künftiger Generationen zu vertreten, 
deren Funktion nicht darin bestehen würde, Ent-
scheidungen zu treffen, sondern vielmehr darin, 
dafür zu sorgen, dass Entscheidungen in Kenntnis 
der Sachlage getroffen werden, indem sie die Lang-
zeitwirkungen sämtlicher politischer, sozioökono-
mischer und technologischer Entscheidungen in 
die Debatte einbringt.

Entwicklung von Wissenschaft und Technologie eine 
kritische und unabhängige ethische Analyse erfordert, 
die durch eine Unterstützung der ethischen Fachdiszi-
plin erleichtert werden kann. Um diesen Prozess vor-
anzubringen, empfiehlt die Gruppe daher interdiszipli-
näre Forschungsarbeiten zu den ethischen, rechtlichen 
und sozialen Implikationen der Energienutzung (the-
matisches Programm); entsprechende Vorhaben soll-
ten im Rahmen von Horizont 2020 finanziert werden.

4.6  Demokratische Diskurse, Partizipati-

onsinstrumente und Verantwortung für 
künftige Generationen

Der demokratische Diskurs ist von wesentlicher Bedeu-
tung für die Entscheidungen, die Bürgerinnen und Bür-
ger als Antwort auf die Herausforderungen im Bereich 
der Energieerzeugung und -nutzung treffen. In den 
vergangenen Jahrzehnten wurden verschiedene Inst-
rumente zur Stärkung von Partizipationsmechanismen 
erforscht.

Die EGE empfiehlt, dass die Europäische Union Anrei-
ze für die Implementierung partizipatorischer Ansätze 
setzt, z. B. in folgenden Bereichen:

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

(cid:116)(cid:1)

„Anhörungen“ der Zivilgesellschaft;

kommunale  und  regionale  Energiegenossen-
schaften;

kommunale Energieeinsparungsinitiativen;

kommunale und regionale Initiativen zur Förderung 
einer auf einen reduzierten CO2-Ausstoß abzielen-
den Stadtentwicklung und Kommunalplanung.

Sowohl die räumliche als auch die zeitliche Dimension 
der Folgen menschlichen Handelns spielen eine wich-
tige Rolle in der Energieethik. Die heutige Generation 
steht vor der ethischen Herausforderung, ihre morali-
sche Perspektive zu erweitern und sich ernsthaft mit 
den Langzeitwirkungen zu befassen, die ihre Entschei-
dungen und ihr Handeln für die Nachwelt haben. Diese 
Herausforderung erwächst aus den Erfordernissen so-
zialer Gerechtigkeit; dabei geht es um den Grundsatz, 
dass eine Gemeinschaft aus menschlicher Solidarität 
heraus moralisch verpflichtet ist, denen Hilfe zu leisten, 
die benachteiligt sind.

Daher empfiehlt die EGE,

CONVENTIONS FOR ELECTRICITY

Figures for electricity production, trade, and ﬁnal 
consumption are calculated using the energy content 
of the electricity (i.e. at a rate of 1 TWh = 0.086 Mtoe). 
Hydroelectric production (excluding pumped storage) and 
electricity produced by other non-thermal means (wind, 
tide/wave/ocean, photovoltaic, etc.) are accounted for 
similarly using 1 TWh = 0.086 Mtoe. However, the primary 
energy equivalent of nuclear electricity is calculated 
from the gross generation by assuming 33 % conversion 
eﬃciency (i.e. 1 TWh = (0.086 ÷ 0.33) Mtoe). In the case 
of electricity produced from geothermal heat, if the actual 
geothermal eﬃciency is not known, then the primary 
equivalent is calculated assuming 10 % eﬃciency, so 1 
TWh = (0.086 ÷ 0.1) Mtoe.

GLOSSARY

137

GLOSSARY

 Coal/peat

 Coal/peat includes all coal, both primary (including hard coal and lignite) and derived fuels (including 
patent fuel, coke oven coke, gas coke, BKB (brown coal briquettes), gas works gas, coke oven gas, blast 
furnace gas and other recovered gases). Peat is also included in this category.

Hard coal

 Hard coal comprises anthracite, coking coal and other bituminous coal.

Steam coal

 Steam coal comprises anthracite, other bituminous coal and sub-bituminous coal.

Crude oil

Oil products

 Crude oil comprises crude oil, natural gas liquids, reﬁnery feedstocks and additives as well as other 
hydrocarbons.

 Oil products comprises reﬁnery gas, ethane, LPG (liqueﬁed petroleum gas), aviation gasoline, petrol, 
jet fuels, kerosene, gas/diesel oil, fuel oil, naphtha, white spirit, lubricants, bitumen, paraﬃn waxes, 
petroleum coke and other oil products.

Natural gas

 Natural gas includes both ‘associated’ and ‘non-associated’ gas.

Nuclear

Hydro

Biofuels and waste

Other

 Nuclear shows the primary heat equivalent of the electricity produced by a nuclear power plant with 
an average thermal eﬃciency of 33 %.

 Hydro shows the energy content of the electricity produced in hydropower plants. Hydro output excludes 
output from pumped storage plants.

 Biofuels and waste comprises solid biofuels, liquid biofuels, biogases, industrial waste and municipal 
waste.  Biofuels  are    deﬁned  as  any  plant  matter  used  directly  as  fuel  or  converted  into  fuels  (e.g. 
charcoal) or electricity and/or heat. Included here are wood, vegetal waste (including wood waste and 
crops used for energy production), ethanol, animal materials/wastes and sulphite lyes. Municipal waste 
comprises wastes produced by residential, commercial and public services, that are collected by local 
authorities for disposal in a central location for the production of heat and/or power. 

 Other includes geothermal, solar, wind, tide/wave/ocean energy, electricity and heat. Unless the actual 
eﬃciency of the geothermal process is known, the quantity of geothermal energy entering electricity 
generation  is  inferred  from  the  electricity  production  at  geothermal  plants  assuming  an  average 
thermal eﬃciency of 10 %. For solar, wind and tide/wave/ocean energy, the quantities entering electricity 
generation are equal to the electrical energy generated. Direct use of geothermal and solar heat is also 
included here. Electricity is accounted for at the same heat value as electricity in ﬁnal consumption  
(i.e. 1 GWh = 0.000086 Mtoe). Heat includes heat that is produced for sale and is accounted for in the 
transformation sector. 

Production

 Production is the production of primary energy, i.e. hard coal, lignite, peat, crude oil, natural gas liquids 
(NGLs), natural gas, biofuels and waste, nuclear, hydro, geothermal, solar and the heat from heat pumps 
that is extracted from the ambient environment. Production is calculated a$er removal of impurities (e.g. 
sulphur from natural gas).

GLOSSA RY

 Imports and exports

 Imports and exports comprise amounts having crossed the national territorial boundaries of the country, 
whether or not customs clearance has taken place.

(a) Oil and natural gas 
 Quantities of crude oil and oil products imported or exported under processing agreements (i.e. reﬁning on 
account) are included. Quantities of oil in transit are excluded. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas are reported 
as coming from the country of origin; reﬁnery feedstocks and oil products are reported as coming from the 
country of last consignment. Re-exports of oil imported for processing within bonded areas are shown as 
exports of product from the processing country to the ﬁnal destination.

(b) Coal/peat
 Imports and exports comprise the amount of fuels obtained from or supplied to other countries, whether or 
not there is an economic or customs union between the relevant countries. Coal in transit is not included.

(c) Electricity
 Amounts are considered as imported or exported when they have crossed the national territorial boundaries 
of the country.

 International marine bunkers covers those quantities delivered to ships of all ﬂags that are engaged in 
international navigation. The international navigation may take place at sea, on inland lakes and waterways, 
and in coastal waters. Consumption by ships engaged in domestic navigation is excluded. The domestic/
international split is determined on the basis of port of departure and port of arrival, and not by the ﬂag or 
nationality of the ship. Consumption by ﬁshing vessels and by military forces is also excluded.

 International aviation bunkers covers deliveries of aviation fuels to aircra$ for international aviation. Fuels 
used by airlines for their road vehicles are excluded. The domestic/international split should be determined 
on the basis of departure and landing locations, and not by the nationality of the airline. For many countries, 
this incorrectly excludes fuel used by domestically owned carriers for their international departures.

 Stock changes reﬂects the diﬀerence between opening stock levels on the ﬁrst day of the year and 
closing levels on the last day of the year of stocks on national territory held by producers, importers, 
energy transformation industries and large consumers. A ‘stock build’ is shown as a negative number, 
and a ‘stock draw’ as a positive number.

 International  
marine bunkers

 International 
aviation bunkers

Stock changes

 Total primary  
energy supply

 Total  primary  energy  supply  (TPES)  equals  production  +  imports  –  exports  –  international  marine 
bunkers  –  international  aviation  bunkers  ±  stock  changes.  For  the  world  total,  international  marine 
bunkers and international aviation bunkers are not subtracted from the TPES.

Transfers

 Statistical 
diﬀerences

 Electricity plants

 Transfers includes inter-product transfers, products transferred and recycled products. 

 Statistical diﬀerences includes the sum of the unexplained statistical diﬀerences for individual fuels, as 
they appear in the basic energy statistics. It also includes the statistical diﬀerences that arise because 
of the variety of conversion factors in the coal/peat and oil columns.

 Electricity plants refers to plants which are designed to produce electricity only. If one or more units of 
the plant is a CHP unit (and the inputs and outputs cannot be distinguished on a unit basis) then the 
whole plant is designated as a CHP plant. Both main activity producers and autoproducer plants are 
included here.

 Combined heat and 
power plants

 Combined  heat  and  power  plants  (CHP)  refers  to  plan    ts  which  are  designed  to  produce  both  heat 
and  electricity,  sometimes  referred  to  as  cogeneration  power  stations.  If  possible,  fuel  inputs  and 
electricity/heat  outputs  are  on  a  unit  basis  rather  than  on  a  plant  basis.  However,  if  data  are  not 
available on a unit basis, the convention for deﬁning a CHP plant noted above is adopted. Both main 
activity producers and autoproducer plants are included here.

Heat plants

 Heat plants refers to plants (including heat pumps and electric boilers) designed to produce heat only, 
which  is  sold  to  a  third  party  under  the  provisions  of  a  contract.  Both  main  activity  producers  and 
autoproducer plants are included here.

GLOSSARY

139

Blast furnaces

 Blast furnaces includes inputs to and outputs of fuels from blast furnaces.

Gas works

 Coke ovens

Oil reﬁneries

 Gas  works  is  treated  similarly  to  electricity  generation,  with  the  quantity  produced  appearing  as  a 
positive ﬁgure in the coal/peat column or the natural gas column a$er blending with natural gas, inputs 
as negative entries in the coal/peat and oil products columns, and conversion losses appearing in the 
total column.

 Coke  ovens  includes  losses  in  transformation  of  coal  from  primary  to  secondary  fuels  and  from 
secondary to tertiary fuels (hard coal to coke and patent fuel, lignite to BKB, etc.). 

 Oil reﬁneries shows the use of primary energy for the manufacture of ﬁnished oil products and the 
corresponding output. Thus, the total reﬂects transformation losses. In certain cases, the data in the 
total column are positive numbers. This can be due to either problems in the primary reﬁnery balance 
or to the fact that the IEA uses regional net caloriﬁc values for oil products. 

 Petrochemical plants  Petrochemical plants covers backﬂows returned from the petrochemical industry. Note that backﬂows 
from  oil  products  that  are  used  for  non-energy  purposes  (i.e.  white  spirit  and  lubricants)  are  not 
included here, but in non-energy use.

Liquefaction plants

 Liquefaction plants includes diverse liquefaction processes, such as coal liquefaction plants and gas-
to-liquid plants.

 Other  transformation  covers  non-speciﬁed  transformation  not  shown  elsewhere,  such  as  the 
transformation of primary solid biofuels into charcoal.

 Energy industry  
own use

 Energy  industry  own  use  includes  the  primary  and  secondary  energy  consumed  by  transformation 
industries for heating, pumping, traction and lighting purposes (ISIC (International Standard Industrial 
Classiﬁcation of all Economic Activities) 05, 06, 19 and 35, Group 091 and Classes 0892 and 0721).

Losses

 Losses includes losses in energy distribution, transmission and transport. 

 Total ﬁnal 
consumption

Industry

 Total ﬁnal consumption (TFC) is the sum of consumption by the diﬀerent end-use sectors. Backﬂows 
from the petrochemical industry are not included in ﬁnal consumption.

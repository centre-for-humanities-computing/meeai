THE EUROPEAN GROUP ON ETHICS IN 
SCIENCE AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES (EGE) 

The  EGE  has  now  completed  a  series  of 
meetings  with  presidents  or  secretaries  of 
national  ethics  committees  or  similar  bodies  in 
the  new  member  states.  All  new  member  states 
except Poland have a national ethics committee, 
but  such  a  committee  is  in  the  process  of  being 
created also in Poland. In the new member states 
there  are  both  differences  and  similarities 
between  these  bodies  in  terms  of  composition, 
resources,  frequency  of  meetings,  the  way  the 
minutes  or  reports  of  the  committees  are  made 
public.  For  example,  the  number  of  members 
varies from about 12 to almost twice that number, 
the frequency of meetings varies from two to four 
times  a  year  to  meetings  at  least  once  every 
month.  The  resources  vary  from  none  to  office 
and  salary  for  two  secretaries.  One  committee 
finances its work partly by fees for opinions given 
to pharmaceutical companies. Some committees 
have  a  website  and  publish  a  news  letter, 
whereas the minutes of other committees are not 
published. 

interesting  as 

The  similarities  are  as 
the 
differences. Several common problems emerged. 
A main obstacle for many committees is the lack 
of  adequate  resources.  Another  is  the  lack  of 
ethical  debate  in  the  scientific  community  and  in 
the  general  public.  These  problems  are  not 
independent  of  each  other:  without  adequate 
resources it becomes difficult to publish opinions 
and  take  part  in  activities  which  would  help  to 
stimulate  the  ethics  debate  in  the  country.  This 
could  create  a  negative  spiral  in  that  the  lack  of 
debate  is  used  as  a  reason  for  not  allocating 
resources 
the  national  ethics  committee. 
Another problem facing several committees is the 
close attachment to one particular ministry. If the

would more easily be perceived as independent, 
rather  than  as  the  prolonged  arm  of  a  particular 
ministry.

These  meetings  have  been  very  fruitful  and 
created a basis for an agenda of future work. As 
a result of these meetings, the EGE is planning a 
series  of  activities.  One  of  the  first  of  these 
activities  will  be  a  meeting  with  the  presidents 
and secretaries of the national ethics committees 
on  the  conditions  of  independence  and  being 
able  to  stimulate  the  public  debate  on  broad 
bioethical issues.

Opinion published in 2004 

Opinion  19:  Ethical  aspects  of  umbilical  cord 
blood banking (16th March 2004) 

The  Group  issued  its  opinion  on  the  ethical 
aspects  of  umbilical  cord  blood  banking 
following a request from President Prodi in 2001. 
The  request  followed  concerns  expressed  by 
members  of 
the  European  Parliament  on 
commercial cord blood banks.  

its  opinion 

the  EGE  met 
To  prepare 
representatives  of 
the  different  stakeholders 
involved,  in  particular  representatives  of  public 
as  well  as  commercial  cord  blood  banks,  of 
networks  and  registries,  as  well  as  the  secretary 
of 
the  French  National  Consultative  Ethics 
Committee  which  had  already  issued  an  opinion 
on this issue.  

In  its  previous  opinion  no.  11  on  the  ethical 
aspects  of  tissue  banking,  the  Group  underlined 
the  values  at  stake,  in  particular,  body  integrity, 
respect  of  privacy  and  confidentiality  of  data, 
promotion  of  solidarity,  fairness  of  access  to 
healthcare  and  information  and  consent  of  the 
donors.  The  ethical  implications  of  umbilical 
cord blood banking are the same as for any tissue 
bank.  

There are however commercial banks which offer 
to  collect  and  store  the  cord  blood  of your  child 
for  a  number  of  years  against  payment  in  case 
that  one  day  your  child  needs  it,  or  one  of  the 
family members. Nevertheless, the probability of 
needing  an  autologous  transplantation  is  almost 
negligible  and  moreover  it  has  not  yet  been 
demonstrated that cells usable for transplantation 
can be stored for more than 15 years.  

Although there is a lot of research performed on 
stem  cells,  there  is  as  yet  no  clear  proof  of  the 
utility of stem cells and the possibility to use cord 
blood  stem  cells  for  regenerative  medicine  is 
currently  purely  hypothetical.  Even  if  research 
would  show  the  utility  of  cord  blood  cells  in 
these  cases,  it  is  not  evident  that  the  use  of 
patient’s  own  cord  blood would  be preferable  to 
the  use  of  his/her  own  bone  marrow  or  to  well-
matched allogeneic stem cells from donation. It is 
therefore  highly  hypothetical  that  cord  blood 
cells kept for autologous use will be of any value 
in the future.

This is the reason why the EGE is of the opinion 
that  “the  legitimacy  of  commercial  cord  blood 
banks  for  autologous  use  should  be  questioned 
as they sell a service which has presently no real  
use  regarding  therapeutic  options”.  However, 
“support  for  public  cord  blood  banks  for 
allogeneic transplantations should be increased 
and  long  term  functioning  should  be  assured”. 
The  development  of  networks  and  registries  to 
make 
needing 
any 
transplantation will find rapidly a matching donor 
and a suitable sample, should also be encouraged 
and supported.  
“While  some  members  of  the  Group  consider 
that this activity should be banned, the majority 
considers  that  the  activities  of  these  banks 
should  be  discouraged  but  that  a  strict  ban 
would  represent  an  undue  restriction  on  the 
freedom of enterprise and the freedom of choice 
of individuals/couples.”  
“If  commercial  cord  blood  banks  are  allowed, 
appropriate  information  should  be  given  to  the 
their  services, 
consumers  willing 
including  the  fact  that  the  likelihood  that  the 
sample  may  be  used  to  treat  one’s  child  is 
currently  negligible,  that  the  future  therapeutic 
possibilities  are  of  a  very  hypothetical  nature 
and that up until now there is no indication that 
the  present  research  will

therapeutic application of one’s own cord blood 
cells.  Therefore, 
to  be 
particularly  explicit  that  the  auto  conservation 
has  little  value  in  the  current  state  of  scientific 
knowledge.  This  information  should  be  made 
clear  on  all  media,  including  Internet,  and  in 
any contracts linking commercial banks to their 
customers.”

The  EGE  welcomes  the  adoption  of  Directive 
2004/23/EC of 31st March 2004 of the European 
Parliament  and  of 
the  Council  on  setting 
standards  of  quality  and  safety  for  the  donation, 
procurement,  testing,  processing,  preservation, 
storage  and  distribution  of  human  tissues  and 
cells1, which provides a legal framework, notably 
in terms of authorization, licensing, accreditation, 
inspections,  controls,  promotions  and  publicity 
and staff experience.  
The  Group  also  insists  that  “any  kind  of 
advertising  made  by  commercial  cord  blood 
banks  in  the  media,  including  on  the  Internet, 
must  be  adequately  controlled  by  public 
authorities”.

hearing  experts  representing  different  fields  of 
experiment and viewpoints in this area.  
However,  in  the  meantime,  the  EGE  received  a 
request  from  President  Prodi  to  comment  on  the 
ethical  aspects  of 
the  new  Commission 
proposal  for  a  regulation  on  human  tissue 
engineered products. The EGE contribution will 
be  part  of  the  impact  assessment  study  which  is 
done prior to any new legislation. 

EGE activities in the first semester 2004 
At  the  end  of  2003  and  beginning  of  2004,  in 
order to get to know the EGE  counterparts in 
the new Member States, the EGE Chairman has 
been  inviting  to  Brussels  representatives  of  the 
National  Ethics  Committees  of  these  countries. 
The  EGE  secretariat  will  publish  a  summary  of 
the  meetings  together  with  some  proposals  for 
future collaboration. 
From  17th  to  19th  May  2004,  under  the  Irish 
Presidency  of  the  European  Union,  the  EGE 
held its meeting in Dublin. It met the members of 
the Irish Council for Bioethics with whom it had 
a  discussion  on  the  ethical  issues  related  to 
tissues  and  organs.  A  meeting  at

BIOETHICS COMMISSION 

The  Austrian  Bioethics  Commission  was 
established  at  the  Federal  Chancellery  by  an 
order,  issued  by  the  Federal  Chancellor,  on  29 
June 2001. The constituent  meeting was held on  
2nd  July  2001.  The  main  task  of  the  Bioethics 
Commission  is  to  advise  the  Federal  Chancellor 
from  an  ethical  point  of  view  on  all  social, 
natural scientific and legal issues arising from the 
scientific  developments  in  human  medicine  and 
human biology. 

and 

The  members  of  the  Commission  are  appointed 
for  a  period  of  two  years  with  the  possibility  of 
re-appointment.  In  October  2003  the  Federal 
Chancellor  re-appointed  all  19  members  of  the 
Bioethics  Commission.  The  Federal  Chancellor

First  the  method  of  functioning  of  the  Advisory 
Committee  on  Bio-Ethics  should  be  described.  
Its composition and its aims have been explained 
in an article in the first publication of this series. 
It  immediately  appeared  that  the  mission  of  the 
Committee  was  to  formulate,  on  the  various 
issues,  the  different  ethical  attitudes  existing 
among the Committee members.

respects firmly the diversity of philosophical and 
religious  opinions  present  in  our  society;  from 
such  diverging  opinions,  no  compromise  could 
ever result. 
Between  May  1997  and  April  2004,  we  have 
published  27  Recommendations,  which  are 
available 
Website 
(www.health.fgov.be/bioeth).    Only  a  few  of 
these Recommendations will be discussed in this 
overview.  
Recommendations  1  and  9  concern  decisions 
about the end of life. Recommendation 1 mainly

concerns  the  issue  of  ending  the  life  of  patients 
who are definitively unable to express their will, 
and questions the value to be attributed to living

problems in the care of demented persons.

In 
Recommendations  1  and  9,  however,  we  can 
distinguish  divergent  philosophical  or  religious 
opinions, and these are expressed by 4 groups of 
members. 
According  to  a  first  group,  palliative  care  has  to 
match  patient’s  needs,  and  from  an  ethical  point 
of view, they think that active measures to end a 
patient’s life are not allowed.  Their priority lies 
in expressing solidarity by guaranteeing comfort, 
the  absence  of  suffering, 
compassion  and 
ensuring  in  this  way  respect  of  the  patient’s 
dignity. 
For another group of members, every person has 
the  right  to  decide  about  his  or  her  dead  (either 
during  the  terminal  episode  or  by  a  living  will).  
This  decision  should  be  made  by  the  patient,  or 
by  a  trusted  person,  under  the  guidance  of  the 
treating physician. 
Two  groups  of  members  hold 
intermediary 
positions, and base them on respectively a priori 
or a posteriori conditions.

of 

Recommendation  14  recognizes  the  absence  of 
Belgian  regulations  concerning  situations  faced 
by  demented  persons,  and  insists  on  the  formal 
designation  of  a  representative  of  the  demented 
person.  This representative should be designated 
e.g. before a notary public.    This representative 
would be authorised to take decisions concerning 
acceptable  living  conditions,  home  assistance, 
placement  or  hospitalisation  of  the  demented 
person. 
All  members  of  the  Committee  agree  on  the 
importance  of  developing  written  guidelines 
allowing  trustees  or  relatives,  to  be  in  charge  of 
decisions  about  the  demented  person  concerning 
the organisation of his daily life, with all respect 
for  the  person’s  wishes.  But  members’  opinions 
diverge  on  the  issue  of  living  wills  for  active 
termination  of  life;  likewise,  opinions  diverge 
about  mentioning  in  a  living  will  that  the 
demented  person  could  be 
included  as  an 
experimental  subject 
in  a  clinical  research 
project.   
For  some  members,  active  termination  of  life  of 
demented patients remains unacceptable, and for 
them  a  demented  person  should  never  be 
included  in  a  research  programme,  unless  the 
patient is directly benefiting from the experiment. 
Others  consider  on  the  contrary  that  taking 
anticipated  decisions  for  use 
the  person 
becomes dement is a human right. From there on, 
the persons’ wish to actively decide to terminate 
his  life  in  case  of  dementia  deserves  absolute 
respect.  Some  members  accept  in  this  case  that 
no  treatment  of  intercurring  diseases  should  be 
done  in  a  demented  patient.    Others,  however, 
while  rejecting  heroic  measures  (“acharnement 
thérapeutique”),  do  accept  that  treatment  of 
somatic  diseases  affecting  demented  persons, 
should continue. Finally, some members consider 
that when anticipatively stipulated by the patient, 
participation  in  clinical  research  programmes 
without  any  personal  benefit  is  allowed.  For 
others, taking part in such programmes should be 
possible, even when causing some distress to the 
patient,  provided  that  one  might  realistically 
expect other patients to benefit from the research. 
The meaning of ‘solidarity’ is, of course, not the 
same  for  all  members  of  the  Committee.  For 
some,  it  exists  only  as  solidarity  from  the 
the  weakest.  For  others, 
strongest 
solidarity  means  also 
the  weak  can 
contribute, if the majority will benefit. 
Further  in  Recommendation  14,  as  well  as  in

members insist on the necessity of establishing a 
legal  body  to  intervene  in  all  decisions  for  a 
person  regarded  as  partially  or  totally  unable  to 
defend his own interests. 
Nevertheless,  the  members  of  the  Committee 
insist  that  the  legal  statute  of  incapability  does 
not imply total lack of capability and initiative of 
a  person  in  all  matters.  Sterilisation  will  thus 
never  be  motivated  solely  by  the  fact  that  a 
person is legally incapable.  Concerning patients 
under psychiatric care, mentally disabled patients 
or  demented  persons,  one  has 
to  carefully 
examine  the  actual  capability  of  the  person  to 
express and act willingly in such or such matter.  
One has, when it occurs, to respect the expressed 
will.

do  not  agree  on  systematic

The  Committee  also  insists  on  the  obligation  to 
obtain  informed  consent  from  any  person  taking 
part  in  a  research  programme.    This  implies 
complete 
and 
understandable terms, of the consequences of the 
participation in the experimental programme. 
The Committee suggests that protocols of clinical 
trials  should  continue  to  be  evaluated  by  local 
ethics  committees,  and  that  these  committees 
should  also  take  care  of  the  follow-up  of  these 
trials.    Not  all  members  of  the  Committee  agree 
that  the  advice  of  a  local  ethics  committee  on  a 
protocol  should  be  binding.    A  negative  advice 
on  a  research  programme  undertaken  on  human 
beings  should  at  any  rate,  be  communicated  to 
the persons solicited for participation in the trial.

Recommendation  27  questions  the  ethical  basis 
of  donations  of  spermatozoïds  and  ovule.  All 
Committee  members  accept  in  vitro  fertilisation 
as  ethically  acceptable.  It  is  thought  that  the 
number  of  operating  units  should  guarantee  an 
optimal  quality  of  functioning  and  of  medical 
treatment.    It  is  accepted  that  considerations 
about  cost  for  the  community  are  important  but 
equal access for everybody should be assured. 
There are various opinions about whether access 
to  gametes,  or  in  vitro  fertilisation  techniques,

The  Committee  underlines 
the  necessity  of 
restricting research processes on embryos to high 
quality  projects  by  qualified  scientists,  having 
received a positive advice from their local ethics 
committee, linked to a university.   
Embryos submitted to such research programmes 
should  never  be  reimplanted.  All  experimental 
acts on embryos, once duly approved, are subject 
to  the  approval  of  the  persons  from  which  the

There  are  therefore  within  the  Committee  a 
number of diverging attitudes. 
Some members only accept research on embryos 
which  are  left  over  after  the  end  of  the  parental 
project for in vitro fertilisation. Others consider it 
ethically correct to produce embryos for research 
programmes. For some of the members, research 
on  embryos  under  the  age  of  14  days  is 
acceptable. Others don’t think it is useful to fix a 
limit  of  age.  Finally  all  members  agree  on  the 
prohibition of commercialisation of embryos. 
In Recommendation 24 on human stem cells and 
on  therapeutical  cloning,  some  of  the  members

In  Recommendation  3  the  Committee  approves

questions the ethical foundations of sex-selection 
for  non-medical  reasons.  Members’  opinions 
differ.    For  some,  choosing  the  sex of a  child  to 
be  born  will  never  be  justified,  as  the  selection 
will  be  based  on  a  normal  human  characteristic. 
Others estimate that in the absence of a predicted 
ethical profit brought by bio-technical innovation 
in this field, sex-selection must be rejected. Some 
members  estimate 
that  parental  autonomy 
extends  to  choosing  the  sex  of  their  child.  For 
some  of  them,  the  extension  is  absolute.  For 
some others, extension should be granted, and for 
some only with great care, in the frame of family-

prove  to  be  100%  reliable  in  forecasting  a

ETHICS COMMITTEES IN CROATIA 

the 

first 

steps 

towards 

the  clinical  drug 

The 
bioethics 
institutionalization through ethics committees, in 
Croatia, were done in 1970-ties. It was then that 
the  first  IRBs  (Institutional  Review  Boards) 
emerged.  Those  committees  were  called  “the 
hospital  drug  committees”  and  were  formed  in 
the  biggest  clinical  hospitals  in  Croatia.  These 
bodies  were  involved  in  methodological  and 
ethical  analysis  of 
trials. 
Additional, impetus for the further establishment 
of  the  ethics  committees  in  Croatia  followed  in 
1990  when  Croatian  Medical  Association 
founded  the  Committee  for  the  Medical  Ethics 
and  the  Human  Rights.  That  was  in  a  very 
difficult time of the Croatian Patriotic war with a 
lot of ethical problems. 
After the reestablishment of the Croatian Medical 
Chamber  in  1995,  this  committee  became  the 
official 
both 
review 
associations. The main task of the Committee for 
the  Medical  Ethics  and  Deontology  of  the 
Croatian  Medical  Association  and  Croatian 
Medical Chamber was to review all possible and 
reported breaches of its Code of Ethics (accepted 
in 1993 with additions 1997 and 2002). However, 
in 
late  1990-ties  Croatian  Medical 
Association and Croatian Medical Chamber went 
their own ways so today there are two (medical) 
ethical  boards  present  in  each  of  the  two 
institutions  who  have  two  separate  but  basically 
the  same  ethical  codes.  One  of 
the  more 
important differences is the sentence put recently 
into  the  Chamber’s  code  “Continued  intensive 
treatment  of  irreversibly  terminally  ill  patient  is 
not  only  medically  unfounded  but  also  excludes 
patient’s right to a dignified death”.

In  1997 
the 
establishment  of  ethics  committees  came  about. 
In  the  Law  on  the  Health  Protection  from  1997 
articles  51  and  52  were  consecrated  to  the 
framework-setting 
the  work  of  ethic 
committees. According to the law each healthcare 
institution  in  Croatia  should  have  an  ethics 
committees  consisted  of  five  members  of  whom 
two  people  should  be  out  of  the  medical  field. 
The  ethics  committees  have 
the  following 
functions:   

for 

•  They 

follow 

the 

implementation  of 

ethical principles of medical profession 

•  They  approve 

the  research  activities 

(protocols) within the health institution 
•  They  oversee  the  drug  and  medical 

device trails

•  They  oversee  the  organ  procurement 

form the dead persons 

•  They  solve  other  ethical  issues  in  the 

health institution. 

According  to  these  legal  provisions  the  ethics 
committees  in  healthcare  institutions  in  Croatia 
are  required  in  their  everyday  work  to  combine 
functions of an IRB and a HEC (healthcare ethics 
committee).

In  2001,  the  National  Bioethics  Committee  for 
Medicine  of  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of 
Croatia  (NBCM)  was  founded.  This 
is  an 
independent advisory and multidisciplinary body 
involved  in  systematic  analysis  of  ethical  and 
legal 
the  development  and 
implementation  of  the  biomedical  sciences.  It 
issues  recommendations,  guidelines  and  reports 
for  the  legal  documents  connected  with  the 
different ethical issues. It has twenty members of 
whom  seven  are  women.  There  is  a  present 
awareness  of 
in 
international  declarations  and  documents  in  the 
work of the NBCM. 
The  NBCM  follows  international  documents  on 
ethics  and  advises  government  about 
their 
ratification  and  implementation.  In  2003  the 
NBCM  organized  for  the  first  time  a  two-day 
workshop  for  the  members  of  ethics  committees 
in  Croatia.  The  impact  of  this  meeting  on  the 
activities  of  ethical  bodies  in  Croatia  was  and 
should  be  very  good.  The  participants  expressed 
their  wish  to  continue  with  such  workshops 
which  will

functioning. 
The members of the NBMC also participated in a 
two-day meeting with Papal Academy- Pontificia 
Academia Pro Vita in Rome. 
The  NBCM  and  its  members  was  active  in  the 
preparation 
assisted 
reproduction,  Law  on  patient’s  rights  and  in 
discussions of a number of ethical issues dealing 
with  changes  of  the  management  of  the  biggest 
Croatian  hospitals,  availability  of  corpses  for 
teaching of anatomy, activities of various ethical 
committees  of  big  hospitals,  Medical  Chamber 
etc.  All  these  have  been  presented  in  the  report 
prepared 
the 
government  of  Croatia  several  months  ago.  The 
reaction is still awaited. 
Furthermore  one  of  the  members  of  NBCM,  Dr 
Dubravka  Šimonović  is  a  president  of  CDBI  of 
the  Council  of  Europe.  Another  member  of 
NBCM, Professor Božidar Vrhovac, became in

connected  with  deontology  of  a  profession. 
About the work of ethics committees in scientific

that  one  can  presume  that  their  function  is 
primary  one  of  a  research  ethics  committee.  All 
these  committees,  of  course,  greatly  vary  in  the 
intensity  of  their  activities  but  the  trend  is 
positive  and  the  awareness  of  the  importance  of 
dealing with ethical issues is increasing.

institutions  asking 

A circular letter was sent by NBCM to all above 
mentioned 
the  following 
information: 
-Does an ethics committee exist? 
-If there is an ethics committee in the institution: 
a)  What  is  the  number  of  members,  their 
profession and function within the ethics 
committee 
co-chairman, 
secretary)? 

(chairman, 

b)  What  type  of  work  has  the  committee 
done  so  far  (number  and  regularity  of 
meetings,  the  main  topics  that  were 
discussed,  what  kind  of  decisions  were 
made)? 

c)  Are 

there  any  official  documents 
(standing  orders,  working  guidelines)  of 
the committee? 

d)  Are  there  any  other  committees  (eg: 
committee  for 
transplantation)  except 
their  ethics  committee  working  in  their 
institution? 

The response rate to the circular letter sent by the 
National Bioethics Committee was between 100-
75%  depending  on  the  type  of  the  institution 
(100%  response  rate  for  clinical  hospitals  and 
clinical  medical  centers,  91%  for  regional  and 
local  general  hospitals,  80%  for  clinics  and 
policlinics, 75% for medical faculties and around 
77% for all the other healthcare institutions (state 
health institutes, primary care clinics, emergency 
medicine clinics except for pharmacies and home 
care  institutions  which  were  excluded  from  the 
survey). The response was also obtained from all 
major  scientific  institutes  that  are  involved  in 
human research in Croatia.  

The  results  of  this  survey  showed  that  of  241 
healthcare  institutions,  (without  pharmacies  and 
home care institutions which were excluded form 
the  survey),  in  111  there  is  an  ethics  committee 
and  of  4  medical  faculties  in  Croatia  3  of  them 
have an ethics committee. There is also an ethics 
committee at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine 
in  Zagreb  and  Faculty  of  Pharmacy  and 
Biochemistry  in  Zagreb,  an  ethical  committee  at 
the  Institute  for  Anthropology,  Institute  for

ethics  committees  in  the  healthcare  institutions, 
89%  of  ethics  committees  have  5  members  as 
required  by  the  Law  on  the  Health  Protection 
from  1997,  2  did  not  state  the  number  of  their

members.  All  committees  have  physicians  as 
members,  and  34  committees  have  a  nurse 
member.  Only  one  committee  had  a  philosopher 
member.  Other  professions  that  were  mentioned 
as members of the committees were: 1 biologist, 
6  pharmacists,  1  musician,  3  biochemists,  
5  psychologists,  1  biotechnologist,  3  social

2  theologians,  1  sociologist,  4  lawyers).    Only 
two  healthcare  institutions  mentioned  that  they 
also  have  a  secretary  and  a  vice-president  in  the 
committee (in the first case vice-president of the 
committee  was 
lawyer  was 
secretary,  in  the  second  case  vice-president  was 
theologian and secretary a physician).  The ethics 
committees  at  medical  faculties  have  from  5  to 
10 members and majority of them are physicians. 
In  2  of  3  committees  at  medical  faculties  there 
are  members  who  are  not  physicians.  In  one  of 
them,  there  is  a  member  who  is  an  expert  in 
political sciences and in the other one, there is a 
research

institutes  and  the  faculty  of  veterinary  medicine 
and  faculty  of  pharmacy  were  almost  all  either 
from 
fields  of  medical,  biological  or 
veterinary  sciences  or  pharmacy  and  only  one 
member  was  a  lawyer.  They  all  had  between  4 
and  7  members.  The  same  can  be  said  for  the 
ethics  committees  in  professional  associations.

From  the  healthcare  institutions  involved  in  this 
research  there  were  only  18  standing  orders  or 
regulations  for  the  conduct  of  meetings  (decree, 
by-laws...). Only in 3 cases of the standing order 
specific international documents and declarations 
were 
(Helsinki  Declaration,  Tokyo 
Declaration,  Good  Clinical  Practice  guidelines). 
Other  documents  that  were  cited  were:  Code  of 
ethics  of  the  Croatian  Medical  Association  (1), 
Law on the protection of mentally ill (1), Law on 
the  healthcare  protection  (3),  Law  on  the  health 
insurance  (1).    From  the  other  institutions  that 
were  also  involved  in  this  survey  additional  3 
standing  orders  and  1  ethical  code  have  been 
mentioned. 

About  the  other  committees  present  in  the 
healthcare  institutions,  in  19  institutions  there  is

In preparing these opinions NBCM will naturally 
use  the  already  existing  documents  prepared  by 
various national and international institutions and 
bodies.  NBCM  follows  carefully  the  events  on 
the 
international  ethics  scene.  The  various 
sometimes  contradictory  and  opposite  opinions 
concerning research of CoE, EU and UK Medical 
Research council on organs, embryos, germ cells 
cause problems for dealing with ethical issues for 
Croatia  but  also  for  other  small  countries.  The 
same is true for obvious inadequate collaboration 
between  various  ethical  bodies  sometimes  even 
in  the  same  organization  (EU  Forum  of  NEC’s, 
in 
EGE).  Smaller  countries  starting  work 
defining and legally solving various ethical issues 
could  benefit  in  better  collaboration  and  greater 
similarity  of  opinions  about  common  ethical 
problems  which  are  present  in  practically  all 
countries  not  only  in  Europe.  But  Croatia  as  a 
candidate  for  EU  is  primarily  interested  in 
European 
sometimes 
unacceptably different.

are 

In conclusion, one can say that ethics is more and 
more  important  in  the  everyday  life  of  the 
Croatian  citizen.  There  is  only  one  bioethics 
committee in Croatia, that for medicine. It would, 
naturally be more appropriate to have a National 
committee  which  is  broader  covering  all  human 
activities  not  just  medicine.  However  a  vast 
majority of ethical problems everywhere, also in 
Croatia,  have  more  or  less  direct  link  with 
medicine and biomedical research.

THE GERMAN NATIONAL ETHICS COUNCIL 

Function 

Following  the  German  Federal  Government’s 
decision  of  2  May  2001  the  National  Ethics 
Council  was  established  on  8  June  2001  as  a 
national  forum  for  dialogue  about  ethical  issues 
in  the  life  sciences.  It  provides  an  umbrella  for 
interdisciplinary  discourse  relating  to  science, 
medicine,  theology,  philosophy  and  the  social 
and  legal  sciences,  expressing  its  views  on  both 
the  ethical  aspects  of  new  developments  in  the 
life sciences and their impact on individuals and 
society  as  a  whole.  The  National  Ethics  Council 
consists of up to 25 Members who represent the 
fields of science, medicine, theology, philosophy, 
society,  law,  ecology  and  economy,  and  are 
appointed by the Federal Chancellor for a period 
of  four  years.  The  Members  generally  convene 
once a month in Berlin. 

The  National  Ethics  Council  is  an  independent 
body,  bound only by  its purpose  as  stipulated  in 
the  Government  decision  that  established  it.  It 
determines the scope and organisation of its work 
independently. 

The  Ethics  Council  puts  great  emphasis  on  its 
work  with 
its 
opinions, recommendations and reports public. 

the  community  and  makes 

The  National  Ethics  Council  cooperates  with 
other  ethics  bodies  in  Germany  as  well  as  with 
comparable  institutions  of  other  countries  and 
international organisations. 

The  General  Secretariat  of  the  National  Ethics 
Council  is  located  on  the  premises  of  the  Berlin 
Brandenburg  Academy 
and 
its  General 
Humanities.  The  Council  and 
Secretariat  are  funded  by  the  German  Federal 
Government.

Genetic diagnosis before and during pregnancy 
(2003-01-23) 

A.  The  temporary  import  of  pluripotent  human 
stem  cells  is  deemed  ethically  acceptable 
under strict conditions (described in detail in 
the Opinion), as the production of such stem 
cells  using  surplus  embryos  is  held  to  be 
ethically 
the 
production  of  such  stem  cells  using  surplus 
embryos  within  Germany  would  also  be 
acceptable. The import conditions mentioned 
would  have  to  apply  in  equal  measure  to 
both publicly and privately funded research. 

permissible. 

Therefore, 

B.  The  Council  advocates  the  provisional  and 
temporary import of human embryonic stem 
cells  under  strict  conditions  as  described  in 
the  Opinion.  All  conditions  shall  apply  in 
equal measure to both publicly and privately 
funded  research,  and  must  be  met  prior  to 
import. 

C.  A  provisional  ban  (moratorium)  should  be 
imposed  on  stem  cell  import.  The  legislator 
must  arrive  at  an  explicit  decision  on 
imports,  yet  not  before  clarifying  a  number 
of  issues,  individually  listed  in  the  Opinion. 
These issues  should be examined before the 
end of 2004. 

D.  Stem  cell 

import 

is  deemed  ethically 
impermissible,  mainly  due  to  the  basic 
considerations surrounding the production of 
stem  cells  using  human  embryos.  As  this  is 
deemed an impermissible instrumentalisation 
(destruction)  of  human  life,  it  follows  that 
the  import  of  such  stem  cells  must  be 
rejected. The imported cells carry the stigma 
of  the  conditions  under  which  they  were 
produced.  Their  import  will  lead  to  an 
increase 
thereby  directly 
promoting  consumption  of  embryos  in  the 
exporting  countries.  Eventually  the  level  of 
protection  afforded  to  embryos  will  be 
lowered also in Germany. 

in  demand, 

Bearing in mind that the National Ethics Council 
is  yet  to  express  its  opinions  on  the  basic  issues 
surrounding  stem  cell  research,  and  while 
decisions regarding the import of embryonic stem 
cells  are  still  pending,  fifteen  Members  have 
moved in favour of a tightly restricted temporary 
import of embryonic stem cells (Option B). Nine 
among  these  fifteen  also  advocated  Option  A. 
Ten  Members  favour  a  moratorium  on  stem  cell 
imports  for  the  time  being  (Option  C),  among 
these four who are also in favour of Option D. 

Germany's National Ethics Council unanimously 
recommends  regulating 
the  use  of  prenatal 
diagnosis  (PND)  and  pre-implantation  genetic 
diagnosis  (PGD)  in  a  special  comprehensive 
reproductive medicine law.  
The  Council's  24  members  once  again  urge  an 
open  discussion  of  the  ethical,  legal  and  social 
issues  arising  from  advances  being  made  in 
medicine  and  the  life  sciences,  a  discussion  that 
acknowledges  existing  differences  of  opinion. 
The  Council  points  out  that  mutual  respect  is  a 
prerequisite  for  reaching  a  convincing  political 
solution to the conflicts that have come to light in 
the  course  of  this  discussion.  Furthermore,  this 
particularly  calls  for  a  willingness  to  respect 
differing opinions and to examine the arguments 
behind  these  opinions  equally  conscientiously 
and objectively. 
As  already  stated  in  its  first  Opinion  on  the 
import of human embryonic stem cells, issued in 
December  2001,  the  National  Ethics  Council 
consequently does not consider it to be its task to 
embrace  a  particular  regulatory  arrangement  or 
indeed 
to 
lawmakers as ultimately the only possible option.  
The Council's job is rather to develop arguments 
and  point  out  possible  solutions  connected  with 
these  arguments.  It  must  be  left  to  parliament  to 
choose the legislative path that, in its view and in 
cognizance of these arguments, is appropriate. 
the  Opinion 
Based  on 
this  understanding, 
presents  and  discusses  what  are,  from 
the 
Council's perspective, the two possible responses 
to  pre-implantation  genetic  diagnosis,  namely, 
strict  rejection  or  allowing  PGD  only  as  an 
exception when stringent requirements have been 
met.  As  part  of 
regulatory 
the  Opinion  also 
arrangements 
highlights various approaches that could be taken 
and, in doing so, further broadens the scope of its 
critical analysis. 
The Council's members have therefore decided to 
dispense  with  a  vote  and  have  confined 
themselves 
their  own 
to 
position by signing the approaches they support. 
With  the  Opinion  issued  today,  the  Council 
presents a document that:

Biobanks for research (2004-03-17)

important 

The  National  Ethics  Council  has  examined  the 
scientific  status  of  biobanks  by  reference  to 
concrete  examples,  established  ethical  principles 
for their evaluation, put forward a framework of 
legal  conditions  to  govern  their  operation,  and 
formulated  conclusions  on  how  they  should  be 
regulated.    The  Opinion  is  preceded  by  30 
regulatory proposals. 
For  the  purposes  of  this  Opinion,  biobanks  are 
defined  as  collections  of  specimens  of  human 
bodily  substances  associated  or  associable  with 
personal  data  and  information  on  their  donors.  
The  Opinion  deals  exclusively  with  biobanks 
intended for medical research. 
Biobanks  are  an 
for 
identifying the causes and mechanisms of a large 
number of diseases, and in that respect could lead 
to  significant  breakthroughs  in  medical  and 
pharmaceutical  research.    However,  they  also 
arouse anxiety and distrust.  The main concern is

uncontrolled use of specimens and data, together 
with the possibility that potential donors might be 
pressurized  into  assuming  unreasonable  risks  or 
imprudently divulging personal information. 
The  National  Ethics  Council  therefore  considers 
it essential for explicit information to be given to 
those  concerned  and  regards  their  consent  as 
being  of  central  importance.    At  the  same  time 
the Ethics Council is aware that the full scientific 
potential  of  biobank  specimens  and  data  can 
often  be  exploited  only  if  their  use  is  not 
restricted  to  individual,  predetermined  research 
projects.  For this reason, it must be also possible 
for  donors  to  consent  to  the  use  of  their 
specimens  and  data  for  medical  research  in 
general and for an indefinite period.  The risks to 
donors  presented  by  the  greater  flexibility  thus 
afforded to research must, however, be offset by 
a legal requirement of confidentiality on the part 
of the researchers.

The  problems  and  issues  raised  by  biobanks  are 
outlined  in  a  joint  declaration  by  the  National 
Ethics  Councils  of  Germany  and  France  
(2003-10-02).  
The  large-scale  collection  and  comparison  of 
body  materials  and  the  data  derived  from  them 
make  it  possible  to  establish  correlations  that 
may in the long term yield a valuable diagnostic 
and  therapeutic  return.  However,  there  is  a  risk 
that the data and samples could be used for  

 18

purposes other than those to which the donor has 
consented or be passed on to third parties.  
The following aspects are of paramount 
importance in the regulation of biobanks:  

•  the  existence  of  a  guaranteed  continuous 
"chain  of  responsibility"  in  relation  to  the 
derivation,  storage,  handling  and  use  of 
body materials and personal data;  

•  a  clear  definition  of  the  donor’s  free  and 

informed consent; and  

•  issues of solidarity, altruism and justice.

THE HELLENIC NATIONAL 
BIOETHICS COMMISSION 

A. Second mandate of the Commission 

The Commission was formed in 1999 and its first 
mandate  expired  on  25  February  2004.    The 
second  mandate  is  already  appointed  by  the 
Prime  Minister  by  his  decision  Y  50/9.2.2004.  
Following  this  new  appointment,  the  member  
Mr. Ionannis Manoledakis, has been replaced by 
Mr. Pavolos Sourlas, Professor of Philosophy and 
Methodology of Law, Law School, University of 
Athens,  new  member  of  the  Commission  ever 
since. 

B. Post-graduate students  

Two  post-graduate  students  were  successively 
admitted  by  the  Commission  in  order  to  prepare 
their  diploma  (the  first  one  for  the  University 
Paris  XII  Val  de  Marne  –  Faculté  de  Droit  de 
Saint-Maur and the second on for the University 
Sorbonne de Paris 1) for a short period of time. 

C. Recommendations already published 

The  Commission  has  recently  published  two 
recommendations, whose abstracts follow. 

1.  Recommendations on “Patent in 
biotechnology” 
Abstract 
The  term  biotechnology  refers  to  a  combination 
of  science  and  technology  with  a  view  to 
exploiting  applications  arising  from  the  study  of 
biological  systems  or  elements  thereof.    The 
Commission recognizes that the vast majority of 
structural elements that make up any organism on 
the biological processes that keep it alive cannot 
be  artificially  reproduced  without  using  natural 
biological  processes,  such  as  reproduction  or 
growth,  and  therefore,  human  inventiveness  in 
biotechnology  is  limited  to  skilful  manipulation 
and  modification  of  organisms  or  elements 
thereof.  
The Commission considers that the description or 
isolation  of  biological  systems  or  elements 
thereof  involving  morphological,  structural  or 
functional  characteristics  cannot  be  patented.  
This  principle  emanates  directly 
the 
distinction  between 
invention  and  discovery 
adopted by the system of patents and recognizes 
that 
to  Directive 
98/44/EC, particularly articles 3 (2) and 4 (2) of 
p.d.  321/2001  transposing  the  directive  into 
national law. 

this  position 

is  counter 

from 

 19

far  as  methods 

The Commission believes that biological systems 
or  elements  thereof  may  be  patented  if  not 
in  nature.  Therefore,  modified 
occurring 
biological  systems  like  transgenic  organisms  or 
parts 
lines, 
thereof  such  as  modified  cell 
including  human  ones,  may  in  principle  be 
patented. 
As 
in  biotechnology  are 
concerned, the Commission adopts the view that 
a  novel  method  is  by  definition  an  “invention” 
regardless of whether its product or object is life.  
Therefore,  biotechnology  methods  in  themselves 
are  patentable  though  the  patent  may  not  extend 
to their products. 
The  Commission  recommends  that  claims  for 
patents  on  biotechnology  products  or  methods 
must  specify  accurately  the  product  or  method 
they refer to.  Claims to extend a patent “mutatis 
mutandis” to other products or methods are to be 
rejected  both  for  reasons  related  to  safety  of 
transactions (avoiding overlapping rights of more 
than one rightholders) as  well as to avoid undue 
restrictions of freedom of research by “isolating” 
and  granting  exclusive  exploitation  rights  on 
wider areas of knowledge. 
Finally, the Commission is in favour of adopting 
a  system  of  mandatory  licenses  granted  to  third 
parties  by  the  responsible  public  authorities  for 
patented  biotechnology  applications  in  order  to 
avoid  restrictions  to  scientific  research,  and 
alleviate the developing countries from excessive 
economic burdens. 

2.  Recommendations on “the use of animals in 
research” (5.03.2004) 
Abstract 

The  Commission  notes  that  our  civilization 
ascribes  moral  significance 
to  animals  and 
therefore  accepts  certain  responsibilities  and 
duties towards them.  The Commission considers 
that  this  does  not  assign  the  status  of  a  moral 
agent  to  animals,  and  therefore  adopts  the  view 
that it is morally acceptable for human beings to 
use animals in research but it is morally wrong to 
cause  them  unnecessary  or  avoidable  suffering.  
The  Commission  recognizes  that  there  is  a 
continued  need  for  animal  experiments  both  in 
basic  and  applied  research  and  stresses  that  the 
legal framework in Greece is adequate and in line 
with international and EU law. 

The  Commission  eagerly  supports  the  principles 
of Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement and 
underlines 
further 
dissemination  of  these  principles  by  the  relevant 
academic and research institutions.  In particular,  

is  need

for 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Commission urges for the formal inclusion of 
animal  bioethics  in  the  curriculum  of  university 
degrees in the domain of life sciences. 
The  Commission  affirms  the  need  for  effective 
the 
inspection  mechanism  and  recommends 
elaboration  and  adoption  of  a  system, 
in 
international  standards  and 
accordance  with 
guidelines,  which  will  provide  accreditation  to 
researchers  and the establishments where animal 
research  is  taking  place.    The  Commission 
believes that such a system would ensure animal 
welfare,  protect  researchers  and  promote  the 
credibility of research in Greece. 

D. Recommendation in preparation 

The  Commission 
is  currently  elaborating  a 
recommendation on “biomedical experimentation 
on  human  beings  and  the  clinical  trials  on 
medicinal  products  for  human  use”. 
  The 
recommendation  is  expected  to  be  published  by 
the end of April 2004.

THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ETHICS 
COMMITTEE (CEST) 
QUÉBEC, CANADA 

•  PUBLICATIONS   

Opinion Statement on GMOs.  In December 
2003,  the  Committee  published  a  statement 
entitled  For  the  Ethical  Management  of  GMOs. 
The statement examined the ethical issues raised 
by  the  genetic  modification  of  microorganisms, 
plants,  and  animals.  Building  on  a  fundamental 
distinction  between 
the  process  of  genetic 
modification  and  the  products  that  result,  the 
Committee  not  only  looked  at  the  risks  and 
concerns  associated  with  GM  products,  but  also 
the  human  and  social  impacts  linked  to  the 
process  of  transgenesis.  In  its  ethical  evaluation 
of  genetically  modified  products,  the  Committee 
considered  the  following  values:  human  health, 
the environment, the economy, and public trust in 
the  government  organizations  responsible  for 
managing  GMO  issues.  In  its  ethical  evaluation 
of  the  process,  CEST  focused  on  the  quality  of 
community 
in  a  pluralistic  and  democratic 
society,  which  led  it  to  reflect  on  the  impact  of 
GMOs  on  local  and  international  agricultural 
production, cultural and spiritual representations, 
and  the  public’s  ability  to  exercise  freedom  of 
choice and contribute to decision making. 

to 

is  devoted 

The  Committee’s  statement  is  divided  into  five 
the   
chapters,  one  of  which 
approach  used  for  an  ethical  evaluation.  CEST 
formulated nine recommendations calling, among 
other things, for labeling of genetically modified 
traceability 
implementation  of  a 
products, 
system,  and  a  public  debate  on  GMOs.  It  also 
issued  four  cautionary  notes  to  public  and 
institutional  decision  makers.  The  statement  and 
additional  documents  are  available  in  French  on 
the CEST Website, as is a statement summary in 
English, French, and Spanish.    

Memorandum to the Quebec 
parliamentary committee on new issues in 
food safety.  In February 2004, CEST tabled a 
memorandum with the parliamentary committee 
based on the sections of its GMO report dealing 
with food safety. The document is available in 
French on the CEST Website. 

Brochure on genetic databases.  In a follow 
up to its opinion statement on The Ethical Issues 
of  Genetic  Databases:  Towards  Democratic  and

 CURRENT PROJECTS 

Opinion statement on organ donations and 
transplants.    Work  on  this  statement  began  in 
2003 and a working committee has been set up to 
oversee  the  project.  With  organs  for  transplants 
in short supply, CEST is looking at ethical issues 
surrounding  strategies  to  alleviate  the  shortage. 
The  opinion  statement  should  be  published  in 
December  2004.  The  mandate  and  a  list  of  the 
members of the working committee are available 
on the CEST Website. 

Consultations on the topic: 
In  preparing  its  statement,  CEST  is  conducting 
two  types  of  consultations  in  May  2004.  The 
first,  a  consultation  of  groups  across  Québec,  is 
expected  to  draw  over  100  stakeholders  and 
specialists  involved  with  organ  donations  and 
transplants.  The  second,  an  online  consultation 
via  the  CEST  Website,  will  be  open  to  the 
general  public.  A  consultation  paper  is  available 
in French and in English on the CEST Website.  

Issues  Paper  on  the  use  of  biometric  data 
for  national  and  international  security 
purposes.    This  CEST  paper  is  in  response  to 
global terrorism and to U.S. pressure on national 
governments  to  equip  themselves  with  new 
border  surveillance  technology.  All  around  the 
world,  new  measures  are  being  taken  to  identify 
and 
individuals,  often  using 
technology based on biometric data (fingerprints, 
iris  scans,  DNA,  etc.).  What  does  this  mean  for 
the  protection  of  privacy 
and  personal 
information?  Is  there  a  danger  of  marginalizing 
certain groups? Are we at a point where the end 
may  justify  the  means?  CEST  will  publish  an 
issues paper on the topic in fall 2004, potentially 
followed by an opinion statement in 2005.

Studies on nanosciences and 
neurosciences.  CEST has begun two studies on 
developments in these disciplines to determine to 
which extent they can be considered together in 
the healthcare and, possibly, the military fields. 
The studies are scheduled for release in March 
2005 and could potentially be followed by a 
CEST opinion statement in March 2006. 

•  SPECIAL  ACTIVITIES  

Ethics Day.  CEST held its first Ethics Day on 
June  8,  2004.  The  program  for  the  day  was  to 
provide researchers and Grade 10 and 11 students 
(aged 15 to 17) and their teachers an opportunity 
to discuss issues related to genetic information. It 
also  gave  CEST  an  opportunity  to  publicize  its 
work  and  draw  attention  to  the  importance  of 
reflecting  on  the  ethics  of  developments  and 
applications in science and technology. 

Government  Website  on  GMO  foods 
(ethical  aspect).    The  Québec  government  has 
asked CEST and others partners to help develop a 
government  Website  on  GMOs  scheduled  to  go 
online in June 2004. CEST is responsible for the 
ethics  component  of  the  site,  and  has  also  been 
given  the  task  of    ensuring  that  site  content  is 
relevant, neutral, and objective. 

Science  et  société  international  forum. 
CEST is one of the partners involved in preparing 
the  fifth  edition  of  this  international  event  that 
brings  together  researchers  and  college  and  high 
school  students  aged  17  to  20.  Held  in  late 
November,  the  Forum  features  lectures  and 
workshops  promoting  science  and  technology 
and  addressing  its  role  in  our  future.  CEST  will 
help  ensure  that  the  event  also  has  an  ethical 
focus.

CURRENT WORK 

The ethics of research involving animals 

Many  people  are  concerned  about  the  use  of 
animals  in  research.  There  is  also  widespread 
the  need  for  more  medical 
recognition  of 
research.  Since  much  of  this  currently  involves 
the use of animals, these two views are not easily 
reconciled.  The  Nuffield  Council  on  Bioethics, 
recognising  that  people  feel  very  deeply  about 
this topic, has set up a Working Party to consider 
the  ethical  issues  raised  by  research  involving 
animals.  The  Working  Party  has  now  met  seven 
times,  and  held  a  number  of  fact-finding 
meetings.    A  public  consultation  exercise  was 
held during the Autumn of 2003; more than 160 
responses  were  received  from  a  wide  variety  of 
individuals  and  organisations.  A 
interested 
Report  is  scheduled  to  be  published  in  spring 
2005.

In April 2002, the Council published a Report on 
the  ethics  of  research  related  to  healthcare  in 
developing  countries.  A  follow-up  Workshop 
was  held  in  Cape  Town  in  February  2004,  to 
consider  developments  since  the  publication  of 
the  Report.  Fifty  eight  delegates  from  28 
countries  attended  the  meeting  and  the  mix  of 
delegates,  with  diverse  backgrounds  and  a  wide 
range  of  experiences,  facilitated  very  valuable 
discussion. The meeting provided the opportunity 
to  consider  how  guidance  is  implemented  in 
practice, and difficulties that may be encountered 
when  guidelines  are  conflicting.  A  follow-up 
paper  will  be  produced  based  on  discussions  in 
the meeting.

A closed Workshop will be held in July 2004, 
with  the  main  focus  to  consider  the  tensions 
between  individual  choice  and  community 
benefit.  The  Council  discussed  this  issue  at  a 
bi-lateral  meeting  with  the  French  CCNE  in 
November 2003, and it will be on the agenda 
for  a  meeting  with  members  of  the  German 
Der Nationale Ethikrat in July 2004. 

RECENT PUBLICATION 

The use of genetically modified crops in 
developing countries  

The  Council  provoked  considerable  discussion 
with  the  publication  of  its  Report,  Genetically 
modified crops: ethical and social issues in 1999. 
Four years on, the Council decided to produce a 
follow-up Discussion Paper, focusing specifically 
on the use of genetically modified (GM) crops in 
countries.  The  perspective  of 
developing 
developing  countries  is  often  neglected  from 
discussions in the UK. The Discussion Paper was 
published in December 2003.

Agriculture  has  a  crucial  role 
in 
developing countries, as a source of food, income 
and employment. This Discussion Paper reviews

The  Paper  concludes  that  the  possible  costs, 
benefits  and  risks  associated  with  particular  GM 
crops must be assessed on a case by case basis. In 
appropriate  circumstances,  GM  crops  can  have 
considerable  potential 
tackling  specific 
agricultural  problems,  such  as  drought  and  salty 
soils.  There  is  therefore  an  ethical  obligation  to 
explore  the  benefits  that  GM  crops  could  offer 
in  developing  countries.  The  Paper

KEY INSIGHTS: A GLIMPSE INTO THE OPINION 

The  advent  of  new  genome  editing  technologies  such  as  CRISPR/CasX  has 
opened  new  dimensions  of  what  and  how  genetic  interventions  into  our 
world  are  possible.  This  Opinion  addresses  the  profound  ethical  questions 
raised  and  revived  by  them.  It  analyses  various  domains  of  application, 
from  human  health  to  animal  experimentation,  from  livestock  breeding  to 
crop variety and to gene drives. With its wide view across areas, it identifies 
underlying  and  overarching  issues  that  deserve  our  concerted  attention, 
among  them,  the  different  meanings  that  ought  to  be  attributed  to 
humanness, naturalness or diversity. This enables conclusions that provide 
panoramic perspectives complementing narrower, area-specific analyses. In 
the  same  vein,  the  Opinion  is  concerned  with  the  global  dimension  of 
genome  editing and its regulation and formulates recommendations  with a 
particular 
Its  main  overarching 
focus  on 
considerations are the following:  

international 

level. 

the 

  How the human ability to edit the genome should be regulated is closely 
linked  to  questions  about  the  status  of  humanity  in  ‘nature’.  Are  we  its 
masters  with  a  right  to  transform  it,  or  are  we  one  of  many  parts  of  it 
that  all  thrive  in  relation  to  each  other?  Does  our  growing  knowledge 
about  it  postulate  that  we  care  for  it  and  protect  it  where  we  can? 
Awareness  of  one-sided  positions,  such  as  anthropocentrism  and 
speciesism,  can  help  us  to  engage  in  the  debate  about  genome  editing 
on the basis of the values of diversity, respect and responsibility. 

  The  application  of  genome  editing  in  human  and  non-human  animals 
raises  questions  about  what  defines  us  as  humans  and  what 
distinguishes  species  from  each  other.  Our  genome  is  often  taken  as 
foundational  of  our  humanness,  providing  us  with  distinct  capacities. 
Should  we,  or  should  we  rather  not,  experiment  with  the  delineations 
defining and distinguishing species? What risks and responsibilities would 
this  entail?  On  the  other  hand,  genetic  exceptionalism  and  determinism 
(the idea that the genome plays the  central role in shaping who we are 
and  determines  our  behaviour)  can  prevent  us  from  taking  a  more 
holistic perspective on the many factors defining us and our lives, as well 
as other species and theirs. Awareness of this can help us to put genome 
editing and discourses about it into perspective. 

  Diversity,  human  diversity  and  overall  biodiversity,  can  be  impacted  by 
genome  editing  in  different  ways.  The  technology  may  both  offer 
possibilities to preserve and diversify biospheres, and come with risks of 
reducing  genetic  pools  and,  hence,  diversity  –  both  in  biological  terms 
and  in  terms  of  what  kind  of  diversity  is  socially  appreciated.  This 
requires us to reflect about the responsibilities of humans towards other 
species  and  the  planet,  most  importantly  as  regards  anthropogenic 
climate  change;  as  well  as  towards  other  humans,  as  regards 

4

determining  what  kinds  of  persons  a  society  might  want  to  have  and 
what specific variations are,  or  are not, a problem in need of a genetic, 
technological  ‘solution’.  When  thinking  about  diversity  and  genome 
editing,  we  therefore  also  need  to  think  about  freedom,  autonomy  and 
risks of oppression and marginalisation. 

  The focus on the broader picture of this Opinion also raises awareness of 
the  risk  that  genome  editing  could  be  hailed  as  a  technological  solution 
for issues of social nature. An approach that does not consider the ethics 
and governance of genome  editing in a technology-specific way  enables 
us  to  pinpoint  the  broader  societal  questions  in  the  realm  of  which 
technologies,  or  socio-technical  systems,  can  have  an  impact.  What 
world  do  we  want  to  live  in  and  what  role  can  technologies  play  in 
making it reality? 

  Debates  about  genome  editing  often  focus  on  the  question  about  the 
conditions that would render it ‘safe enough’ for application. This Opinion 
draws attention to the importance of nuancing and resisting this framing, 
as  it  purports  that  it  is  enough  for  a  given  overall  level  of  safety  to  be 
reached  in  order  for  a  technology  to  be  rolled  out  unhindered,  and  it 
limits  reflections  on  ethics  and  governance  to  considerations  about 
safety.  Much  to  the  contrary,  ethics  should  serve  to  tackle  broad 
governance  questions  about  how  technologies  can  serve  our  common 
goals and values, and not be limited to providing a ‘last step’ of ‘ethics-
clearing’ of a technology. Safety, if to be a safe concept, must be framed 
in  its  broadest  sense,  including  psychological,  social  and  environmental 
dimensions,  as  well  as  questions  about  who  gets  to  decide  what  is  safe 
enough, and by which processes. 

  With  the increasing  adoption  of  genome  editing,  claims  were  made  that 
scientists were not only able to ‘read’ the ‘Book of Life’, but also to ‘write’ 
it and ‘edit’ it. Any words that are  chosen to describe a new technology 
have an impact on the discourse about it. They shape how we perceive it 
and engage in debates about it, they frame what questions scholars ask 
about it and investigate, they influence how policy makers respond to it. 
Awareness  of  this  can  help  us  to  find  terms  that  appropriately  capture 
and  transmit  the  complexity  of  new  genome  editing  applications  and  of 
the ethical questions they raise. 

The  Opinion  begins  with  an  overarching  chapter  assessing  the  preceding 
points  and  continues  with  detailed  ethical  analyses  of  pertaining  questions 
in  the  main  areas  of  application  of  genome  editing.  Some  of  the  key 
reflections of those chapters are the following:

Genome editing in humans 

If the genome of one human being can be submitted to deliberate, targeted 
editing  by  another  human  being,  what  implications  does  this  have  for  the 
relationship  between  the  two  persons?  Would  this  undermine  the 
fundamental equality of all human beings, or is it necessary to assume the 
responsibility of such an intervention when it can help to prevent a serious 
disease?  In this context, we  often distinguish between therapy, prevention 
and  enhancement,  as  different  purposes  that  genome  editing  can  serve, 
with  the  use  of  genome  editing  for  purposes  of  therapy  or  prevention  of 
disease  being  by  many  considered  far  more  acceptable  than  the  use  for 
enhancement purposes. 

While somatic genome editing therapies have been developed for decades, 
there  appears  to  be  general  agreement  that  germline  genome  editing, 
hence  introducing  heritable  changes,  is  not  to  be  applied  at  this  point.  In 
many  fora  have  its  potentially  severe  risks  –  for  the  individuals  concerned 
and  for  society  overall  –  been  discussed.  Together  with  the  difficulty  to 
conduct  long-term  studies  and  the  availability  of  alternative  methods  for 
avoiding  heritable  disorders,  they  require  us  to  ask:  Are  research  on 
embryos and the risk of harm caused by the technology ethically acceptable 
and  proportionate  for  the  few  cases  for  which  there  is  no  alternative 
solution?  Questions  like  these  require  broad  and  well-informed  societal 
deliberation  on  the  basis  of  an  awareness  about  how  heritable  genome 
editing may result in major changes of a society overall, its composition and 
its values. 

Genome editing in animals 

Animals can be considered by humans as having an intrinsic value in their 
own  right,  or  they  can  be  considered  in  their  instrumental  value  for 
humans.  Against  this  background,  genome  editing  revives  old  questions 
about  inter-species  relationships  and  relational  values.  In  what  is  the 
intrinsic value of non-human animals different from that of human animals? 
How  do  we  define  respect  for  non-human  animals  and  what  rights  do  we 
attribute to them?  

In  human  health  research,  genome  editing  might  on  the  one  hand  offer 
opportunities to replace animal experimentation with alternative laboratory 
methods;  on  the  other  hand,  the  mere  ease  of  creating  genome  edited 
animals  with  the  precise  genetic  traits  useful  for  a  given  research  purpose 
could  also  lead  to  an  increase  in  their  use.  Genome  editing  in  research 
animals  moreover  raises  questions  about  animal  welfare,  for  example  if

traits  leading  to  disease  are  introduced;  about  de-animalisation,  if  traits 
that are natural for a species are knocked out; about humanisation, if non-
human primates (or other animals) are genetically changed in a way so that 
they  resemble  humans  more  than  they  would  naturally  do;  and  about 
justice  if  the  technology  would  serve  exclusive  scientific  and  commercial 
health services, for example in the context of xenotransplantation. 

In farm animals, genome  editing applications largely serve the same  goals 
as  selective  breeding  practices,  namely,  to  increase  yields,  strengthen 
disease  resistance  and  improve  product  quality.  Ethical  considerations  in 
this  context  relate  to  animal  welfare,  biodiversity,  sustainability  and  the 
necessity of an unbiased public dialogue. Genome editing has the potential 
to  facilitate  or  exacerbate  commercial  practices  in  livestock  breeding  that 
are already highly contested. 

Genome editing in plants 

Current  forms  of  agriculture  contribute  significantly  to  the  anthropogenic 
climate  crisis.  There  is  a  need  to  ensure  food  security,  provide  renewable 
resources  for  fuel,  feed  and  fibre,  safeguard  the  retention  of  biodiversity 
and  protect  the  environment.  Genome  editing  technologies  could,  with 
appropriate and proportionate control, enhance our ability to achieve these 
goals, just as they could result in the opposite without it. 

Social  and  justice  considerations  play  a  role  in  this  too.  The  economic 
impact  of  choosing  to  use  or  not  use  plants  produced  with  new  genome 
editing technologies may be significant and public authorities should ensure 
that  society  overall  benefits.  This  includes  that  small  farmers  and  holistic 
approaches to production are supported; that new varieties will not result in 
greater 
increased  unemployment  and 
precariousness  in  agriculture;  that  the  ability  of  small  companies  and 
research  organisations  to  produce  new  varieties  is  strengthened  and 
monopolisation of the production of seed restrained and prevented. 

industrialisation

In  Europe,  genetically  modified  food  is  contested  in  large  parts  of  society. 
This  can  be  attributed,  in  parts,  to  mistakes  made  in  the  past  in  not 
involving  the  public  in  choosing  what  was  introduced  onto  the  market,  as 
well  as  a  lack  of  safeguards  preventing  false  information  or  hype  provided 
by all sides in the debate.

Gene drives 

Gene drives are a specific use of genome editing that has drawn particular 
attention  as  it  offers  the  possibility  to  guide  ‘biased’  inheritance  of  certain 
genes  into  entire  animal  or  insect  populations,  for  example  pests  or 
mosquitos,  usually  with  the  aim  to  make  them  harmless  or  more 
vulnerable.  This  raises  a  number  of  ethical  concerns  that  have  been 
discussed  in  various  fora.  Among  them  are  also  important  concerns  about 
global  and  epistemic  justice,  as  well  as  anthropocentrism:  If  one  day 
applied,  how  can  we  ensure  that  those  populations  that  need  it  the  most 
have  access  to  the  technology?  How  can  we  ensure  that  we  solve  those 
scientific  questions  that  address  the  alleviation  of  the  greatest  suffering? 
Given the increasing recognition that animals and plants and our ecosystem 
as a whole should not only be protected for the sake of human health and 
wellbeing, but also in their own right, how can we ensure that the interests 
of all species are considered in regulation and governance decisions?  

There is a clear need for collective, inclusive, democratically legitimate ways 
to decide  what new genome editing techniques  should be used for in each 
area, as well as how such responsible use should be safely regulated.

1  INTRODUCTION  

Ethics of Genome Editing 

The  possibility  of  intervening  in  the  genome  in  order  to  change  the 
molecular structure or the function of a gene has  reached new dimensions 
with  the  development  of  technologies1  that  can  change  genetic  and 
epigenetic  features  in  a  targeted  way.  These  rapidly  evolving  technologies 
can in principle be applied to every living organism – be it a microorganism, 
a  plant,  an  animal  or  a  human  being.  There  are  several  aspects  that 
distinguish  them  from  previous  technologies:  in  comparison  with  earlier 
methods  to  change  a  gene,  what  is  now  called  genome  editing  is  more 
precise  and  effective  and  can  sometimes  be  carried  out  inexpensively  and 
without  complicated  technical  challenges.  This  opens  up  new  dimensions 
with  regard  to  the  accessibility  and  the  scope  of  application  of  genome 
editing. 

As  with  any  ground-breaking  technology,  high  hopes  are  matched  by  far-
reaching fears. Genome editing comes with promising potentials as well as 
major  risks.  In  the  human  domain,  treatment  or  prevention  of  serious 
diseases,  which  are  as  yet  barely  medically  controllable,  might  become 
possible.2 In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, genome 

1  Early  means  to  genetically  modify  human  cells  used  vector-triggered  random  integration  of 
DNA  into  the  genome  of  somatic  cells,  including  in  clinical  settings.  Targeted  (non-random) 
genetic modification, gene addition, replacement or inactivation was achieved by homologous 
recombination (HR) of engineered DNA, an extremely rare event, which is mostly restricted to 
dividing  cells.  However,  both  technologies  were  used  to  generate  genetically  modified 
organisms,  including  germline  modified  animals  to  generate  transgenic  or  gene  knock-out  or 
knock-in  strains.  The  discovery  that  double  strand  breaks  (DSBs)  increase  the  efficacy  of  HR 
by  orders  of  magnitude,  and  the  availability  of  tools  to  induce  such  DSBs  at  defined  genetic 
locations  allowed  the  targeted  editing  of  genes  at  unprecedented  efficacy.  Increasingly 
effective  and  robust  tools  to  induce  targeted  DSBs  included  zinc  finger  nucleases  (ZFNs) 
(2007), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) (2009), and clustered regularly 
interspaced  short  palindromic  repeat  (CRISPR)-associated  nuclease  9  (Cas9)  (2013).  This 
technological  progress  in  efficacy  and  precision  allows  the  application  of  genome  editing  in 
virtually  all  cells,  dividing  or  non-dividing,  and  led  to  a  growing  number  of  clinical  studies 
(listed  in  Table  2  of  Li  et  al,  2020,  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-019-0089-
y/tables/2).  The  ease,  precision  and  velocity  of  inducing  DSBs  together  with  high  genome 
scanning efficacy specifically characteristic of CRISPR/Cas9 based tools allows the combination 
of  scalable  targeting  of  multiple  genomic  sites  with  a  multitude  of  possible  genetic 
modifications.   
2  Genome editing presents  an  exciting prospect for  treatment  of  numerous  common  and rare 
diseases that are caused by changes in the genetic code. A number of genome editing clinical 
trials  are  currently  ongoing  (e.g.  NIH,  https://commonfund.nih.gov/editing).  The  first  trials 
were launched in the early 1990s in the USA and China, targeting ADA-SCID, a severe immune 
system deficiency, and hemophilia B (Wang et al, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41434-020-
0163-7).  Clinical  trials  have  also  been  taking  place  in  Europe,  targeting,  for  example,

editing  was  used  to  develop  and  scale  up  rapid  tests  for  SARS-CoV-2.  But 
there are also deep concerns that human embryos could become designable 
according to the preferences of parents and scientists.  

et 

al,  2015, 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy).  Yet,  studies  also  indicate  that  gene  therapies 
may entail risks, among them off-target effects that inadvertently alter untargeted sequences 
(e.g. Kosicki et al, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4192).  
In  2012,  the  European  Medicines  Agency  and  the  European  Commission  approved  a  gene 
therapy treatment for the first time: Alipogene tiparvovec, sold under the brand name Glybera, 
was developed to fight lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) and pancreatitis. The treatment was 
estimated to cost $1 million, making it the most expensive drug in the world at the time. Due 
to  its  cost,  together  with  LPLD  being  ‘ultra-rare’,  it  remained  underused  and  was  withdrawn 
from  the  EU  market  after  two  years  (Warner,  2017,  https://www.labiotech.eu/more-
news/uniqure-glybera-marketing-withdrawn/).  In  the  meantime,  other  gene  therapies  have 
been  approved  and  research  involving  genome  editing  in  somatic  tools  is  proceeding  in  a 
seemingly  rapid  pace  (see  e.g.  Ernst,  2020,  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2020.06.022, 
Daley, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03716-9). 
Research  involving  editing  of  the  human  germline,  however,  has  been  much  more 
controversial,  since  such  changes  would  be  rendered  heritable  and  would,  thus,  affect  future 
generations.  Relevant  research  and  clinical  applications  are  restricted  in  many  countries  by 
laws  related  to  research  in  human  embryos  as  well  as  legislation  that  bans  changes  in  the 
human germline. Examples of such legislation in Europe are the Convention for the protection 
of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and 
medicine,  often  referred  to  as  the  Oviedo  Convention  (Council  of  Europe,  1997)  and  the  EU 
Clinical  Trials  Regulation  (Regulation  No.  536/2014).  (For  more  details  on  the  relevant 
international regulatory landscape see e.g. Araki & Ishii, 2014,  https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-
7827-12-108 and Isasi et al., 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2015.18394). 
To date, studies in different animal models have indicated the feasibility of genome editing in 
animals at the zygote stage (e.g. Yoshimi et al, 2014,  https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5240; 
Heo 
al,  2015, 
https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddv425). The potential of the technology to prevent the onset of 
a  genetic  disorder  in  mice  has  been  demonstrated,  for  example,  by  the  studies  of  Wu  et  al. 
(2013, 
(2014, 
https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1254445),  for  cataract  and  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy 
respectively. Furthermore, relevant studies in non-human primates led to the birth of targeted 
genome edited offspring (Niu et al, 2014, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.027; Liu H. et 
al, 
2014, 
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12264-014-1434-8). 
With  regard  to  relevant  research  in  humans,  two  Chinese  studies  (Liang  et  al,  2015,

in genome edited embryos being mosaic, while  a substantial number of ‘off-target’ mutations 
were observed. However, it should be noted that neither of these studies used the most up-to-
date  CRISPR/CasX  methods.  Yet,  another  breakthrough  study  (Ma  et  al,  2017, 
https://doi.org/10.1038/nature23305) described the correction of certain mutations in human 
embryos  with  CRISPR-Cas9,  concluding  that  “[t]he  efficiency,  accuracy  and  safety  of  the 
approach  presented  suggest  that  it  has  potential  to  be  used  for  the  correction  of  heritable 
mutations  in  human  embryos  by complementing  preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis.  However, 
much remains to be considered before clinical applications, including the reproducibility of the 
technique with other heterozygous mutations” (ibid). 
Despite  the  strict  regulations  in  many  countries  and  the  ongoing  debate  on  the  ethical 
implications of germline editing, in November 2018, a Chinese researcher, He Jiankui, stunned 
the  global  scientific  community  by  claiming  to  have  created  the  world’s  first  babies  from 
embryos that were genetically edited to prevent them contracting HIV. Scientists in China and 
worldwide  denounced  this  work  as  a  step  too  far,  with  many  academies  and  professional 
organisations  calling  for  an  urgent  international  effort  to  prevent  scientists  from  creating  any 
more  genome  edited  babies  without  proper  approval  and

Ethics of Genome Editing 

While  the  technology  could  be  used  to  increase  animal  welfare,  genome 
editing can also contribute to the instrumentalisation of animals for human 
interests in problematic ways. Interventions in ecosystems through genome 
editing  could  serve  their  flourishing  and  those  of  the  people  and  animals 
living  in  them,  just  as  they  can  have  profound  negative  systemic 
consequences. 

All  of  this  urgently  requires  ethical  reflection,  debate  and  assessment  in 
order to shape the application of the technology and to develop governance 
in a way that is in accordance with fundamental rights and freedoms as well 
as  basic  beliefs  regarding  how  we  should  treat  human  and  non-human 
living  beings  and  the  environment.  Against  this  background,  the  European 
Commission requested the EGE to submit an Opinion and recommendations 
on  genome  editing,  thereby  following  up  on  the  EGE’s  Statement  on  Gene 
Editing, issued in January 2016.3 To develop this Opinion, the EGE draws on 
an  already  wide  range  of  opinions  and  statements  of  national  ethics 
councils, 
societies  and  other 
organisations,  as  well  as  on  scientific  literature.  In  addition,  the  EGE  has 
organised an Open Round Table and an International Dialogue in Brussels in 
order  to  incorporate  the  experience  and  expertise  of  various  stakeholders. 
Furthermore, the EGE has liaised with the WHO Expert Advisory Committee 
on  Developing  Global  Standards  for  Governance  and  Oversight  of  Human 
Genome Editing. 

scientific  academies,  professional 

With  this  Opinion,  the  EGE  does  not  intend  to  provide  an  exhaustive 
overview  of  the  scientific  state  of  the  art,  or  a  comprehensive  ethical 
analysis  across  all  domains.  Genome  editing  of  microorganisms,  for 
instance,  could  result  in  bioweapons  in  the  hand  of  people  with  criminal 
intentions.  Such  dual  use  is  an  aspect  of  concern  which  the  Opinion  does 
not  address.  Instead,  our  approach  is  to  focus  on  salient  cross-cutting 
issues while considering a wide range of different application areas, and to 
examine  how  specifically  the  EU  can  and  should  shape  governance  and 
policies  for  genome  editing.  The  Opinion  highlights  the  questions  that  we 
have  identified  as  key  ethical  concerns  because  they  are  deemed 
particularly  ethically  problematic,  they  are  new  and  distinctive  to  this 
technology, or they have particular salience at the EU level.  

The  EGE  has  endeavoured  to  balance  taking  into  account  of  specific 
application  areas  and  due  consideration  of  crosscutting  themes.  The  focus 
on  the  broader  picture  also  raises  awareness  of  the  problem  that  genome

editing could be hailed as a technological solution for serious issues of other 
kinds,  such  as  issues  resulting  from  entrenched  social  and  economic 
inequalities.  Some  key  leitmotifs  emerged  which  run  through  the  entire 
Opinion, in particular: 

  Metaphors, narratives and framings 

  Naturalness, custodianship and responsibility 

  Humanness and humanisation 

  Diversity, human diversity and biodiversity 

  Safety and proportionality, risk and uncertainty, and in particular how to 

transcend the ‘safe enough’ framing 

  Governance and ‘who gets to decide’ 

They  are  presented  succinctly  in  the  short  horizontal  chapter  that  follows. 
In  addition,  they  are  taken  up  further  in  the  relevant  chapters  of  the 
Opinion. 

1.1  Terminological clarifications: what we mean by genome 

editing 

It  is  difficult  to  precisely  define  the  process  of  gene  editing,  and  few  have 
attempted a definition. The term involves a (relatively) precise modification 
of  DNA  compared  to  that  which  was  previously  available  for  genetic 
modification  (defined  in  Directive  2001/18/EC4  and  in  the  Cartagena 
Protocol5), particularly of eukaryotes.6  

A  more  inclusive  term  that  has  become  widely  used  is  genome  editing.7  It 
involves  the  modification  of  the  genome  through  targeted  adding  of, 
replacing  of,  or  removing  one  or  more  DNA  base  pairs  in  the  genome, 
regardless of whether the modifications occur in a particular gene or a non-

surrounded  by  a  nuclear  envelope.  Eukaryotes  comprise  simple  one-celled  animals  and 
plants  through  to  complex  multicellular  organisms  like  humans.  They  are  different  from 
prokaryotes with no nuclei, such as bacteria.

transgenesis  –  the  transfer  of  genetic  elements  from  an  unrelated  or  non-
sexually  related  organism.  The  techniques  used  in  genome  editing8  are 
meant to be more precise than those which have in the past been used to 
genetically  modify  organisms,  and 
technologies  such  as 
CRISPR/CasX9  (where  X  is  usually  a  digit,  e.g.  9),  zinc  finger  nuclease

The European Union chose the term  genetic modification when referring to 
organisms  “in  which  the  genetic  material  has  been  altered  in  a  way  that 
does  not  occur  naturally  by  mating  and/or  natural  recombination.”13  The 
preferred terminology in the United States has been genetic engineering; in 
2017  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  suggested  a  new 
definition  for  genetic  engineering  as  a  family  of  “techniques  that  use 
recombinant  or  synthetic  nucleic  acids  with  the  intent  to  create  or  alter  a 
genome.”14 In 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled15 that 
organisms  obtained  by  mutagenesis16  are  GMOs  and  are,  in  principle, 
subject  to  the  obligations  laid  down  by  the  GMO  Directive  (Directive 
2001/18/EC),  with  a  caveat  that,  “However,  organisms  obtained  by 
mutagenesis techniques which have conventionally been used in a number 
of  applications  and  have  a  long  safety  record  are  exempt  from  those 
obligations,  on  the  understanding  that  the  Member  States  are  free  to 
subject  them,  in  compliance  with  EU  law,  to  the  obligations  laid  down  by 
the directive or to other obligations.”17

Ethics of Genome Editing 

In  2020,  France’s  highest  administrative  court  ruled  that  any  genetic 
modification  technique  developed  since  the  adoption  of  the  original  GMO 
Directive  in  2001  generates  a  product  considered  to  be  a  GMO  that  falls 
under  the  respective  regulations,  including  in  vitro  chemical  and  radiation 
mutagenesis on plant cells.18 

The  processes  available  for  genome  editing  are  continually  evolving,  in 
particular with regard to the precision of the insertion or deletion of bases. 
An  example  is  that  which  has  been  termed  ‘prime  editing’,  designed  to 
address  some  of  the  problems  with  current  technologies  using  a 
“catalytically  impaired  Cas9  endonuclease  fused  to  an  engineered  reverse 
transcriptase,  programmed  with  a  prime  editing  guide  RNA  (pegRNA)  that 
both  specifies  the  target  site  and  encodes  the  desired  edit.”19  Editing  of 
messenger  RNA20  has  also  become  possible,  just  as  has  editing  of  the 
eukaryotic epigenome (“which has an instrumental role in determining and 
maintaining cell identity and function”21). 

Genome  editing,  the  overall  term  used  throughout  this  Opinion  with  the 
caution underscored here, is not to be taken to mean just a change of the 
whole  genome,  but  also  a  specific  change  (or  set  of  changes)  in  the 
genome.

2  CROSS-CUTTING AND UNDERPINNING ASPECTS 

Ethics of Genome Editing 

2.1  Metaphors, narratives and framings 

It  is  well  established  that  the  language  that  we  use  to  frame  reality  does 
not  merely  represent  reality  but  also  shape  it.22  With  the  increasing 
adoption of genome editing, claims were made that scientists were not only 
able to ‘read’ the ‘Book of Life’ (and ‘see’ who we, as humans, are, such as 
in the context of the Human Genome Project in the 1990s and 2000s), but 
were now also able to ‘write’ it and ‘edit’ it. These metaphors are more than 
mere semantics: The words used to describe a phenomenon have an impact 
on  people’s  understandings  and  attitudes.  Metaphors  are  important  in 
guiding the general understanding of scientific advances and are believed to 
influence  people’s  views  on  the  use  of  CRISPR/CasX.23  As  also  the  media 
play an important role in this, the specific terminology – and the metaphors 
–  used  by  media  reports  also  have  an  impact  on  people’s  views  and 
understandings,  and  not  always  in  the  ways  intended  by  scientists. 
Regarding  a  technology  such  as  CRISPR/CasX  it  is  thus  particularly 
important for ethical reflection to pay careful attention to the words we use 
to  describe  the  problem  at  hand.  The  problem  description  makes  certain 
ways to address it more plausible than others. 

For  science,  bioethics,  and  the  public,  a  key  question  is  also:  how  can  our 
language be honest about the uncertainties in how we will develop and use 
the technology, and what promise and risk its use holds, without employing 
terms that trigger gut reaction rather than thoughtful deliberation?24 Words 
may have consequences and they need to be used ‘responsibly’ in order to 
help ensure that the public and public policy stakeholders are well informed 
regarding this new technology, since words influence how we act upon and 
shape the world in which we live.25

Ethics of Genome Editing 

2.2  Naturalness, custodianship and responsibility 

Genome  editing  questions  common  understandings  of  naturalness. 
Naturalness,  in  turn,  is  an  ambiguous  notion  (and  sometimes  best 
understood  in  relation  to  contrary  ones:  what  is  unnatural?).  First  and 
foremost, we have to start by recognising that what is natural is often taken 
to  be  what  is  ‘normal’,  or  even  self-evident,  or  indeed  seen  as  in 
accordance  with  the  laws  of  nature  –  through  to  natural  law  and  natural 
rights  as  a  bedrock  of  human  rights.  Against  that  backdrop,  secondly,  the 
natural  is  in  a  close  connection  (or  in  a  generative  tension)  with  the 
supernatural, the spiritual, the divine, the demiurgic, ‘the whole of creation’ 
or  ‘Mother  Nature’.  Gene  drives  throw  into  sharp  relief  the  fact  that  a 
‘targeted’  intervention  in  a  genome  can  have  sweeping  implications  for 
entire  species,  for  the  precarious  evolving  balance  between  species,  and 
indeed  for  entire  ecosystems.  The  previous  considerations  also  underscore 
that, 
its  antithetic  or 
complementary  notions,  the  cultural,  the  technical,  the  artificial,  the 
‘human-made’. 

the  natural  stands 

in  relation 

thirdly, 

to 

Those  three  dimensions  jointly  foreground  this  key  area  of  reflection:  the 
role of humans – and of humanity – in relation to ‘Nature’, from alienation 
and emancipation through to belonging and interdependence, from ‘masters 
and  possessors’  through  to  humility  and  inspiration,  to  stewardship  and 
custodianship.  Here  it  is  also  anthropocentric  and  speciesist  presumptions 
that are opened up, and with them new ethics perspectives.  

This is  a  central  set  of  issues  with  regard  to  the  ethics  of  genome  editing, 
not only because of possible perceptions of ‘tampering with the book of life’ 
or  ‘challenging  divine  creation’  (notably  humans  created  in  the  likeness  of 
the  divine  in  certain  traditions),  not  only  because  of  the  weight  of 
responsibility  attached  to  transforming  nature  as  well  as  to  transforming 
human nature (under the looming spectre of eugenics), but also because of 
core  issues  of  justice,  solidarity  and  dignity  thrown  open  by  the  political 
economy of the genome. 

2.3  Humanness and humanisation 

As  humans,  we  have  an  existential  concern  for  what  it  is  that  makes  us 
human,  for  what  distinguishes  humans  from  other  forms  of  life,  of 
intelligence, sentience, consciousness; and also for what responsibilities are 
incumbent upon humans – and humanity – with regard to others. 

16  

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 

 
Ethics of Genome Editing 

This deep concern takes on newfound significance in the context of genome 
editing,  as  the  human  genome,  taken  as  essential  or  foundational  of 
humanness,  becomes  up  for  grabs.  This  raises  the  question  which  role 
genes  have  for  the  human  species  and  the  human  individual,  which  is  in 
part  discussed  under  the  notions  of  ‘genetic  exceptionalism’  and  ‘genetic 
determinism’.26  

The  term  ‘humanisation’  is  ambiguous  and  may  refer  to  several  different 
dimensions: it may pertain to a scientific/technical definition (e.g. changing 
receptor cells on organs of non-human beings into human ones or changing 
a given sequence of a  gene into its human equivalent; thus mice modified 
to  carry  one  or  more  human  genes  are  often  referred  to  as  ‘humanised 
mice’)  or  it  may  refer  to  scenarios  where  cognitive  capacity  is  modified 
(‘enhanced’)  to  such  an  extent  that  species  categories,  or  distinctions 
between human and animal, become blurred (or that new ‘between-species’ 
categories are created). In the context of this Opinion, a key question and 
concern is the following: when non-human beings could gain characteristics 
normally  associated  with  humans,  what  is  their  status  and  what  are  the 
rights  and  obligations 
In  addition,  when  considering 
humanisation, it is also crucial to extend the reflection to its correlates: de-
humanisation and de-animalisation (or more broadly de-speciesation).  

that  arise? 

This set of questions is relevant across all species, applications and areas. It 
is even more saliently so in the context of genome editing involving (‘non-
human’) animals – and more particularly non-human primates (NHPs).  

Compounded by genome editing, boundary-work around humanness is also 
deserving of particular ethical attention in the context of xenobiotechnology 
and specifically of xenotransplantation. 

As is the case for each of the cross-cutting issues drawn attention to in this 
preliminary section, these matters are discussed in the relevant chapters of 
the Opinion.  

26  ‘Genetic  exceptionalism’  is  the  idea  that  the  genome,  together  with  genetic  data,  is  of  a 
radically  different  (more  sensitive,  more  important,  or  more  essential)  nature  compared  to 
everything  else.  ‘Genetic  determinism’  is  the  notion  that  human  behaviour  is  directly 
controlled  –  indeed  determined  –  by  a  person’s  genes,  at  the  expense  of  the  role  of  other 
factors.  By  extension,  it  is  the  notion  that  human  nature,  what  makes  a  being  a  human 
being, is nothing more and nothing less than that being’s genes.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

2.4  Diversity, human diversity and biodiversity 

Genome  editing  affects  diversity  in  important  ways.  As  this  Opinion  will 
show,  the  new  avenues  offered  by  genome  editing  open  the  possibility  to 
expand  or  narrow  genetic  diversity  across  the  different  domains  of  these 
technologies’  application,  including  in  people,  agricultural  plants  and 
livestock,  and  wider  ecosystems.  While  the  ethical  implications,  including 
the  desirability  or  otherwise  of  such  outcomes,  will  be  explored  within  the 
relevant  chapters,  it  is  useful  to  foreground  this  discussion  by  examining 
the broad values attached to the notion of diversity and the obligations that 
may flow from it. 

Diversity  is  commonly  understood27  as  the  richness  and  variety  of  distinct 
objects  or  types,  whether  that  be  at  the  level  of  genomes,  organisms, 
species  or  ecosystems.28  Measures  of  diversity  take  into  account  not  only 
the variety but also the commonness or rarity of a species, trait or object.  

In  many  contexts,  diversity  has  risen  to  the  status  of  an  accepted  ‘good’, 
and  a  social  goal  to  be  protected  and  promoted,29  often  against  a 
background  of  its  perceived  precariousness  due  to  human  activity.  What 
kinds  of  values  are  being  attached  to  a  multiplicity  of  life  forms  –  from 
where do they derive?  

One  set  of  approaches  focuses  on  the  instrumental  or  anthropocentric 
value,  in  so  far  as  diversity  serves  the  interests  of  humankind.  In  the 
ecological  sphere,  evidence 
indicates  that  more  diverse  ecological 
communities  are  more  stable  and  resilient  than  those  that  are  less 
diverse.30 A wider range of genes or species within an ecosystem improves 

27  This  notwithstanding,  conceptually  the  issue  of  defining  and  quantifying  diversity  is  not 
straightforward.  See  the  longstanding  debates  over  the  concept  and  measurement  of 
biodiversity in the ecological arena. (Maclaurin & Sterelny, 2008) 

28  The  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  applies  the  definition  as  follows:  “the  variability 
among  living  organisms  from  all  sources  including,  inter  alia,  terrestrial,  marine,  and  other 
aquatic  ecosystems  and  the  ecological  complexes  of  which  they  are  a  part;  this  includes 
diversity within species and of ecosystems.” (Article 2, Convention on Biological Diversity) 
29 The Convention on Biological Diversity, for instance, emerged out of a universal consensus 
that  biodiversity  is of  immense value  to  humankind  and must  be  protected by  international 
law.  Similarly  by  the  early  2000s,  the  protection  of  cultural  and/or  linguistic  diversity  had 
emerged as a socio-political movement with the endorsement of international bodies such as 
UNESCO.

its  functioning  and  adaptability.31  Humans  benefit  insofar  as  they  are 
dependent on, and profit from, a flourishing natural world.   

For  others, diversity derives its value from the presumption of an inherent 
or  intrinsic  value  within  all  beings,  that  nature  is  worthy  of  moral 
consideration,  and  that  this  confers  relevant  obligations  and  duties.32  The 
assumption of a ‘balance of nature’, which has developed in many societies, 
can be seen as an attempt to bridge these positions – the instrumental and 
the intrinsic – by presuming that the planetary community is and persists in 
a  natural  equilibrium  due  to  the  interactions  between  its  constituent 
entities.33   

Current  debates  surrounding  potential  uses  of  genome  editing  technology 
tap  into  the  above-described  approaches,  both  instrumental  and  intrinsic. 
Genome editing has been proposed as a means to understand and preserve 
corals  and  their  ecosystems,34  to  diversify  agriculture  to  shore  up  food 
security,35  to  combat  invasive  species  plaguing  ecosystems  around  the 
world,36 and even to resurrect extinct species.37  

Debates  surrounding  such  propositions 
invoke  notions  of  human 
responsibility  towards  non-human  species,  human  custodianship  over 
nature,  as  well  as  critiques  of  human  hubris  in  our  relationship  with  non-
human life (commodification of nature, ‘who are we to decide?’ questions). 
Here  the  role  of  human  causality  is  often  used  as  a  guide  for  action,  an 
responsibility  where 
environmentalist  ethos 
anthropocentric  effects  are  found  to  have  driven  diversity  loss  or  species 
extinction  (which,  by  extension  and  in  passing,  would  rule  out  any 
obligation to reverse-engineer the woolly mammoth).

An  examination  of  humans’  responsibility  towards  other  species  must  also 
consider  human  responsibility  towards  other  humans.  This  is  particularly 
relevant in light of the  potential of genome  editing to impact on the scope 
and  nature  of  human  genetic  variation.  By  opening  the  prospect  to  curb 
serious diseases and disabilities, it prompts a serious discussion both about

the  biological  impacts  of  tinkering  with  the  reservoir  of  human  genetic 
variation, as well as the social implications.  

Diversity  does  not  stand  alone  as  a  value,  rather  it  is  context-dependent. 
Our relationship to diversity, the norms and obligations surrounding it, and 
in  particular  any  attempt  to  draw  conclusions  about  those  features  to  be 
deemed worthy of protection or liable to be jettisoned, must recognise the 
cultural,  historical,  biological  and  ecological  factors  guiding  those  choices. 
These  must  take  into  account  past,  present  and  future  generations  in  all 
their diversity.  

2.5  Transcending the ‘safe enough’ framing 

Whereas  debates  about  genome  editing  often  focus  on  the  question  ‘how 
safe  is  safe  enough?’,  the  EGE  draws  attention  to  the  importance  of 
nuancing  and  resisting  this  framing.  The  ‘safe  enough’  narrative  purports 
that  it  is  enough  for  a  given  level  of  safety  to  be  reached  in  order  for  a 
technology to be rolled out unhindered, and limits reflections on ethics and 
governance to considerations about safety.  

Three  perspectives  are  particularly  important  in  this  regard.  Firstly,  the 
‘safe  enough’  narrative  correlates  with  the  risk  analysis  framework  and 
more  particularly  with  the  fraught  notions  of  ‘zero  risk’  and  of  ‘acceptable 
risk’. The latter is problematic in several ways. We always take risks. Which 
risks we  accept depends  on the situation and the possible benefits.  In this 
context,  the  ‘safe  enough’  narrative  can  lead  us  to  falsely  believe  that  if  a 
technology  is  ‘safe  enough’  there  are  no  risks.  Further,  what  is  considered 
‘safe  enough’  is  highly  context-dependent.  What  is  needed  instead  is  a 
consideration  of  the  complete  decision  problem;  to  take  sound,  well-
reasoned  decisions;  to  look  at  both  the  pros  and  the  cons;  indeed  to 
consider  not  just  the  risks  and  costs  but  also  the  possible  benefits,  in  the 
widest sense, and the distribution thereof. 

Secondly,  the  restrictive  focus  on  ‘safe  enough’  for  genome  editing is  akin 
to the process of ‘securitisation’ discussed in EGE Opinion 28 in the context 
of  security  technologies.38  In  the  crispest  form,  that  is,  ‘safe  enough’

becomes the alpha and omega, both the  cop-out and the  carte blanche as 
well as the tree that hides the forest. 

Thirdly,  the  ‘safe  enough’  framing  is  reminiscent  of  the  ‘technological 
imperative’, the notion  that ‘if it is technologically feasible then it ought to 
be  done’.  This  eschews  more  ethically  pressing  questions  such  as  whether 
genome editing is in fact necessary, acceptable, and under what conditions. 
To be clear, it is not that the technological imperative necessarily entails a 
‘safe  enough’  narrative,  but  capturing  the  attention  and  imagination  with 
‘safe  enough?’  can  lead  to  obfuscating  other  questions  and  indeed  to 
making this one question the ‘one door – one key’ of technological roll-out. 
All of this under the guise of promoting sound decision making and shared 
values, with safety as (least or sole) common denominator. 

Questioning  the  ‘safe  enough’  narrative  is  cognate  to  questioning  the 
tendency of scientific and technological developments to mould governance 
and indeed ethics. This also extends to questions of coordination, diversity, 
inequalities  and  power  relations  (i.e.  Who  gets  to  decide  how  safe  is  safe 
enough? And by which processes?).  In  fact, ‘safety’  or ‘trustworthiness’ do 
not  pertain  solely  to  technologies  but  also  to  institutions  and  forms  of 
governance  in  societies  –  including  matters  of  oversight  as  well  as  of 
democracy and rule of law. 

2.6  Governance and ‘who should decide’ 

Governance  is  a  cross-cutting  issue  and  it  is  important  to  unpack  its 
different facets. A first component is the state of the existing and emerging 
legislative  and  regulatory  approaches  across  the  different  purposes  and 
domains  (humans,  non-human  animals,  plants,  microorganisms,  gene 
drives).  These  are  indicated  in  the  subsequent  chapters  of  the  present 
Opinion.  A  related  component  is  the  historical  dimension  and  legacy  of 
legislative  approaches  (with  questions  of  path  dependency,  institutional 
mimesis,  transnational  epistemic  communities,  forms  of  socialisation  and 
learning), which is also addressed there.  

The  most  salient  feature  of  the  current  situation  is  the  lack  of  robust 
structures  of  global  governance,  as  strikingly  brought  to  light  by  the 
genome editing revelations at the end of 2018.39 We recognise that genome 
editing technologies, particularly their application in humans, amongst other

Ethics of Genome Editing 

technologies,  require  a  global  governance  approach.  As  a  corollary,  it  is 
difficult  to  take  regulatory  measures  of  worldwide  scope  that  are  efficient 
and respected by all States, so that these commit to ensuring compliance in 
their respective territories. 

Proposing criteria for the governance of genome editing, notably concerning 
human germline, is not an easy task.  This requires reflection on the forms 
of uncertainties, on the rights and values involved (notably human dignity, 
solidarity,  right  to  identity),  on  the  expectations  generated  by  this 
technique,  and  on  the  limits  and  principles  that  should  govern  its 
application  (safety,  effectiveness,  efficiency,  transparency,  common  good, 
accountability, proportionality, etc.). 

Key questions with regard to the different aspects of governance are: How 
are  decisions  to  be  made?  Who  decides  and  who  ought  to  decide?  These 
questions  pertain  to  the  geopolitical  level  (e.g.  the  strong  influence  of  the 
USA and China in the global governance arena to date), to the disciplinary 
level (e.g. divisions and dominance of certain branches of science; primacy 
of some natural scientific disciplines over other fields also in the humanities 
and  social  sciences),  to  the  stakeholder  level  (the  need  for  participatory 
approaches, questions of public trust), extending to the wider public (going 
beyond  ‘present  generations’  and  ‘political  participation’)  and  anticipatory 
governance. With respect to the collective experiments in developing forms 
of governance of genome editing, across the globe, we should address how 
we can establish systems which can both monitor developments and enable 
to  draw  lessons  (including  mutual  learning  across  different  areas  in  the 
ethics  and  governance  of  sciences  and  technologies,  such  as  ‘artificial 
intelligence’, GMOs, genome editing).

3  GENOME EDITING IN HUMANS 

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Recent  advances  in  the  techniques  available  for  the  editing  of  the  human 
genome  have  given  rise  to  significant  debate.  There  is  a  spate  of 
committees, reports and recommendations on its feasibility, desirability, as 
well  as  ethical  and  governance  implications.40  Against  this  background,  in 
this Opinion the EGE focuses on what it considers to be two key aspects of 
particular  importance  regarding  somatic  and  germline  genome  editing  in 
humans. 

First,  there  are  fundamental  conceptual  considerations  that  are  crucial  for 
an  ethical  assessment  of  genome  editing  applications,  also  with  regard  to 
their global impact. They concern views on the nature of human beings, the 
relevance and status of the genome in this, the identification of humans as 
a  species  and  the  implications  of  belonging  to  it,41  as  well  as  the 
relationships  of  people  to  themselves,  to  each  other  and  to  the 
environment.  Our  conceptualisations  of  this  shape  how  we  perceive  the 
plethora of phenomena in the world, how we behave and how we intervene 
in our environment. 

Second, the safety of a technology is generally seen as a criterion of crucial 
ethical  importance.  A  technological intervention  is  meant  to  benefit  people 
and  society  without  undue  (disproportionate)  negative  consequences  for 
individuals  or  groups.  There  are  different  views  on  what  constitutes  a 
benefit,  a  risk  or  a  harm,  depending,  among  other  factors,  on  scientific 
evidence,  but  also  on  personal  preferences  and  values,  as  well  as  wider 
contexts of culture, societal attitudes, existing governance frameworks and 
the framing of the scientific landscape. Determining what is ‘safe enough’ is 
not only about knowledge, but also about values, and scientific theories and 
practices are themselves value-laden.  

There is a longstanding practice  of weighing potential benefits and risks in 
clinical  research  and  in  healthcare  for  somatic  genome  editing,  but  with 
regard  to  germline  editing  the  question  of  safety  is  more  complex.  Its

difficulty  mainly  relates  to  the  fact  that  the  genetic  conditions  –  the 
biological starting point for the entire organism throughout the whole life of 
the  person  –  are  changed,  and  that  future  generations  will  be  affected  by 
this.  The  question  as  to  which  criteria  must  be  fulfilled  so  that  germline 
genome  editing  can  be  considered  ‘safe  enough’  and  how  to  come  to  this 
conclusion requires discussion. This will be part of the second section. 

3.1  Conceptual considerations 

Given the powerful technologies available today to edit the human genome, 
there  is  a  requirement  to  assess  their  impact  on  shared  ethical  principles 
and fundamental rights and freedoms, including the dignity of every human 
being, the right to life, health and bodily as well as mental integrity, respect 
for  autonomy,  freedom  of  research,  justice,  non-discrimination  and 
solidarity.  These  aspects  are  already  discussed  in  detail  elsewhere.42  In 
addition,  there  are  other  important  conceptual  frameworks  underlying  and 
orienting  the  ethical  discussion.  They  refer  to  general  concepts  of 
humanness,  naturalness  and  diversity,  as  well  as  to  distinctions  between 
therapy, prevention and enhancement.  

These  concepts  and  related  values  are  invoked  when  thinking  about  a 
technology  and  setting  up  guidance  for  its  use.  A  division  into  science  on 
the one hand and ethics on the other, or ethics as kind of an afterthought,43 
overlooks  the  fact  that  the  entire  process  of  scientific  activity,  from  the 
formulation  of  the  research  question  to  the  conduct  of  research  and  the 
evaluation  and  interpretation  of  data  is  permeated  with  preferences  and 
values.  Also  science  governance  systems  necessarily  involve  overarching 
conceptual ideas and ethical perspectives. Accordingly, the expert advisory 
committee established by the WHO in 2018 “to develop global standards for 
governance  and  oversight  of  human  genome  editing” is  committed  to  take 
into  consideration  “the  scientific,  ethical,  social  and  legal  challenges” 
associated with somatic and germline genome editing, with the aim to issue 
recommendations on appropriate institutional, national, regional and global 
governance mechanisms.44 

42 Cf. the references above. 
43 This kind of view is implicit in the approach of the International Commission on the Clinical 

Use of Human Germline Genome Editing in its report from September 2020.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

3.1.1  Humanness and naturalness 

The question of humanness and thus of what constitutes a human being can 
be discussed from various perspectives, including biomedical, philosophical, 
sociological,  ethical  or  religious  ones,  and  by  referring  to  biological, 
ontological, or social features. It is an anthropological question that people 
have dealt with for centuries. What is typical for the human species, what is 
unique to the human species? It also asks about the positioning of humans 
in nature and in the cosmos – eventually in the context of all that exists.  

Until the late 1970s, no deliberate targeted technological intervention could 
bring a human into being. With the technical possibility of bringing together 
egg  and  sperm  outside  of  the  female  body,  the  emergence  of  a  human 
being  came  into  the  hands  of  third  parties  who  are  otherwise  not  involved 
in  the  process  of  natural  conception.  It  thus  became  available  for 
intervention.  With  the  CRISPR/CasX  techniques,  the  opportunity  for 
intervention  has  become  so  specific  that  even  the  genetic  make-up  of  the 
human  embryo  is  at  the  designer’s  disposal.  Is  this  an  intervention  in 
humanness?  Biologically  speaking,  no  –  not  as  long  as  only  such  genetic 
changes are made that lead to genes that are otherwise present in humans. 
Even if DNA from another organism is introduced in a human genome this 
does  not  change  the  humanness  of  that  entity.  There  is  no  percentage  or 
sharp  threshold  beyond  which  the  host  is  no  longer  considered  to  be 
human. 

However,  the  question  arises  whether  a  change  in  the  initial  genetic 
condition  of  a  human  being  fundamentally  alters  the  nature  of  humanness 
or  rather  the  relationship  between  humans  by  making  them  unequal  with 
regard to their genetic starting conditions: those from one human being can 
be submitted to deliberate and targeted editing by another human being. In 
this  manner,  an  engineering/design  approach  in  human  genomics  may 
undermine  fundamental  equality  of  all  human  beings,  which  implies  that 
there  are  “no  discontinuities  in  the  range  of  humanity  that  would  accord 
some  humans  a  lower  status  than  others.”45  Such  equality  implies  that  all 
human  beings  have  equal  worth  and  are  accorded  human  dignity,  without 
exception. This basic equal regard cannot be earned and is never a matter 
of merit, desert or design. 

How  can  it  then  be  classified,  ethically,  that  a  human  being  does  not  owe 
his  or  her  genetic  make-up  to  chance  –  so  to  say  to  ‘nature’,  in  terms  of

Ethics of Genome Editing 

independency from deliberate and targeted human intervention – but to the 
deliberate  shaping  of  it  by  other  human  beings?  Is  this  intervention  so 
fundamental that no human being should ever assume responsibility for it, 
and that germline genome editing should hence be categorically forbidden? 
Or does the possibility of the intervention make it necessary to assume this 
responsibility, for example when it enables to prevent a serious disease? 

That  the  intervention  in  the  genome  of  a  human  embryo  is  considered 
particularly  serious  is  partly  due  to  the  consequence  of  this  intervention  – 
the  change  is  also  passed  on  to  next  generations.  It  is  also  due  to  the 
perception  that  the  genome  is  something  very  special  for  living  beings,  as 
discussed  under  the  notion  of  ‘genetic  exceptionalism’.46  A  view  on  the 
human genome as being the ‘code’ of the individual is countered by the fact 
that  genes  do  not  (solely)  determine  the  individual,  their  personality  and 
life;  they  only  provide  a  framework  within  which  human  beings  can 
determine themselves and lead their lives in many different ways. The role 
of the genome for the individual and the human community is also assessed 
differently in different cultures and can change over time.  

A  related  question  arises  as  to  whether  a  human  embryo  whose  genome 
has been edited is still the same human being after the occurred alteration. 
Is the genome of a human being considered so essential for the dignity and 
identity of a person that a genetic modification at zygote state makes her a 
different person? Or is it rather her entire living as a being with body, mind 
and emotions, her narrative? This question refers to the concept of genetic 
exceptionalism  as  well,  in  the  sense  that  the  genetic  component  of  a 
person’s  individuality  is  considered  more  important,  or  in  another  way 
different,  from  other,  non-genetic  factors  that  make  a  person.47  Genetic 
exceptionalism and determinism would imply that editing a disease-causing 
gene  in  a  zygote  means  creating  another  human  being,  or  an  intervention 
‘by’ creating another human being, rather than treatment or prevention. 

Against  the  background  of  these  far-reaching  questions  about  concepts  of 
humanness  and  naturalness  and  their  ethical  dimensions,  it  is  clear  that 
there is no one scientific, unambiguous and thus binding answer as to what 
the relation between the genome of a human  embryo and humanness and 
naturalness  is,  and  what  ethical  orientation  this  can  provide.  Rather,  the 
need  arises  for  a  broad,  inclusive  and  nuanced  social  debate  on  the

takes all perspectives into account and brings them into discussion. 

Ethics of Genome Editing 

3.1.2  Diversity 

Genome editing, with its ability to modify genome types, bears on diversity 
in  important  ways.  New  genome  editing  techniques  open  the  possibility  to 
expand  or  narrow  genetic  diversity  across  the  different  domains  of  their 
application.  Regarding  humans,  diversity  is  commonly  understood  as  the 
richness  and  variety  of  cultures,  age,  gender,  beliefs  and  world  views, 
amongst others. It also entails biological features such as genes. Measures 
of diversity take into account not only the variety but also the commonness 
or  rarity  of  a  trait  or  feature.  In  many  contexts,  diversity  has  risen  to  the 
status  of  an  accepted  ‘good’,  and  a  social  goal  to  be  protected  and 
promoted.48  In  regard  to  genome  editing  in  humans,  a  variety  of 
implications has to be discussed.  

In  order  to  significantly  influence  the  diversity  of  the  human  gene  pool,  a 
very  broad  use  of  genome  editing  on  embryos  over  many  generations 
would be necessary. Currently, such a development is not foreseeable, but 
no definite statements can be made about future application scenarios. That 
genome  editing  presents  the  prospect  of  curbing  serious  diseases  and 
disabilities prompts important discussions about both the biological impacts 
of  ‘tinkering’  with  the  reservoir  of  human  genetic  variation,  as  well  as  the 
social implications. ‘Children of a Lesser God’ made such stakes palpable to 
a  wide  public  in  1986.  It  has  been  argued  that  diversity  “may  encourage 
people  to  appreciate  difference  and  care  for  and  respect  others,  whereas 
having  less  diversity  might  make  the  lives  of  those  with  less  common 
genetic  traits  still  more  marginal.”49  This  is  thus  about  the  particularly 
fraught  issue  of  determining  the  kind  of  people  a  society  might  want  to 
have,  and  who  gets  to  decide  that  a  specific  variation  is  –  or  is  not  –  a 
problem in need of a genetic, technological ‘solution’. 

48 The Convention on Biological Diversity, for instance, emerged out of a universal consensus 
that  biodiversity  is of  immense value  to  humankind  and must  be  protected by  international 
law.  Similarly  by  the  early  2000s,  the  protection  of  cultural  and/or  linguistic  diversity  had 
emerged as a socio-political movement with the endorsement of international bodies such as 
UNESCO.

It  is  important  to  recall  at  this  point  that  the  notion  of  ‘diversity’  on  the 
human  level  is  extended  beyond  the  realm  of  (epi)genetics  to  encompass 
different  human  languages,  cultures,  identities  and  beliefs.  The  values 
placed  on  this  kind  of  diversity  can  echo,  or  depart  from,  those  in  the 
biological domain (contending that cultural and linguistic diversity increases 
the adaptational strength of human societies, with a wider range of human 
knowledge and – by making us aware of a variety of distinct human ways of 
life – of counter-factual possibilities, ‘other ways of living’). In fact, cultural 
and  linguistic  diversity  is  protected  by  the  international  human  rights 
framework,  reflecting  the  link  between  human  diversity  and  values  of 
freedom,  autonomy,  justice  and  solidarity.  These  links  are  historically 
embedded:  we  cannot  reflect  upon  human  diversity  without  taking  into 
account  relationships  of  power  and  histories  of  oppression,  colonialism, 
exploitation and marginalisation that have come alongside. 

Diversity  therefore  does  not  stand  alone  as  a  value,  rather  it  is  context-
dependent.  Our  relationship  to  diversity,  the  norms  and  obligations 
surrounding  it,  and  in  particular  any  attempt  to  draw  conclusions  about 
those features to be deemed worthy of protection or liable to be jettisoned, 
must  recognise  the  cultural,  historical,  biological  and  ecological  factors 
guiding  those  choices.  These  must  take  into  account  past,  present  and 
future generations in all their diversity.  

3.1.3  The  distinction  between  therapy,  prevention  and 

enhancement 

The editing of the genome in human germ cells and embryos can reduce or 
remove  the  risk  that  children  (and  subsequent  generations)  will  develop 
genetic diseases.  It also allows us to modify genetic traits of a person and 
shape  them  according  to  medical,  societal  and  personal  preferences,  such 
as  the  eye  colour  or  the  sensitivity  to  pain.50  The  scientific,  medical, 
regulatory  and  societal  conditions  under  which  germline  genome  editing 
may be determined to be necessary and acceptable remain contentious. In 
this  debate,  the  distinction  between  therapy,  prevention  and  enhancement 
as purposes of genome editing is often referred to.  

Although  therapy,  prevention  and  enhancement  cannot  always  be  clearly 
separated  from  each  other,  there  are  some  definitional  characteristics  that 
provide  orientation.  Prevention  and  therapy  relate  to  a  disease  or

impairment,  whereas  enhancement  refers  to  the  improvement  of  a 
statistically  and  medically  ‘normal’  feature  or  function.  Prevention  means 
the  avoidance  of  a  disease  or  impairment,  respectively  avoiding  their 
aggravation  or  recurrence,  whereas  therapy  aims  at  restoring  health  or 
alleviating symptoms of a disease. The use of genome editing for purposes 
of therapy (also depending on the seriousness of a disease) seems to be far 
more acceptable for most people than its use for purposes of enhancement. 

Therapy can only apply if there is disease and thus only refer to individuals 
who  are  suffering  from  a  disease.  A  human  embryo  in  an  early 
developmental stage can be a carrier of a gene that will lead to a disease in 
the course of further development, but cannot suffer from a disease in the 
way a born human being can, with physical symptoms and the personal and 
social experience of illness.  Therapeutic genome  editing can therefore  only 
apply to somatic genome editing. 

Enhancement can be applied with regard to different kinds of  features and 
impact,  for  example,  biological,  cognitive  or  social  functions.  It  aims  at 
changing  them  in  a  way  that  is  considered  as  making  them  ‘better  than 
normal’  for  the  individual  concerned  or  better  than  what  is  ‘normal’  for 
humans  in  general.  However,  what  is  ‘normal’  is  often  not  clearly  defined 
and its definition changes over time and among societies.51 Normal can, for 
instance,  refer  to  a  statistical  distribution,  to  a  defined  threshold  or  to  a 
biological  function  of  an  organ.  To  name  an  example,  a  new  medical 
definition  for  the  thresholds  delimiting  high  or  low  blood  pressure  can 
render  thousands  of  people  ill  who  were  previously  considered  healthy, 
without anything having changed in their body.52  

The  WHO-defines  health  broadly,  as  “a  state  of  complete  physical, 
psychological  and  social  wellbeing”53  and  hence  also  highlights  the 
complexity of distinguishing therapy and enhancement, with the delineation 
not  only  depending  on  objective  parameters  but  also  on  subjective 
perception. 

Dis-enhancement  is  discussed  less  often.  When  it  is,  it  usually  refers  to  a 
removal  or  worsening  of  biological  functions.  Some  persons  who  are  born 
deaf,  for  instance,  do  not  perceive  their  deafness  as  a  disease  or 
impairment  but  rather  as  a  condition  that  is  normal  for  them  and  that

contributes  to  their  specific  culture  with,  for  example,  their  own  language. 
They  may  therefore  also  wish  their  children  to  be  deaf  and,  after 
preimplantation  diagnosis,  transfer  only  the  respective  embryos.  With 
germline genome editing, it would be technically feasible to alter a gene so 
that  deafness  occurs.  While  the  community  concerned  may  not  describe 
such intervention as dis-enhancement, the wider public may perceive it as a 
diminishment of capacities usually present in humans. 

Prevention  has  been  defined  as  “activities  that  are  designed  to  reduce  the 
likelihood that something harmful will occur, or to minimise that harm if it 
does  occur.”54  There

enhancement;  some  genome  editing  modifications  could  serve  both 
objectives. 

is  a  blurring 

The  EGE  holds  that  distinctions  between  therapy,  prevention  and 
enhancement can be  of some use for assessing the  ethical acceptability or 
even  desirability  of  somatic  and  germline  genome  editing.  They  can  be 
helpful  for  weighing  potential  benefits  and  harms  (see  also  3.2.  The  ‘safe 
enough’  criterion),  mostly  with  regard  to  the  alleviation  or  avoidance  of 
harm  justifying  greater  risks  than  the  enhancement  of  otherwise  ‘normal’ 
functions. Furthermore, social consequences have to be taken into account, 
at least if an intervention is applied on a larger scale and with transmissible 
modifications. 

Another  aspect  to  be  considered  is  feasibility.  Complex  traits  such  as 
cognition or common disease phenotypes are the result of the interaction of 
a  large  number  of  factors,  including  genetic  ones,  over  the  course  of 
development.  Research  in  genetics  and  developmental  biology  shows  that 
editing a single gene, or even small groups of genes will only have a minor 
impact on complex traits. Current research into germline genome editing in 
humans  involves  targeting  single  genes  that  are  heavily  implicated  in  the 
etiology  of  a  set  of  genetic  diseases  (monogenic,  autosomal,  inherited 
genetic  disorders).  In  this  sense,  applications  for  the  purpose  of 
enhancement  are  currently  not  possible.55  Yet,  they  might  become  a 
technologically feasible option in the future.

3.2  The ‘safe enough’ criterion 

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Safety often is at the centre of the debate on genome editing. All too often, 
the (more  or less explicit) underlying assumption is that it is enough  for a 
given  level  of  safety  to  be  reached  in  order  for  a  technology  to  be  rolled 
out;  and  all  too  often,  ethics  and  governance  reflections  get  restricted  to 
safety  aspects.  The  EGE  however  argues  that  a  technological  intervention 
has to be ‘safe enough’ in the terms of a broad and nuanced understanding 
of  the  notion.  Against  the  background  of  a  bio-psychosocial  understanding 
of  health,  much  has  to  be  considered.  Are  there  medical  risks  for  the 
application  of  germline  genome  editing  against  serious  diseases  or 
impairments?  Are  there  psychological  risks  for  individuals  after  germline 
genome  editing 
their  social 
relationships?  Are  there  social  risks  with  regard  to  discrimination  towards 
people  with  disabilities  or  inherited  disorders,  as  is  already  discussed 
regarding prenatal or preimplantation diagnostics? Are there long-term risks 
of  heritable  genome  editing  for  the  concerned  individual  or  for  future 
generations that can hardly be foreseen? 

their  self-perception  and 

regarding 

Safety  cannot  merely  refer  to  the  absence  of  any  risk,  as  no  technological 
intervention  is  without  risk.  The  question  rather  refers  to  what  can  be 
considered  as  as  ‘safe  enough’.  The  very  first  prerequisite  for  an 
intervention  to  be  considered  safe  enough  is  knowledge  about  its 
effectiveness  in  terms  of  potential  benefits,  and  about  potential  harms. 
There  must  be  scientific  evidence  that  the  technological  intervention 
contributes to the solution of the problem for which it is designed; and the 
robustness of this evidence needs to be assessed. The second prerequisite 
refers  to  the  ratio  between  risks  and  potential  benefits:  risks  must  not 
exceed benefits. 

3.2.1  ‘Safe enough’ in the context of somatic genome editing 

There  is  no  novelty  in  the  definition  of  ‘safe  enough’  in  genome  editing  of 
somatic  cells.  It  follows  the  same  ethical  conditions  recognised  by  the 
scientific  community  regarding  research  and  the  clinical  application  of 
interventions for therapeutic purposes, mainly the evaluation of risk/benefit 
proportionality  by  the  researcher,  the  ethics  committee,  and  the  physician 
together  with  the  patient,  respectively.  Furthermore,  the  informed  consent 
of the study participant or the patient is necessary.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Today,  laboratories  around  the  world  are  working  hard  to  develop  somatic 
gene  therapies,  taking  forward  work  that  has  been  ongoing  –  the  first 
somatic  gene  therapy  trials  were  conducted  decades  ago.  These  therapies 
target  genes  in  specific  types  of  cells  in  an  individual.  Modifications  of  the 
genetic material affect  only the patient and are assumed not to be passed 
on  to  future  generations.  Somatic  genome  editing  is  regulated  by  EU  laws 
and guidelines on gene therapy, such as those governing Advanced Therapy 
Medicinal Products (ATMP),56 and by national rules and regulations.  

The  EGE  welcomes  the  development  of  new  somatic  therapies,  but  it  does 
on  the  understanding  that  well-designed  clinical  trials  assessing  the  safety 
and benefits of the therapies are carried out before they are introduced on 
a  larger  scale,  that  the  risks  are  acceptable  in  relation  to  anticipated 
benefits,  and  that  there  is  an  absence  of  alternatives  (with  lower  risks). 
Long-term studies are important and are already foreseen under the ATMP 
Regulation.  Also  registries  are  imposed  when  gene  therapy  products  are 
authorised for the market.  

The  EGE  wants  to  stress  the  importance  of  specific  genome  editing 
expertise within ethics committees charged with approving and supervising 
such  activities  as  clinical  trials  or  the  use  of  therapies  involving  genome 
editing. These committees have the difficult task of determining, on a case-
by-case  basis,  when  genome  editing  is  warranted.  It  goes  without  saying 
that,  in  general,  ethics  committees  have  highly  competent  members,  but 
not  all  of  them  are  familiar  with  the  technical  aspects  of  genome  editing. 
Therefore,  it  could  be  considered  whether  specialist  bodies  should  make 
risk/benefit  determinations  on  a  project/case-specific  basis,  rather  than 
leaving  those  determinations  to  research  ethics  committees,  which  are 
generalist and may not have the expertise to make these assessments. For 
medicines,  the  Clinical  Trial  Regulation  lays  down,  that  “Member  States 
shall ensure that the assessment is done jointly by a reasonable number of 
the  necessary  qualifications  and 
persons  who  collectively  have 
experience.”57  However,  there 
for  different  organisational 
approaches to fulfil this requirement.

‘Safe enough’ in the context of DIY genome editing 

A benefit/risk-analysis is more difficult the more institutional frameworks of 
clinical research and healthcare are left behind so that existing governance 
frameworks do not apply. This is true for so called ‘do-it-yourself kits’ (DIY 
kits) for genome editing that have been commercially offered by promoters 
of  the  so-called  ‘bio-hacking’  movement.  The  movement  presents  itself  as 
advocating  for  a  ‘democratisation’  and  acceleration  of  science  by  enabling 
‘anyone’  to  experiment  with  latest  biological  techniques.58  After  first  ‘at 
home’  use  cases  of  DIY  CRISPR  engineering  were  reported,  regulatory 
institutions  have  reacted  to  the  risks  of  private  experimentation  with 
genome editing tools.59 Existing EU legislation has been referred to,60 and in 
several  EU  Member  States  genome  editing  is  only  allowed  in  licensed 
laboratories, implying that DIY applications are prohibited.61  

In  2017,  the  European  Centre  for  Disease  Prevention  and  Control  (ECDC) 
recommended  that  national  authorities  review  their  authorisation  of 
commercial DIY kits.62 In a 2017 Communication outlining an Action Plan to 
enhance preparedness against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear 
security  risks,  the  European  Commission  warned  that  “[c]ommercially 
available  ‘do-it-yourself’  bio-kits  make  it  possible  for  a  user  to  produce 
genetically  modified  microorganisms.  Progress  in  this  area  may  lead  to 
intentional  attack  or  accidental  contamination  with  modified  viruses  or 
bacteria.”63 Beyond security concerns  of this kind, DIY genome  editing kits

Centre for Disease Prevention and Control referred to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European 
Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  12  March  2001  on  the  deliberate  release  into  the

raise  ethical  questions  around,  for  instance,  naturalness,  biodiversity, 
humanness, safety and responsibility.  

Yet,  bio-hacking  comes  in  many  forms  and  researchers  have  found 
European  DIY  bioengineering  activities  to  involve  serious  initiatives  of 
citizen  science,  activism  and  art,  with  their  initiators  often  operating  in 
collaboration  with  universities  and  on  the  basis  of  ethics  codes.64  A  better 
understanding  of  the  current  situation,  through  studies  of  more  recent 
developments  around  DIY  genome  editing  activities  and  existing  and 
possible governance tools, would be an important step towards establishing 
how  a  clear  and  coherent  European  regulatory  approach  to  it  should  be 
developed.  It  is  without  doubt  that  regulation  is  necessary  as  an 
unregulated use of DIY genome editing tools can clearly be hazardous.  

3.2.2  ‘Safe enough’ in the context of heritable genome editing 

A much bigger problem is the definition of ‘safe enough’ in genome editing 
on  human  embryos  for  reproductive  purposes,  so-called  ‘heritable’  human 
genome  editing.  There  is  (almost)  unanimous  consensus  that,  at  the 
moment,  genome  editing  for  reproductive  purposes  is  far  from  being  safe 
enough  for  application  (e.g.  mosaicism,  off-  and  on-target  effects). 
However,  several  interdisciplinary  ethics  councils  and  other  bodies  have 
already discussed its potential future application. The WHO expert panel 65 is 
currently preparing guidance  on this, and the International Commission on 
the Clinical Use of Human Germline Genome Editing released its consensus 
study report in September 2020.66 

The  proportionality  of  benefit  in  terms  of  preventing  a  serious  genetically 
transmitted  disorder  has  to  be  balanced  with  the  risk  not  only  of  not 
correcting  the  genetic  defect  but  also  of  introducing  unintentional 
modifications  that  could  have  serious  implications  for  the  child  and  future 
generations  –  perhaps  even  more  serious  than  the  one  that  should  be 
prevented.  The  proportionality  of  potential  benefits  and  risks  differs  with 
regard to the aim of the intervention.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Before the technology can be proven ‘safe enough’, also only in biomedical 
terms a lot of research is required. Specific to this kind of research is that 
hundreds  and  thousands  of  human  embryos  may  have  to  be  used  and 
discarded.  This  alone  is  ethically  condemned  and  illegal  in  some  Member 
States,  whereas  others  allow  research  on  embryos  up  to  14  days  of  their 
development.  Some  scholars  also  hold  that  this  research  is  ethically 
required in order to prevent harm for future children through disorders that 
could possibly be avoided. However, in view of the EU subsidiarity principle 
governing legislation on human embryo research, the EGE holds back with a 
recommendation on this issue. 

There  are  a  number  of  values  and  concepts  and  value-laden  criteria  that 
determine what kinds of risks and what level of probability and severity of a 
harm  may  challenge  the  ‘safe  enough’  criterion.  Libertarian  theories  are  in 
favour  of  ‘procreative beneficence’, justifying even a risky intervention if it 
is  intended  to  provide  the  best  possible  conditions  for  the  child  and 
reproductive  self-determination.67  Other 
acknowledging 
theories,  in  contrast,  defend  the  right  of  the  child  to  be  born  without  any 
intentional genome editing.68 

its  parents’ 

Another  central  proportionality  question  is  posed  by  the  availability  of 
for  avoiding  heritable 
technological  alternatives  to  genome  editing 
disorders,  such  as  preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  and  donation  of 
gametes  (yet,  those  raise  other  ethical  questions).  Only  few  reproductive 
constellations  exclude  all  strategies  but  genome  editing  to  ensure  that  a 
child  is  born  without  a  disorder.  This  is  the  case,  for  example,  if  both 
parents  are  carriers  of  two  alleles  of  a  recessive  disorder,  so  that  every 
embryo  can  only  inherit  disease-causing  alleles.  Are  research  on  embryos 
and  the  risk  of  harm  caused  by  the  technology  ethically  acceptable  and 
proportionate for the few cases for which there is no alternative? 

Another  ethical  challenge  consists  in  the  scenario  of  some  children  being 
born  with  technologically  induced  disorders  because  the  technology  is,  at 
some  point,  meant  to  be  safe  enough  and  put  forward  to  clinical  studies. 
Some  see  this  as  an  instrumentalisation  of  these  embryos  and  children, 
thus  violating  their  dignity.  In  any  such  case,  life-long  and  multi-
generational  monitoring  would  be  necessary  in  order  to  gain  insight  into 
long-term  effects  on  the  biological,  psychological  and  social  level.  Which

implications  and  risks  would  these  life-long  studies  mean  for  the  person 
concerned and their relatives and social environment? 

In  light  of  the  variety  of  ethical  challenges  posed  by  heritable  human 
genome  editing,  inclusive  societal  debate  is  necessary.  A  broad  societal 
consensus  is  precondition  for  the  reproductive  use  of  human  genome 
editing  to  be  considered.  Societal  engagement  with  it  must  be  well-
informed and be based on an awareness that the accumulation of individual 
choices, as also elicited by competitive societies and hidden (or not hidden) 
market  forces,  could  result  in  heritable  human  genome  modification  that 
may change the society itself. Public engagement should involve a range of 
publics, scientists, scholars in the social sciences and humanities, ethicists,

4  GENOME EDITING IN ANIMALS 

Ethics of Genome Editing 

4.1  Introduction  

Animals71 can be considered in two different ways: in an instrumental one, 
and in terms of their intrinsic value. Sacrificing animals for human interests 
is common practice today, although it is far from ethically neutral. Different 
perspectives  exist  on  the  acceptability  of  farming  and  eating  animals,  as 
that  animal 
well  as  of  animal  experimentation.  Critics  argue 
experimentation 
the  kind  of 
is  morally  unjustified,  regardless  of 
experimentation,  its  purpose  or  potentials;  many  others  accept  animal 
experiments under strict conditions. A set of principles, ‘the three Rs’ (3Rs), 
standing for replacement, reduction and refinement, has become a broadly 
accepted tool to strike a balance between enabling animal experiments and 
respecting animals.72  

Against  this  background,  we  have  identified  two  main  domains  of 
application  of  genome  editing  that  are  relevant  with  regard  to  EU 
competencies  and  regulation.  The  first  relates  to  genome  editing  in 
experimentation implying the use of animals, including their ‘humanisation’. 
Among  the  many  fields  of  application  of  genome  editing  in  animal 
experimentation, this chapter provides ethical reflection on experimentation 
for  research  on 
with  non-human  primates, 
xenotransplantation  and  the  potential  consequences  of  genome  editing  on 
the  3Rs.  The  second  domain  of  application  that  this  chapter  will  consider 
relates to genome editing in animal farming. 

the  use  of  animals 

In  addition  to  ethical  concerns  in  relation  to  biosafety  and  biosecurity,  the 
rapid  increase  and  deployment  of  genome  editing  techniques  for  various 
applications  poses  the  challenge  of  determining  a  consensus  on  the 
conditions  and  boundaries  of  acceptability  of  genetically  modifying  animals 
for both livestock breeding and research, in light of animal welfare concerns 
and animal dignity, especially when non-human primates are involved. 

The  EGE  acknowledges  that  other  areas  of  genome  editing  in  animals 
require  ethical  reflection  as  well,  such  as  genome  editing  in  pets,  the 
potential  of  a  respective  industry  emerging  and  related  questions  on  the 
intrinsic value of animals and their instrumental value for humans. 

71 Hereby non-human animals are meant.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

A use of genome editing in animals that has recently drawn attention is the 
case  of  gene  drives,  i.e.  the  possibility  to  drive  the  biased  inheritance  of 
certain genes into entire animal or insect populations (e.g. pests) to  make 
them  harmless  or  more  vulnerable.  Gene  drives  appear  to  offer  a  broad 
scope  of  application,  such  as  eliminating  insect-borne  human  diseases, 
developing  and  supporting  more  sustainable  agricultural  models,  and 
controlling  environmentally  damaging  invasive  species.73  Ethical  questions 
around gene drives are explored in a dedicated chapter (6. Gene drives). 

Theoretically,  genome  editing  could  also  be  used  to  reintroduce  extinct 
animal  species  or  restore  populations  of  endangered  animal  species.  Using 
genome  editing  for  these  purposes  is  a  niche  application  that  is  still  in  an 
exploratory  research  phase  and  requires  careful  analysis  of  potential 
consequences before being considered in practice.74  

Generally  speaking,  many  issues  and,  indeed,  values  that  have  been 
discussed  in  the  context  of  the  use  of  animals  by  humans,  irrespective  of 
genome  editing  technologies,  arise  with  genome  editing,  reviving  and 
exacerbating ‘old’ questions such as: What is the intrinsic value of animals? 
In what is it, or not, different from that of humans? Is there a hierarchy in 
the value of different animals? How do we define animal welfare? What do 
we mean by respect and rights for animals? 

4.2  Animal experimentation 

The use of animals and specifically vertebrates, among them mammals, has 
been  debated  for  a  long  time  and  has  led  to  the  development  of  strong 
regulation, with requirements for due justification, considering purpose and 
necessity,  animal  welfare,  conditions  to  be  ensured,  among  them  those  to 
avoid animal suffering, minimise it and end it when present according to set 
criteria  and  methods.  There  are  many  guidelines  on  the  use  of  animals  in 
research and since 1986 a dedicated EU Directive addresses the protection 
of animals used for scientific purposes (revised in 2010).75 In line with this

Directive,  the  European  Commission  publishes  reports  on  statistics  about 
the use of animals for scientific purposes in the EU.  

The  first  and  most  recent  report  indicated  an  overall  number  of  animals 
used  for  research  and  testing  of  between  9.4  and  9.8  million  per  year 
between  2015  and  2017.76  The  number  of  animals  used  for  the  first  time 
(‘naïve  animals’)  for  the  creation  and  maintenance  of  genetically  altered 
animal lines  to  meet  the  research  needs  in  the  EU  amounts  to  around  1.2 
million.  Species  of  particular  public  concern  (dogs,  cats  and  non-human 
primates) represented less than 0.3% of the total number of animals used 
in 2017. Between 2015 and 2017, the numbers of non-human primates saw 
an increase of 15%. There are also animals that are purpose-bred for use in 
science, and dispatched without having been used, in order to ensure what 
is  indicated  as  required  numbers  and  quality  of  animals  to  support  EU 
research.77 Information on animals bred, not used and dispatched identifies 
those as a result of the creation of new genetically altered animal lines (525 
085 in 2017) and of the maintenance of existing lines (5 588 196 in 2017). 

4.2.1  Genome editing in research animals 

The  animal  genome  has  been  manipulated  by  humans,  directly  or  by 
breeding,  for  decades,  but  CRISPR/CasX  in  particular,  has  given  new 
impetus  to  using  animal  models  for  different  purposes.78  A  UK  report 
indicated that “animal use in science started declining in the mid-1970s, at 
least  in  the  United  Kingdom,  resulting  in  a  drop  in  the  number  of  animals 
used approaching 50% between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s.”79 Yet, this 
development  was  reversed  with  the  advent  of  genetically  modified 
animals.80 Fifteen years ago, it took a geneticist close to a year to introduce 
a  gene  into  an  animal.  Since  then,  the  use  of  genome  edited  animals  in 
research  on  human  health  has  strongly  developed.  Today  genome  editing

can, for example, be applied directly to DNA in reproductive cells, say, of a 
mouse, producing a new mouse in just three weeks.81 

Given  the  potential  of  genome  editing  and  the  width  of  possible 
applications,  one  risk  is  that  it  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  overall  use  of 
animals for experimentation, even if in line with ‘the 3Rs rule’ (replacement, 
reduction,  refinement)  the  number  of  animals  is  kept  to  a  minimum  for 
each  single  experiment.  But  ease  of  use  should  not  lead  to  less  rigour,  on 
the contrary. The study of specific gene modifications with greater precision 
and the creation of refined animal models of human diseases, for example, 
neurodegenerative  diseases  such  as  Huntington  disease  or  Parkinson 
disease,  are  two  areas  where  genome  editing  is  offering  new  insights.82 
Overall,  this  new  generation  of  genome  editing  technologies  allows 
scientists  to  modify  the  genomes  of  animals  more  efficiently,  more 
meaningful  experiments  are  possible  (basic  and  translational),  and 
experiments become possible that were impossible before83 – although off-
target effects still exist and need to be recognised and understood. CRISPR 
has  generated  significant  excitement,  having  “swept  through  labs  around 
the world” at a “breakneck pace [that] leaves little time for addressing the 
ethical  and  safety  concerns  such  experiments  can  raise.”84  What  does  this

of  this  new  technique?  Is  the  widespread  use  of  genome  editing  in  animal 
research likely to reverse efforts to reduce the number of animals used for 
research  purposes?  Will  its  use  require  to  review  our  commitments  to 
research animals?

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Work on animal models is often a pre-requisite to human applications or is 
done  with  the  objective  of  comparing  between  animals  and  humans  (e.g. 
the OncoMouse in cancer  research), and genome editing has improved the 
processes  for  this.  Yet,  “while  it  is  commonly  and  frequently  claimed  that 
genome  editing  has  become  significantly  (perhaps  radically)  quicker, 
cheaper, more efficient, easier to use, and therefore more accessible, care 
is  needed  when  interpreting  these  claims.”87  Similarly,  it  has  been 
suggested  that  “progress  has  often  been  technically  challenging  […].  ES 
(Embryonic Stem) cells have not been obtained for most species and, even 
in  mice,  where  the  technology  is  relatively  refined,  it  is  time-consuming, 
expensive,  variable,  often  highly  inefficient,  and  requires  a  special  skill 
set.”88 

Likewise,  genome  editing  is  being  developed  also  for  animal  health  and 
veterinary science. Protocols should be rigorously and critically assessed in 
all areas of application. 

4.2.1.1 Genome editing in xenotransplantation research 

Because of organ donor shortage, transplantation of organs from animals to 
humans has been considered for a long time. Yet, xenotransplantation faces 
numerous difficulties. One of these relates to finding appropriate sources of 
organs.  Pigs  have  been  found  to  be  the  most  suitable  since  the  1980s,  in 
terms of their organs’  size and the ease of raising them, while non-human 
primate organs are too small for adult humans. Another difficulty relates to 
overcoming  problematic  human  immune  system  reactions,  which  could 
partly  be  resolved  by  manipulating  certain  pig  genes  that  code  molecules 
triggering  these  reactions  (indeed,  in  the  1990s  pigs  with  alpha  1,3-
galactosyl  transferase  gene-knockout  were  created).89  A  third  challenge 
relates  to  the  endogenous  pig  retrovirus,  the  Porcine  Endogenous 
Retrovirus  (PERV),  which  could  infect  human  cells  and  unleash  a  deadly 
human  epidemic.90  This  risk  stopped  nearly  all  industrial  developments  in 
the field of xenotransplantation at the beginning of the 21st century.91  

Nevertheless,  xenotransplantation  kept  being  researched,  with  more 
porcine  sugars  and  key  antigens  having  been  identified  and  pigs  without

them  created.92  The  possibilities  offered  by  genome  editing  now  open  new 
perspectives  for  this  area.  In  2017,  researchers  used  the  CRISPR/CasX 
system to inactivate 62 PERV genes in pig cells and created embryos  from 
these  foetal  cells.  None  from  the  resulting  37  piglets  showed  any  trace  of 
the PERV virus.93  

Genome  editing thus revives the genetic modification of large animals that 
can  serve  as  sources  for  xenotransplants  to  treat  organ  losses  or 
in  humans.94  One  approach  to  testing  transplantation 
dysfunctions 
outcomes  and  mechanisms  is  xenotransplantation  of  animal  organs  into 
non-human  primates,  meaning  that  research  on  xenotransplantation  can 
also increase the use of non-human primates for research. 

Another  route  pursued  in  biomedical  research  on  organ  (re)generation  is 
the creation of human organs from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in animal 
foetuses. For this purpose, animal foetuses deficient in one or more specific 
organs  are  created  to  use  the  ‘empty  space(s)’  for  the  growth  of  induced 
PSCs  and,  ultimately,  organs.95  The  resulting  pig-derived  donor  organ  is 
identical  with  the  organ  of  the  host.  This  means  that  humanised  pig 
embryos  can  be  created  and  frozen  to  ‘save’  personalised  ‘libraries’  or 
banks  for  the  case  of  organ  failure.  Among  other  ethical  concerns,  the 
‘personalised  pig’  raises  obvious  questions  as  to  ‘who  can  afford  this’  –  a 
recurring  problem  in  the  ethics  of  biotechnological  innovation,  as  well  as 
questions  around  the  humanisation  of  animals,  i.e.  enhancing  traits  in 
animals that are considered to be exclusively or typically human. 

A  related  strategy  currently  explored  in  biomedical  research  is  the 
generation  of  stem-cell  generated  organoids  in  animals  and  in  vitro.

reduce  the  number  of  animals  needed  and  the  harm  caused  to  them,  but 
“should not be seen as a morally neutral alternative.”96

4.3  Genome editing in livestock breeding 

Genome  editing  applications  in  farm  animals  largely  serve  the  same  goals 
as  selective  breeding  practices,  namely,  to  increase  yields,  strengthen 
disease  resistance  and  improve  product  quality.97  To  date,  genome  editing 
tools  have  been  successfully  applied  to  a  wide  variety  of  farm  animals, 
including swine, cattle, sheep and goats.98 Examples of such applications of 
genome editing in farm animals are the CD163 genome edited pig, resistant 
to  porcine  reproductive  and  respiratory  syndrome,  and  the  SP110  gene 
knock-in cow, less susceptible to tuberculosis. The claims of benefits include 
advantages  for  both  animals  and  farmers:99  Genome  editing  to  modify  the 
susceptibility  of  animals  to  diseases  (e.g.  African  swine  fever  or  Porcine 
reproductive  and  respiratory  syndrome)  could  prevent  diseases  in  farm 
animal  populations  and  thus  avoid  animal  suffering,  medical  treatment  of 
animals (e.g. with antibiotics), culling of diseased animals and the resulting 
vast economic losses for the farmers. The introduction of the hornless gene 
of  Black  Angus  cattle  into  that  of  Holstein-Friesian  dairy  cows  was 
presented  as  an  example  for  the  possible  prevention  of  injuries  and 
suffering of farm animals. Genome editing has also been applied to poultry 
and to salmons.100  

The EGE underlines that considerations from its Opinion n°23 from 2008 on 
Ethical aspects of animal cloning for food supply can also be applied to the 
application  of  genome  editing  in  livestock.101  These  include  reflections  and 
recommendations  on  animal  welfare,  biodiversity,  sustainability  and  the 
necessity of an unbiased public dialogue.

4.4  Current European regulation  

4.4.1  Regulation of genome editing in research animals 

Animal welfare is a value of the Union that is enshrined in Article 13 of the 
Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union,  as  recited  in  Directive 
2010/63 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.102 Recital 
12 of the Directive also states, “Animals have an intrinsic value which must 
be  respected.  There  are  also  the  ethical  concerns  of  the  general  public  as 
regards the use of animals in procedures. Therefore, animals should always 
be  treated  as  sentient  creatures  and  their  use  in  procedures  should  be 
restricted to areas which may ultimately benefit human or animal health, or 
the  environment.  The  use  of  animals  for  scientific  or  educational  purposes 
should  therefore  only  be  considered  where  a  non-animal  alternative  is 
unavailable.  Use  of  animals  for  scientific  procedures  in  other  areas  under 
the competence of the Union should be prohibited.”103 

Article 3 of Directive 2010/63/EU defines ‘procedure’ as “any use, invasive 
or non-invasive, of an animal for experimental or other scientific purposes, 
with known or unknown outcome (…) which may cause the animal a level of 
pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm  equivalent to,  or higher than, that 
caused  by  the  introduction  of  a  needle  in  accordance  with  good  veterinary 
practice.  This  includes  any  course  of  action  intended,  or  liable,  to  result in 
the  birth  or  hatching  of  an  animal  or  the  creation  and  maintenance  of  a 
genetically modified animal line in any such condition (…).”104 

According to Article 5 such procedures may be carried out for the following 
purposes  only:  “(a)  basic  research;  (b)  translational  or  applied  research 
with  any  of  the  following  aims:  (i)  the  avoidance,  prevention,  diagnosis  or

The  Directive  also  contains  specific  measures  regarding  non-human 
primates. Article 8(1)  states that “specimens of non-human primates shall 
not be used in procedures, with the exception of those procedures meeting 
the  following  conditions:  (a)  the  procedure  has  one  of  the  following 
purposes:  (i)  translational  or  applied  research  undertaken  with  a  view  to 
the  avoidance,  prevention,  diagnosis  or  treatment  of  debilitating  or 
potentially life- threatening clinical conditions in human beings, or (ii) basic 
research  or  research  aimed  at  preservation  of  the  species  and  (b)  there  is 
scientific justification to the effect that the purpose of the procedure cannot 
be  achieved  by  the  use  of  species  other  than  non-human  primates.  A 
debilitating  clinical  condition  for  the  purposes  of  this  directive  means  a 
reduction  in  a  person’s  normal  physical  or  psychological  ability  to 
function.”106 

According  to  Article  8(3)  “great  apes  shall  not  be  used  in  procedures, 
subject  to  the  use  of  the  safeguard  clause  in  Article  55(2).”107  This  article 
provides that “[w]here a Member State has justifiable grounds for believing 
that  action  is  essential for  the  preservation  of  the  species  or  in  relation  to 
an unexpected outbreak of a life-threatening or debilitating clinical condition 
in  human  beings,  it  may  adopt  a  provisional  measure  allowing  the  use  of 
great  apes  in  procedures  having  one  of  the  purposes  referred  to  in  points 
(b)(i),  (c)  or  (e)  of  Article  5,  provided  that  the  purpose  of  the  procedure 
cannot  be  achieved  by  the  use  of  species  other  than  great  apes  or  by  the 
use  of  alternative  methods.”108  It  is  worth  noting  that,  since  the  Directive 
took effect in January 2013, no such safeguard clause has been initiated in 
the EU. 

4.4.2  Regulation  of  genome  editing  in  farm  animals  and

as a result of accommodation, food or transport conditions.109 Twelve years 
later,  in  1998,  at  the  level  of  the  European  Union  the  Council  Directive 
98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes 110 
established  common  minimum  standards  for  the  protection  of  animals  on 
farms,  as  well  as  specific  regulations  for  certain  species  and  farming 
methods. Although these legal efforts to protect the welfare of farm animals 
have  been  criticised  by  animal  defenders  to  not  meet  required  standards, 
they confirm that the wellbeing of farm animals is a socially shared concern 
and goal, recognised as such by European institutions. 

In  addition,  and  as  mentioned  above,  research  on  genome  editing  in 
livestock  animals,  also  if  for  the  purposes  of  ‘improving’  animals  for  food 
production,  does  fall  under  the  scope  of  Directive  2010/63/EU  on  the 
protection of animals used for scientific purposes. 

A  relevant  interpretation  of  the  legislation  that  is  expected  to  have  an 
impact on research on genome editing in animals (as well as in plants) and 
on the commercialisation of relevant applications in Europe is the judgment 
of  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union  of  25  July  2018  in  Case  C-
528/16.111 According to this judgment, organisms obtained by mutagenesis 
techniques  are  genetically  modified  organisms  (GMOs)  within  the  meaning 
of  Directive  2001/18/EC  on  the  deliberate  release  of  genetically  modified 
organisms  into  the  environment  (the  ‘GMO  Directive’),112  and  only 
organisms  obtained  by  mutagenesis  techniques  which  have  conventionally 
been  used  in  a  number  of  applications  and  have  a  long  safety  record  are 
excluded  from  the  scope  of  the  Directive.  Based  on  the  Court’s 
interpretation, new genome editing techniques, including CRISPR/CasX, are 
thus subject to the obligations laid down by the GMO Directive.

4.5  Key ethical questions and concerns related to genome 

editing in animals  

The  ethics  of  genome  editing  of  animals  can  be  considered  from  two 
perspectives,  or  on two levels: the one of an instrumental use of genome-
edited animals for purposes of human benefit, from human health to food; 
and the welfare of animals with respect to their intrinsic value. The EGE is, 
however, also aware  of the problematic nature of this distinction, with any 
discussion  about  animal  welfare  positioning  humans  as  guardians,  with 
power  over  them.  In  other  words,  even  taking  this  perspective  can  be 
problematic as we cannot escape our human viewpoint. 

Many  questions  raised  by  genome  editing  revive  older,  general  questions 
about the instrumentalisation of animals, for example concerning their mass 
production  or  the  use  of  non-human  primates  in  experimentation.  In  this 
context,  one  could either  consider the novel elements that genome  editing 
brings  to  the  discussion  of  these  questions  and  engage  in  targeted  ethical 
reflection on those; or revive these older questions considering that a new 
technique might shed new light on them in their general nature, beyond the 
concrete technical innovation that it introduces. The EGE considers that the 
genome editing debate offers an opportunity to reconsider present practices 
globally,  and  this  should  not  be  neglected  or  avoided  fearing  a  risk  of  ‘not 
moving forward’. 

Thus,  although  some  of  these  questions  go  beyond  what  can  be  fully 
analysed in this Opinion, the EGE calls attention to: 

  our  relationship  with  non-human  animals  and,  as  part  of  this,  our 
practices  to  ‘design  animals’  to  fit  the  environment  as  we  are 
‘engineering’ it, opposed to an understanding of the environment shaping 
(us)  animals  over  time,  involving  sustainable  practices  of  mutual 
adaptation and care;  

  animal rights, animal ethics, and a wider related literature, attempt  – or 
warn  against  –fitting  animals  into  our  general  ethical  frameworks,  a 
situation that might be further enriched in view of our evolving scientific 
understanding  of  animal  cognition  and  emotions,  and  in  view  of  the 
human publics’ evolving sensitivities; 

  the  various  levels  of  concern  at  play:  those  that  pertain  to  human 

welfare, to species, or to ecosystems in their entirety.  

On  this  basis,  the  EGE  identified  a  series  of  key  questions  with  regard  to 
genome editing in animals. Does genome editing affect the implementation 
of  the  3Rs  and  the  balance  among  the  three  principles?  Does  it,  for

example,  contribute  to  refinement,  at  the  expense  of  reduction?  What  are 
the  implications  of  and  which  should  be  the  limits  to  ‘humanisation’  of 
animals?  Are  there  specific  requirements  for  the  use  of  genome  editing  in 
non-human  primates,  beyond  those  already  established?  In  what  way  is 
animal  welfare  in  farming  fostered  or  hampered  by  genome  editing  and 
what  criteria  should  control  its  application?  Can  genome  editing  increase 
both  animal  welfare  and  efficiency  in  farming?  What  are  the  broader 
implications of genome editing for biodiversity? 

4.5.1  Genome editing and the 3Rs  

One lens of analysis is offered by the question as to whether the framework 
established  by  the  3Rs  to  protect  animals  in  experimentation  requires 
review in face of new genome editing techniques.  

4.5.1.1 REPLACEMENT 

On the one hand, genome editing helps to overcome technical and financial 
obstacles  to  animal  research.113  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  possible  that 
genome  editing  will  offer  opportunities  to  replace  animal  experimentation 
with  laboratory  methods  that  do  not  require  the  use  of  living  animals.114 
Genome  editing  techniques  can,  for  example,  be  used  to  replace  standard 
laboratory-grown  animal  model  organisms  by  generating  cell  lines  with 
specific characteristics that provide disease models. These can then be used 
to investigate pathologies and evaluate potential medicines before they are 
considered for trials and use in animals and humans.115  

Another possibility to replace animals in research is the creation of organoid 
models  using  new  genome  editing  techniques.  Their  development  is 
becoming increasingly sophisticated,116 making them a promising technique 
for  a  wide  variety  of  scientific  and  clinical  purposes,  including  in 
developmental biology, disease modelling, drug development, and precision 
and  regenerative  medicine.117  Although  unable  to  substitute  the  use  of 
animals, “organoids provide an additional screening step between cell-lines

and animal models meaning fewer potential therapies and interventions will 
move on to testing in animal models and a higher rate of success in those 
animals.”118 Scientists even expressed concerns about further developments 
in  organoid  and  synthetic  tissue  technology  potentially  placing  a  greater 
onus  on  scientists  to  carefully  justify  their  requirement  for  animal 
experimentation.119 “Of course, the development  and functioning of organs 
within a greater whole, a physiological system, cannot be replicated without 
using whole animals. But in this context, genome editing has made almost 
any  organism  amenable  to  genetic  manipulation  and  may  result  in 
mammals being more readily replaced by simpler organisms, if scientifically 
appropriate.”120 

4.5.1.2 REDUCTION 

to 

reduce 

in  our  attempts 

It  has  been  stated  that  the  impact  of  genome  editing  might  be  “most 
apparent 
in 
experimentation.”121  Reduction  can  be  defined  as  obtaining  the  same 
amount  of  data  with  less  animals,  or  obtaining  more  data  with  the  same 
amount of animals. It implies the use of methods that minimise the number 
of animals used per experiment, which includes appropriately designed and 
analysed  animal  experiments  that  are  robust  and  reproducible,  and  truly 
add to the knowledge base.122 

the  use  of  animals 

However,  there  appears  to  be  potential  for  both  reduction  and  increase 
through genome editing. CRISPR/CasX means that, for example, fewer mice 
are  likely  to  be  required  to  establish  a  given  line.123  However,  the  relative 
efficacy  and  ease  of  use  of  CRISPR/CasX  mean  that  more  researchers  are 
likely  to  use  it  to  research  questions  in  whole  animals  in  ways  that  were 
previously,  technically, beyond  their  reach.  This  might increase  the  overall 
number  of  animal  experiments  performed,  which  might  in  turn  mean 
decreased animal use relative to the rate of knowledge production, but also 
an  increased  rate  of  experimentation  and  increased  risk  of  poorly  planned 
or  coordinated  research.124  For  example,  genome  editing  techniques  might 
allow specific diseases that animals would naturally not contract or develop

to  be  investigated  in  animals.  This  would  increase  animal  suffering  in  the 
form of new disease models.  

It  has  also  been  pointed  to  the  fact  that  these  distinct  ethical  issues, 
“minimising  per-experiment  use  versus  minimising  overall  use,”  might  not 
always  be  “kept  separate”  and  that  it  is  unclear  “what  attitudes  exist 
towards them amongst the wider public.”125 

4.5.1.3 REFINEMENT  

Refinement relates to minimising animal suffering through the advancement 
of  studies  on  research  animal  welfare  “by  exploiting  the  latest  in  vivo(126) 
technologies  and  by  improving  understanding  of  the  impact  of  welfare  on 
scientific outcomes.”127  

A  contribution  to  refinement  by  genome  editing  is  not  obvious.  Animal 
geneticists  “still  need  to  generate  embryos  for  microinjection  of  guide 
RNA/CasX/template  cocktails,  and  these  zygotes  still  need  to  be  delivered 
to pseudopregnant females. There is a drive to refine such procedures, for 
example,  by  developing  robust  non-surgical  embryo  transfer  techniques. 
But  these  refinements  (…)  are  not  specifically  affected  by  genome  editing 
methodologies.”128  There  also  is  a  need  to  be  able  to  characterise  the 
genetically altered animals in order to confirm the modification. This is still 
mostly  being  done  through  invasive  tissue  sampling  (punch,  tail  or  toe 
clipping)  and  non-invasive  techniques  need  to  be  developed.  In  order  to 
decrease  the  suffering  of  animals,  the  development  of  animals  with  an 
impaired ability to feel pain has also been advanced. However, no proof-of-
concept  experiment  has  been  done  on  animals  so  far,  and  “conducting 
these experiments may itself cause suffering.”129  

“CRISPR/CasX  is  making  it  much  more  feasible  to  quickly  introduce 
transgenes  of  known  copy  number  into  a  safe  harbour  (such  as  Rosa26) 
such that phenotypic consequences of transgene expression should be more 
predictable, also requiring fewer lines. More sophisticated approaches, such 
as the editing of specific non-coding elements that control gene expression 
in  a  stage-  and  cell  dependent  fashion,  promise  even  more  control  and 

125 Greenfield, A., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00335-017-9702-y 
126 “In vivo” refers to experimentation done in a whole organism, rather than in live isolated 

cells.

predictability over phenotype.”130 The use of induced or Cre-Lox genetically 
altered  animals,  for  which  the  onset  of  the  mutation,  especially  when 
harmful,  can  be  better  controlled,  is  another  example  of  science-based 
refinement. Thus, scientific refinement may lead to increased refinement in 
animal experimentation.131 

There are risks to the welfare of experimental animals also due to technical 
difficulties  in  the  use  of  genome  editing.  Off-target  mutations  may  lead  to 
loss  of  function  of  a  gene,  adverse  events,  or  even  fatal  abnormalities. 132 
They may  consequently cause the  “animals further pain and suffering, due 
to  the  off-target  effects,  and  death  as  they  succumb  to  adverse  off-target 
effects or are killed.”133  

On the other hand, genome editing could be used to decrease the suffering 
of  research  animals,  for  example,  by  decreasing  the  occurrence  of 
unwanted  genetic  effects.  Moreover,  it  was  argued  that  routine  genome 
editing  of  non-human  primates  could  come  within  reach,  substantially 
compromising  their  welfare  and  quality  of  life.134  It  has  to  be  added  here 
that all involved appear to agree that, in general, far too little data exist to 
reach  any  robust  conclusions  about  off-target  effects  associated  with 
CRISPR. 

“Authors  noted  that  genome  editing  could  decrease  animal  welfare  if 
somatic  cell  nuclear  transfer  (SCNT)  cloning  was  used  to  deliver  the 
nuclease-mediated  modifications;  SCNT  is  associated  with  embryonic 
losses,  postnatal  death  and  birth  defects.  Authors  also  mentioned  that 
genome  editing  could  result  in  off-target  mutations  or  unintended  effects, 
which could negatively affect animal health.”135 

“Indeed, increased scientific refinement here—the provision of much better 
models of disease-associated human genetic variation—can be viewed as an 
ethical  good  in  itself,  since  it  will  arguably  result  in  more  rapid  and 
significant advances in scientific understanding i.e., progress towards better 
treatments.  It  is  in  this  sense  that  research  itself  can  be  viewed  as  an 
ethical good.”136 However, genome editing could “lead humans to ignore the 
predicament of the animal and to accept negative effects on animal welfare

Ethics of Genome Editing 

for the sake of other goals, although this risk could be prevented by  using 
less  drastic  gene  drive  designs  and  using  them  to  promote  animal 
welfare.”137 

Thus, we find that with genome editing a possible new balance between the 
3Rs,  as  compared  to  what  is  usually  the  case,  might  appear.  Genome 
editing  can  contribute  significantly  to  refinement,  but  apparently  not  to 
reduction  overall.  Although  the  3Rs  are  considered  equally important,  how 
we  balance  them  does  sometimes  change  with  different  technologies.  One 
can  also  recall  that  the  addition  of  a  fourth  R  for  ‘Responsibility’  was 
proposed  by  Max  Planck,  in  line  with  the  concept  of  Responsible  Research 
and  Innovation.  In  the  context  of  genome  editing,  one  might  consider  a 
further R for ‘Recourse to innovative alternative strategies’, which would go 
beyond  refinement  and  which  would,  at  least  in  the  context  of  NHP 
research, require investment in alternative solutions. 

4.5.2  Humanisation  

The idea of the ‘humanisation’ of non-human animals is ambiguous and has 
several  dimensions:  it  may  imply  a  scientific/technical  rapprochement  of 
animals to humans, for example, changing animals’ receptor cells on organs 
to  human  ones  in  order  to  impact  immune  response,  or  knocking  out 
specific  genes,  or  changing  a  specific  gene  sequence  according  to  the 
human  equivalent.  Mice  carrying  a  human  gene  are,  for  example,  often 
referred to as ‘humanised mice’. Humanisation might also refer to scenarios 
of enhancing animals’ cognitive capacity to such an extent that the species 
categories or the distinction between human and animal become blurred (or 
new  ‘inter-species’  categories  are  created).  In  the  context  of  this  Opinion, 
we  are  particularly  concerned  with  the  crossing  of  lines  distinguishing 
species, not necessarily in a biological sense, but in so far as animals may 
gain  functions  or  characteristics  normally  attributed  to  humans.  What 
considerations  on  rights  and  obligations  are  brought  about  by  such 
scenarios?  

The  potential  to  change  the  nature  of  animals,  sometimes  referred  to  as 
‘de-animalisation’,  i.e.  to  add  or  remove  certain  capacities  from  animals 
(such as cognitive capacities or the ability to feel pain), is of ethical concern 
(see also section 4.5.3. on humanisation and non-human primates). In that 
regard, humanisation can also be understood as a form of de-animalisation.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Whether  one  considers  humanisation  or  de-animalisation,  the  purpose  of 
the related intervention is of key importance. 

A main concern identified with respect to non-human primates (aside from 
broader ethical questions around the use of primates  – and other animals) 
is the potential of genome editing research to humanise them.  

With regard to xenotransplantation research and its clinical application, the 
outlook  of  large-scale  farms  of  pigs  carrying  human  organs  raises  major 
concerns.  Among  them  are  concerns  around  animal  welfare  and  around 
humanisation,  but  also  the  potential  for  health  research,  funding  and 
resources to be directed by an increasing demand for  xenotransplantation, 
instead  of  investigating  and  addressing  the  root  causes  of  the  increasing 
need  for  organ  transplants.  It  could  be  an  expensive  and  potentially 
exclusive technical solution to a mostly societal problem. 

4.5.3  The ethics of genome editing in non-human primates  

A specific area of concern is the application of genome editing techniques in 
non-human  primates  (NHPs).  Singling  out  NHPs  is  justified  by  the 
recognition of their special social and cognitive capacities. The public debate 
has established the need of particular protection for the wellbeing of NHPs, 
reflected also by Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for 
scientific  purposes,  which  provides  specific  requirements  and  additional 
limitations  for  the  use  of  NHPs  in  research.  However,  the  EGE  is  aware  of 
the problematic implications of such a singling-out of NHPs.138  

Many of the moral considerations concerning genome  editing in plants and 
animals  in  terms  of  costs  and  benefits,  risks,  safety,  security,  efficiency, 
proportionality  and  responsibility,  discussed  in  this  opinion,  apply  in  some 
form  to  the  genetic  engineering  of  NHPs.  An  important  set  of  moral 
concerns  is  that  NHPs  are  too  much  seen  as  just  other  animals  and  that 
their specific morally relevant properties are not recognised. In this section 
we  focus  on  moral  considerations  that  are  specific  to  NHPs  as  we  endorse 
their specific status, already underlined in the current regulation.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

There  has  been  a  steady  increase  in  appreciation  of  the  moral  standing  of 
animals  in  general  and  NHPs  in  particular  in  recent  decades.  This  can  be 
seen  as  part  of  what  Peter  Singer  refers  to  ‘the  expanding  circle’  in  the 
course  of  human  history,  i.e.  the  expansion  of  the  set  of  entities  that  are 
given moral standing, either as moral agents or as moral patients.139 Peter 
Singer’s  work  on  animal  rights  has  had  great  impact  in  society  regarding 
our  thinking  about  the  moral  standing  of  animals.  His  radical  utilitarian 
views dislodged a dominant rationality-based view and replaced it by a view 
that  focuses  on  our  common  capacity  to  feel  pain  and  suffer.  A  range  of 
standards  seem  morally  required  of  human  beings in  their  interaction  with 
animals.  

Against this background, we need to look at the question of what we owe to 
NHPs over and above what we owe to other animals. Is there even a reason 
to  assume  that  some  of  the  types  of  moral  principles  that  apply  between 
human beings, apply to them as well? If this would be the case is it because 
we  have  morally  relevant  properties  in  common  with  them?  How  do  we 
identify this set of overlapping moral properties between humans and NHPs 
on which our moral judgments supervene? 

There were a number of developments in the last decades that have led to 
the  consensual  identification  of  sets  of  properties  for  determining  moral 
standing.  

First,  scientific  research  on  primate  cognition,  primate  behaviour  and 
evolutionary  biology  and  genomics  of  primates  and  humans,  has  brought 
even more striking similarities between us and them to light as is the case 
with  other  animals:  their    communication,  theory  of  mind,  self-awareness, 
pro-social  behaviour,  hunting  in  groups  and  foraging  collaboration;  they 
have  elaborate  social  ties,  in  addition  to  forming  pairs  and  family-type 
structures,  have  friends  with  whom  they  form  alliances  and  engage  in 
grooming, they assess  and reciprocate social actions, they  show  emotions, 
transmit  knowledge,  and  use  tools.  This  means  that  their  lives  may  go 
better or worse in these and other dimensions and they may have negative 
and  positive  experiences  accordingly,  which  are  observable.  Furthermore, 
genomic research indicates that we  share up to 99%  of the protein-coding 
genome.140 They are humans’ living nearest relative.  

This points to a more acute issue in NHPs than in other species, that is the 
‘humanisation’,  as  genome  editing  may  lead  to  (unforeseen  or  intended)

‘advanced  humanisations’  of  NHPs  as  compared  to  evolutionary  more 
distant  species.  Finally,  many  philosophers  have  been  following  Singer, 
Regan  and  others,  by  arguing  for  the  moral  standing  of  animals;  some  of 
these  views  build  on  the  work  of  primatologists,  such  as  Frans  de  Waal. 
Some calls for a ‘re-anthropomorphisation’ of our understanding of NHPs on 
scientific  and  methodological  grounds  and  propose  that  we  may  ascribe 
sorrow, grief, jealousy, shame, joy and anger to them. Some adopt a moral 
version of this line of reasoning (or run them together) and suggest that we 
disregard our humanity when we do not take our own emotional responses 
serious  to  their  grief  and  joy  and  suffering.  Lori  Gruen,  in  Entangled 
Empathy,  advocates  an  ethics  of  care  along  these  lines.141  Christine 
Korsgaard,  in  her  Fellow  Creatures,  advocates  expanding  a  Kantian 
approach to our thinking about animals. Her monograph is a defence of the 
claim  that  “we  human  beings  are  obligated  to  treat  all  sentient  animals, 
that  is,  all  animals  who  have  subjective  experiences  that  are  pleasant  or 
painful,  as  what  Kant  called  ‘ends-in-themselves’,  in  at  least  one  sense  of 
that notion.”142 That sense is the one in which being an ‘end-in-itself’ allows 
an  individual  to  have  moral  claims  on  us;  individuals  who  are  ‘ends-in-
themselves’  have  goals  and  means  of  accomplishing  such  goals  that 
obligate  us  to  constrain  how  we  humans  can  justifiably  act  toward  them. 
Martha  Nussbaum  wants  to  extend  her  capability  theory  to  justify  animal 
rights,143 and “develop a life-quality standard for animals based on generic 
categories  such  as  bodily  integrity  and  health,  which  emphasise  personal 
autonomy.  This  framework  could  be  used  to  shape  policies  that  protect 
animal  rights,  which  would  be  species-specific.  ‘If  the  human  list  (of 
capabilities) is a template for  constitution making, so too might be the list 
for each animal species,’ she said.”144 

What  these  philosophical  projects  show  is  that  very  prominent  proponents 
of  utilitarianism,  care  ethics,  Kantian  ethics  and  the  capability  approach 
have  tried  to  accommodate  considered  judgments  about  how  we  should 
deal  with  animals  into  ethical  theory.  Our  sensitivities  have  changed 
accordingly. This seems to suggest that we have an elaborate set of strong 
moral  obligations  towards  NHPs  that  moves  beyond  the  standard  3Rs 
methodology and standard ethics of animal experimentation.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Analysis  of  the  literature  at  this  stage  seems  to  suggest  that  experiments 
with NHPs are morally acceptable only if (1) serious human suffering can be 
prevented  by  carrying  out  scientific  research  on  primates,  that  can  in  no 
other way be alleviated, and (2) our way of dealing with the NHPs in these 
processes accommodates the wealth of scientific findings on their physical, 
mental  and  emotional  lives  and  the  modalities  of  their  wellbeing  and 
suffering. A third condition may be found in (3) a corollary obligation to find 
alternatives  to  experiments  and  genome  editing  with  harmful  phenotype 
expressions. A principle that could be entertained is that a budget should be 
reserved  and  spent  on  finding  alternative  methods  when  experiments  are 
carried out on NHPs. 

This  leaves  the  question  of  genome  editing  that  enhances  NHPs,  and 
especially  great  apes,  and  seeks  to  genetically  augment  their  cognitive  or 
physical capacities, without causing any harm and suffering beyond living in 
generous  and  suitable  free  range  conditions  of  captivity.  Arguments  of 
proponents  of  human  enhancement  (e.g.  Savulescu)  may  also  defend  the 
position  that  the  ability  to  make  NHPs  more  human  without  causing  pain 
and  suffering  would  translate  into  a  moral  obligation  to  do  so.  Not 
endorsing  such  positions,  any  stance  of  respecting  the  ‘animalness’  also 
leads  to  reject  the  fact  that  ‘making  them  more  human’  would  be  a 
desirable goal in itself.  

The  EGE  wishes  to  underline  that  much  of  the  argumentation  regarding 
NHPs relates to animals in general, and it is fair to recognise the high level 
of intelligence and self-awareness of other species (e.g. corvids).  

4.5.4  Genome editing and animal welfare in farming 

As  regards  farming  for  food  production,  we  acknowledge  that  as  a  society 
we instrumentalise animals and that there are serious moral problems with 
industrial  farming  and  the  mass  production  of  animals.  Commercial 
practices  of  pushing  farmed  animals  to  their  ‘biological  limit’  are  highly 
problematic and genome editing has the potential to facilitate or exacerbate 
them.  In  this  context,  the  EGE  refers  to  the  wider  discussion  on 
technological solutions as a presumed ‘quick fix’ to broad societal problems. 

As analysed, genome editing technologies may offer possibilities to improve 
both animal welfare in farming and productivity, but a number of questions 
remain open as we lack knowledge (for example, on off-target modification 
consequences)  and  large  societal  debates  on  the  matter.  What  should  be 

56  

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 

 
Ethics of Genome Editing 

the  limits  to  practices  of  genetically  modifying  animals?  Is  it  acceptable  to 
modify  an  animal  to  suit  its  breeding  environment,  or  to  improve  its 
wellbeing  by  altering  an  attribute  that  is  characteristic  of  its  species?  Is  it 
ethically appropriate to introduce into a local  population of wild animals or 
insects  a  gene  that  will  lead  to  its  elimination  (see  6.  Gene  drives)?  What 
are  purposes  for  which  the  use  of  the  CRISPR/CasX  system  is  acceptable? 
What level of uncertainty or certainty is required to refuse or to implement 
an application?  

4.5.5  Genome editing in animals and biodiversity 

As  for  all  processes  of  genetic  alteration,  utmost  prudence  is  necessary  as 
to  potential  consequences  of  genome  editing  applications  on  biodiversity, 
ecosystems  and  the  environment.  Genome  editing  technologies  applied  to 
animals may serve purposes of protection or recreation of diversity, or may 
endanger it if not appropriately controlled. We presently lack data, and we 
need to consider long-term time scales.  

Theoretically,  genome  editing  could  be  used  to  reintroduce  extinct  animal 
species or restore populations of endangered animal species. Using genome 
editing  for  these  purposes  is  a  niche  application  that  is  still  in  an 
exploratory research phase and should be considered with caution and with 
careful  analyses  of  potential  consequences  before  being  considered  in 
practice.145  

Given  the  relative  ease  to  produce,  with  new  genome  editing  techniques, 
new  characteristics  in  animals,  even  outside  the  usual  professional  and 
regulated  contexts  of  research  or  food  production,  governance  tools  that 
are  fit  for  purpose  must  regulate  it.  Gathering  information  on  progress  of 
knowledge  in  this  domain  and  transparency  vis  à  vis  publics  on  all  related 
matters are key.

5  GENOME EDITING IN PLANTS 

5.1  Introduction 

Plants are used for many purposes, including for providing food, feed, fibre 
and  fuel,  and  they  may  be  the  source  of  many  chemicals  used  by  human 
societies.  Technology  could  be  used  for  developing  new  uses  of  plants  not 
previously available, for example, the production of vaccines in tobacco. 

Most  reports addressing the use  of new techniques for  editing the genome 
have stressed their use in humans. The use of these technologies in plants 
is  more  likely  to  happen  quickly,  and  in  Europe  particularly,  may  be 
controversial.  Science  provides  almost  unlimited  power  to  modify  our 
environment. The problem is no longer as to what can be done, but rather 
what  should  be  done  (Philippe  Goujon).  The  economic  impact  of 
choosing  to  use  or  not  use  plants  produced  using  any  new 
technologies  is  likely  to  be  significant  and  should  be  addressed  by 
public authorities and society at large. 

“Throughout  history  humanity  has  transformed  and  adapted  to  the  world’s 
various  climates.  (…)  The  first  farmers  would  choose  the  seeds  of  plants 
that produced the most favourable traits, such as that with the most  fruit, 
to  plant  in  the  following  season.  Over  many  years,  this  selection  process 
produced  domesticated  plants  that  are  very  different  from  their  wild 
precursors.”146  Maize  (Zea  mays),  wheat  (Triticum  aestivum)  and  barley 
(Hordeum  vulgare)  bear little resemblance to the original plants. All of the 
vegetables in the figure below have been developed using natural selection 
over many generations from the same precursor.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

These vegetables have all been developed from the same precursor using natural 
selection over many generations. 

Deliberately  induced  mutations  using  chemicals  or  radiation  or  genetic 
modification by changes at random points within the genome of plants have 
been used for a long time to attempt to produce new (‘improved’) varieties 
of  plants.  In  addition,  techniques  like  embryo  rescue  or  the  production  of 
hybrids with related plants that could not normally occur (due, for example, 
to  flowering  at  different  times  of  the  year)  are  a  major  step  in  the 
production  of  new  varieties  suited  to  particular  environmental  conditions. 
Most  commercially  produced  plants  currently  cultivated  are  the  results  of 
deliberate  modification  and  subsequent  selection.  This  process  can  (and 
does) take considerable time. 

Most  of  the  plant  cells  modified  by  these  techniques  will  be  non-viable  or 
lacking  the  desired  characteristics.  However,  the  ability  to  regenerate 
(many)  whole  plants  from  a  single  cell  becomes  of  extreme  importance  in 
this  process,  which  has  always  required  selection  and  sexual  reproduction 
to  select  the  plants  which  have  ‘suffered  least’  from  the  modification 
process and which can then be grown as uniform and stable varieties. The 
plants  that  demonstrate  both  the  desired  modification  and  least  disruption

of  other  properties  would  be  selected.  This  is  an  important  step  in  the 
process  of  commercialising  new  varieties,  regardless  of  the  mechanism  of 
production of the variety – whether selection or modification using a range 
of technologies. 

New  varieties147 are  continuously being created that are better suited than 
current varieties to the local conditions or have desired agronomic or other 
desired  characteristics  –  to  meet  challenges  including  responding  to 
anticipated  consumer  choice,  longer  shelf  life  of  the  products  or  to  defeat 
weeds  and  pests.  The  effective  lifetime  of  a  new  variety  depends  on  the 
‘crop’  but  is  relatively  short,  sometimes  no  more  than  five  years.  Many  of 
the plants obtained using new genetic technologies may not be suitable for 
particular  agricultural  conditions  and  will  be  crossed  with  appropriate 
varieties to further improve that which is actually used in production.  

‘Traditional  techniques’  (including  mutagenesis)  for  producing  new  plant 
varieties  have  received  little  press  and  almost  universal  acceptance  within 
Europe.  They  are  not  fully  defined,  but  Annex  I  B  to  Directive  2001/18  on 
the  deliberate  release  into  the  environment  of  genetically  modified 
organisms148 
lists  those  organisms  which  are  not  subject  to  the 
requirements of the Directive, namely those obtained through mutagenesis 
and  cell  fusion,  subject  to  certain  conditions.  The  EU  Court  of  Justice  has 
recently  clarified  the  interpretation  of  the  legal  status  of  mutagenesis 
techniques  under  that  Directive,  by  ruling  that  organisms  obtained  by 
mutagenesis  techniques/methods  are  GMOs  within  the  meaning  of  the 
Directive,  and 
that  only  organisms  obtained  by  mutagenesis 
techniques/methods  which  have  conventionally  been  used  in  a  number  of 
applications  and  have  a  long  safety  record  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of 
the  Directive.149  Many  of  the  varieties  produced  using  the  exempted 
techniques are even acceptable for being labelled organic. Most EU Member 
States  have

resisted  using  varieties  produced  using 

147  To  meet  “plant  variety  rights”  rules  for  registration  as  a  new  variety,  the  modified  plants 
must  be  (i)  new,  (ii)  distinct  (where  they  are  clearly  distinguishable  from  other  known 
varieties),  (iii)  uniform  and  (iv)  stable  (characteristics  are  unchanged  after  repeated 
propagation).

The  United  Nations  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity151  requires  its 
contracting parties to “Establish or maintain means to regulate, manage or 
control  the  risks  associated  with  the  use  and  release  of  living  modified 
organisms  resulting  from  biotechnology  which  are  likely  to  have  adverse 
environmental  impacts  that  could  affect  the  conservation  and  sustainable 
use  of  biological  diversity,  taking  also  into  account  the  risks  to  human 
health”  (Article  8(g)),  and  to  address  the  needs,  firstly,  assisting  less 
developed  countries  in  providing  access  to  the  results  and  benefits  arising 
from  biotechnology,  and  secondly,  considering  whether  a  protocol  to  the 
Convention addressing the impact of living modified organisms was required 
(Article 19). 

The  Cartagena  Protocol  on  Biosafety152  was  adopted  on  29  January  2000, 
and  the  European  Union  ratified  it  on  27  August  2002.    The  Protocol 
outlines the risk assessments required for the trans-boundary movement of 
modified organisms, and specifically places the precautionary approach as a 
fundamental  concept  when  permitting  the  use  of  these  organisms.  The 
precautionary  approach  in  environmental  law  was  first  enunciated  in 
Principle  15  of  the  Rio  Declaration  on  Environment  and  Development153 
(1992): 

In  order  to  protect  the  environment,  the  precautionary  approach  shall  be 
widely  applied  by  States  according  to  their  capabilities.  Where  there  are 
threats  of  serious  or  irreversible  damage,  lack  of  full  scientific  certainty 
shall  not  be  used  as  a  reason  for  postponing  cost-effective  measures  to 
prevent environmental degradation. 

The  use  of  the  precautionary  approach  (or  principle)  has  had  a  significant 
impact on the choice not to use genetically modified plants in Europe, even 
though  there  is  little  evidence  of  serious  or  irreversible  damage  to  the 
widespread  use  of  these  crops  in  the  rest  of  the  world.  Whilst  there  are 
strong  proponents  of  the  use  of  precaution  in  order  to  protect  the 
environment,  others  argue  that  the  concept  has  been  used  as  a  vehicle  to 
stop  progress.  There  is  no  evidence  of  harm  to  the  environment  due 

recombinant  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA)  and  direct  injection  of  nucleic  acid  into  cells  or 
organelles,  or  b.  Fusion  of  cells  beyond  the  taxonomic  family,  that  overcome  natural

specifically to the introduction of new varieties, although changes in farming 
practice  made  possible  by  the  characteristics  of  new  varieties  have 
impacted  on  the  conservation  of  biodiversity  –  fields  being  larger  and  the 
absence of hedges are examples. 

Precaution  dictates  that  case-by-case  consideration  of  the  products  of 
genome  editing  and  of  their  use  in  particular  environments  is  required. 
Should  this  analysis  identify  both  risk  and  benefit  to  humans  and 
the environment? 

The  European  GMO  legislation  (particularly  Directive  2001/18154)  requires, 
in accordance with the Cartagena Protocol (to which the EU is bound), that 
a risk assessment be undertaken to assure that harm to the environment is 
avoided.  In  many  cases,  the  interpretation  of  the  legislation  within  most 
European  countries  is  that,  based  on  the  precautionary  principle,  the  risk 
may be too great. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), fulfilling its 
statutory  role,  has  considered  the  risks  for  most  of  such  organisms 
approved  in  other  jurisdictions  and  has  recommended  in  the  vast  majority 
of  cases  that  these  plants  are  safe  for  the  environment.  The  European 
Commission’s  Communication  on  the  precautionary  principle155  identifies  a 
set of criteria in implementing the principle, inter alia:  

  proportional to the chosen level of protection, 

  non-discriminatory in their application, 

  consistent with similar measures already taken, 

  based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or 
lack  of  action  (including,  where  appropriate  and  feasible,  an  economic 
cost/benefit analysis), 

  subject to review, in the light of new scientific data,  

  capable of assigning responsibility for producing the scientific evidence, 

  necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment. 

Where  a  change  in  the  genome  involves  many  new  protein  and  enzyme 
genes  (synthetic  biology),  or  where  the  position  of  changes  is  random,  it 
may mean that the risk assessment is very detailed and deliberate, in order 
to avoid or minimise the risk of serious and irreversible harm to either the 
environment  or  to  human  health.  Where  the  change  is  in  a  position in  the

Directive  2001/18  has  been  amended  several  times  since its  publication  in

In  Opinion  no.  24  on  the  ethics  of  modern  developments  in  agricultural 
technologies,  the  EGE  recognised  that  “[p]ositions  on  GMOs  are  sharply 
divided  across  the  EU.  Industrial  stakeholders  point  to  the  advantages  of 
this technology in terms of ecological sustainability, economic sustainability 
and social sustainability and underline both the increasing public acceptance 
of this technology and its potential to produce enough healthy food for the 
population, while preserving precious resources, such as soil and water, and 
mitigating  climate  change.  Consumers’  organisations,  environmental 
protection  organisations  and  several  NGOs  underline  the  risks  associated 
with  coexistence  of  GM  crops  alongside  natural  species,  the  lack  of  public 
acceptance and the risks stemming from the monopoly which this sector of 
industry could induce.” The group suggested that “[m]any are now arguing 
for mechanisms for performing an environmental impact assessment of new 
technologies, taking into account the risks and benefits of new technologies 
and  the  risks  of  not  implementing  them  –  persisting  with  inefficient, 
unsustainable agriculture, for example.”157 

Chemicals  produced  in  industrial  complexes  (in  containment)  using 
transgenic organisms are not subject to the same strictures as plants grown 
in  the  environment.  They  are  used  as  additives  in  food  (for  example, 
vitamin C) and there has been little or no unfavourable  consumer  reaction

to their use. The use  of such genome  edited micro-organisms is  controlled 
through Directive 2009/41/EC.158  

Contained  use  is  defined  as “any  activity  in  which  micro-organisms  are 
genetically modified or  in which such genetically modified micro-organisms 
(GMMs) are cultured, stored, transported, destroyed, disposed of or used in 
any  other  way,  and  for  which  specific  containment  measures  are  used  to 
limit their contact with, and to provide a high level of safety for, the general 
population and the environment.”159 

Plant products that contain the derivatives of GMOs are remarkably absent 
from  European  supermarkets.  Labelling  requirements  are  strict,  as  are 
traceability  requirements.160  Very  few  GMOs  are  grown  in  Europe,  but  a 
vast amount of plant products containing derivatives of GMOs are imported 
primarily for animal feed. 

It  is  envisaged  that  the  European  Union’s  upcoming  research  funding 
programme Horizon Europe might “allocate €5 million for projects aimed at 
understanding  the  benefits  and  risks  of  genome  editing  technologies  in 
agriculture  over  the  next  two  years.”  The  ‘Farm  to  Fork’  plan  has 
established the aim of reducing the use of fertilisers by 30% and turn 25% 
of  conventionally  farmed  land  into  organic  farming.  In  pursuit  of  these 
aims, the EU  would prepare to “enable major  advances in the life sciences 
and  biotechnology,  in  new  genomic  techniques,  such  as  gene/genome 
editing.”161 

Whilst  most  agricultural  producers  around  the  world  argue  that  there  is  a 
need to use all available technologies to ensure the availability of adequate 
agricultural  products  for  food,  feed,  fibre  and  fuel,  there  are  many  that 
argue  that  a  holistic  approach  to  production  that  respects  traditional 
production  methods  is  a  priority.  There  is  a  view  within  Europe  that  the 
production  of  new  varieties  is  unnecessary.  We  have  more  than  enough 
food  and  feed.  Why  use  techniques  that  may  have  an  impact  on  human 
health and the environment when change is unnecessary?  It is argued that 
alternative  agricultural  solutions  that  do  not  require  the  use  of  plants 
produced using modification of the genome could achieve more stability and

sustainability  of  agricultural  production,  as  well  as  help  to  maintain 
biodiversity  and  environmental  flourishing.  These  arguments  include 
maintaining  a  variety  of  crops,  returning  to  small  fields,  surrounded  by 
hedges  and  non-farmed  land  flanked  by  resource  saving  land  and  water 
management,  avoidance  /minimisation  of  chemical  usage  (herbicides, 
pesticides and fertilisers) by increasing biodiversity and reducing sensitivity 
to monoculture driven pests and weeds.   

Adherence  to  these  and  related  locally  adapted  principles  could  lead  to 
long-term  resource  savings  of  soil  and  water  while  the  increased  need  for 
labour  could  be  set  off  by  increased  automation  and  the  use  of  AI 
technologies for monitoring and intervening on a very fine-grained level. It 
is  argued  that  the  risks  for  the  user  of  the  agricultural  product  are  better 
controlled  by  not  using  GMO  varieties,  and  that  environmental  risks  are 
mitigated using these alternative methods.  

The inverse argument is also made using the same criteria, that the use of 
modified  plants  could improve  our  use  of  land  resulting in  the  (re)creation 
of  more  natural  environments.  Choosing  the  modification  carefully  could 
result in better pest management, less reliance on chemical fertiliser, and a 
better shelf life for plants. Whichever argument is considered, the need for 
a holistic view of the use of land, water and the environment is recognised. 

5.2  Why do we want genome editing in plants? 

New  varieties  of  plants  are  introduced  into  the  market  for  many  reasons, 
including  improvements  in  characteristics  –  yield,  resistance  to  pests, 
adaption  to  particular  or  changing  environments  and  even  catering  to  the 
whims  of  consumers.  Many  changes  can  be  accomplished  by  traditional 
farming  methods  that  require  crossing  with  related  sexually  compatible 
varieties, but this is a slow process, requiring many generations. 

Understanding  the  impact  of  climate  change,  including  desertification, 
drought  or  even  excess  water  in  particular  climatic  areas,  provides  an 
impetus  for  producing  new  varieties  of  plants  that  can  be  adapted  to  the 
changes. 

Changes have been introduced by using chemical or radiation mutagenesis. 
These  techniques  harm  most  of  the  subjected  plants,  but  enough  can  be 
salvaged and selected to allow traditional farming methods to choose those 
plants  which  display  the  wanted  ‘improved’  characteristics.  Genetic

Ethics of Genome Editing 

modification (as used during the last 30 years) took a lot of the guesswork 
out,  but  most  of  the  plants  are  damaged  during  the  modification  process, 
and selection and back crossing are still required to obtain improved useful 
varieties  as  the  position  of  insertion  is  not  defined,  and  disruption  of  the 
genome still has a major impact. Genome editing provides greater precision 
as  to  the  site  of  changes  and  makes  it  possible  to  (largely)  accurately 
identify  the  position  of  modification  in  the  genome,  resulting  in  greater 
precision in  producing new  varieties,  and  hence  more  rapid introduction  of 
new, ‘improved’ varieties to the marketplace. 

Both  genetic  modification  and  genome  editing  make  it  possible  to  insert 
genes  from  other,  non-sexually  compatible  organisms  providing  the 
possibility of using plants for purposes other than that for which they were 
originally  domesticated.  The  techniques  of  genome  editing  also  make 
synthetic  biology  more  likely  –  where  multiple  changes  can  be  made  that 
could fundamentally change the characteristics of the plant. 

There  is  a  need  to  examine  the  agricultural  techniques  currently  used  to 
facilitate  the  growing  and  distribution  of  plant  products.  The  impact  of 
agriculture  on  the  global  environment  is  illustrated  below.  “Agriculture 
contributes nearly one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, uses 37 
percent of landmass (excluding Antarctica), and accounts for 70 percent of 
all  freshwater  withdrawn  from  rivers,  lakes,  and  aquifers.”162  An  impact 
analysis  should  be  holistic,  taking  the impact  of  using  all  technologies  into 
account, including the manner in which choices are made as to which plant, 
on  what  land  and  what  resources  are  needed  to  cultivate  and  bring  the 
products to market.

Agriculture’s share of global environmental impact (2010)163 

New  genetic  technologies  provide  systems  for  identifying  the  targets  for 
disease-causing  pests  in  plants  and  in  many  instances  the  defence 
mechanisms  developed  by  plants  to  attempt  to  mitigate  disease.  Genome 
editing could then be used to make the plants hardier and less susceptible 
to  the  many  challenges  which  nature  provides.  An  example  is  technology 
being  used  to  resist  fungus  infection  on  wheat.  The  most  devastating 
fungus  (UG99)  derives 
through  somatic 
from  rust  strains 
hybridisation.  Scientists  have  been  able  to  stack  five  resistance  genes  into 
one wheat plant to fight this rust.164

5.3  New technologies 

Genome  editing  using  CRISPR/CasX  (Cas9,  Cas12  or  similar)  has 
revolutionised  the  tedious  process  by  allowing  acceleration  of  the  initial 
selection  process  –  already  the  process  used  in  plants  is  a  cheaper  and 
much faster method for achieving the same ends. The system permits gene 
knock-out, deletion, insertions and even gene silencing.

The use of CRISPR with associated enzymes has proved to provide powerful 
tools  to  modify  nucleic  acids.  The  technique  involves  cutting  the  double 
stranded DNA at a specific position and, where appropriate, the insertion of 
new  DNA  using  the  cell’s  own  repair  mechanisms  through  either 
homologous 
“These 
processes  are  inefficient  and  vary  greatly  depending  on  cell  type.  (…) 
However,  base  editing  is  restricted  to  nucleotide  substitutions,  and  thus 
efficient and targeted integration of DNA into the genome remains a major 
challenge.”165 

recombination  or  non-homologous  end-joining. 

New  techniques  of  genome  editing  are  being  developed  all  the  time  to 
increase  both  the  efficiency  and  specificity  of  the  editing  system.  For 
example, the work of Strecker et al. (2019)166 has indicated a new method 
for inserting large stretches of DNA at a precise point in the DNA sequence. 

5.4  Regulation 

“It 

follows 

In  July  2018  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union  (CJEU)  ruled  in 
Case  C-528/16,  Confédération  paysanne  and  Others,  that  organisms 
obtained by methods of mutagenesis are GMOs (“those techniques/methods 
alter  the  genetic  material  of  an  organism  in  a  way  that  does  not  occur 
naturally”, 
that  organisms  obtained  by  means  of 
techniques/methods of mutagenesis must be considered to be GMOs within 
the  meaning  of  Article  2(2)  of  Directive  2001/18”,  paragraphs  29  and 
30).167  The  Court  further  ruled  that  “organisms  obtained  by  mutagenesis 
which have conventionally been used in a number of applications and have 
a  long  safety  record  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  the  directive” 
(paragraph  54),  and  that  “organisms  obtained  by  means  of  new 
techniques/methods  of  mutagenesis  which  have  appeared  or  have  been 
mostly  developed  since  Directive  2001/18  was  adopted”  fall  within  the 
scope (paragraph 51). The Court understood that mutagenesis permits the 
modification  of  the  genome  without  the  insertion  of  foreign  DNA,  unlike 
transgenesis. 

The  Court  considered  amongst  others  that  “the  risks  linked  to  the  use  of 
these new mutagenesis techniques might prove to be  similar to those that

result  from  the  production  and  release  of  a  GMO  through  transgenesis,” 
that “the direct modification of the genetic material of an organism through 
mutagenesis  makes  it  possible  to  obtain  the  same  effects  as  the 
introduction  of  a  foreign  gene  into  that  organism”  and  that  “the 
development  of  those  new  techniques  make  it  possible  to  produce 
genetically  modified  varieties  at  a  rate  and  in quantities  quite  unlike  those 
resulting  from  the  application  of  conventional  methods  of  random 
mutagenesis”  (paragraph  48).  In  view  of  these  potential  risks,  the  Court 
concluded  that  excluding  organisms  obtained  by  mutagenesis  techniques 
from  the  scope  of  the  GMO  Directive  would  compromise  the  objective 
pursued  by  that  Directive,  which  is  to  avoid  adverse  effects  on  human 
health  and  the  environment,  and  would  fail  to  respect  the  precautionary 
principle  which  the  Directive  seeks  to  implement.  It  follows  that  the  GMO 
Directive  is  applicable  to  organisms  obtained  by  mutagenesis 
techniques that have emerged since the adoption of the Directive.168 

The  CJEU judgment implies that a  risk assessment has to be performed in 
accordance  with  the  Directive  on  plants  genetically  modified  using  these 
new techniques. This may prove expensive for those attempting to produce 
new  improved  varieties  and  hence  exclude  small  research  or  commercial 
establishments from the development process, for all sorts of assessment in 
relation  to  these  new  products  are  different  from  the  introduction  of  new 
varieties which have been used for a relatively short time (such as chemical 
or radiation mutagenesis). 

5.5  Are genome edited foods safe?  

All  agricultural  products  contain  mechanisms  developed  by  the  plants  as 
protection  against  predators.  Some  use  spines  or  thorns,  and  many  use 
various  types  of  poison.  Ricin  is  found  in  castor  beans.  A  further  example 
are the cyanogenic glycosides which occur in at least 2000 plant species, of 
which  a  number  of  species  are  used  as  food  in  some  areas  of  the  world. 
Cassava,  sorghum,  stone  fruits,  bamboo  roots  and  almonds  are  especially 
important foods containing cyanogenic glycosides. The potential toxicity of a 
cyanogenic  plant  depends  primarily  on  the  potential  that  its  consumption 
will  produce  a  concentration  of  cyanide  that  is  toxic  to  exposed  humans. 
Many  types  of  beans  contain  lectins,  and  kidney  beans  have  the  highest 
concentrations  –  especially  red  kidney  beans.  As  few  as  4  or  5  raw  beans

Ethics of Genome Editing 

can  cause  severe  stomach  ache,  vomiting  and  diarrhoea.  Lectins  are 
destroyed when the dried beans are soaked for at least 12 hours and then 
boiled  vigorously  for  at  least  10  minutes  in  water.169  Solanine is  an 
extremely  poisonous  glycoalkaloid  found  in  the  genus  Solanum  (for 
example,  potato (Solanum  tuberosum),  tomato  (Solanum  lycopersicum), 
eggplant 
(Atropa 
(Solanum  melongena)  and  deadly  nightshade 
belladonna)).  It  can  occur  naturally  in  any  part  of  the  plant,  including  the 
leaves, fruit, and tubers. No maximum levels for glycoalkaloids in potatoes 
have  been  established  at  EU  level.  Some  Member  States  have  a  national 
maximum  level  of  200  μg/kg.170  Plant  breeding  could  increase  the 
concentration  of  such  toxins  or  allergens  in  plants,  yet  there  have  been  a 
negligible  number  of  food  poisoning  issues  due  to  the  introduction  of  new 
varieties into the food chain.171 

Solanine 

It  is  unlikely  that  a  modification  will  have  deliberately  or  incidentally 
introduced  new  toxins  into  a  plant,  but  the  introduction  of  new  genetic 
material  will  almost  certainly  result  in  a  change  in  the  production  of  some 
chemicals by a plant – hence some form of risk assessment would normally 
be expected. Tests to ensure that toxicity remains within safe bounds would 
always be necessary for any new variety, regardless of the technology used 
in its production. 

The  impact  on  the  environment  of  new  varieties  may  also  impact  on  the 
perception that their use may be unsafe.

What therefore constitutes safe? Is a new variety to be tested on the basis 
of ‘as safe as that currently on the market’?  Does the new variety have to 
be  safer  than  that  currently  used?  Should  the  whole  system,  including 
chemicals used, land used and protection (or otherwise) of the agricultural 
diversity  be  taken  into  account  in  deciding  on  safety?  Should  the 
requirement “based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of 
action  or  lack  of  action  (including,  where  appropriate  and  feasible,  an 
economic cost/benefit analysis)” be part of this analysis? 

5.6  Identification 

Genetically  modified  plants  could  be  identified  (in  all  instances  so  far)  as 
introduced  genes  included  DNA  like  the  cauliflower  mosaic  virus  promoter 
for  which  probes  existed.  This  has  enabled  relatively  simple  traceability, 
testing and labelling. 

Genetically  modified  feed  products  are  more  readily  imported  and  used 
within the EU. Their traceability is assured, but there is no requirement for 
labelling of animals that have been fed on genetically modified feed. 

Genome  edited  products  may  not  include  easily  identifiable  elements  that 
could  be  used  to  mark  products  as  having  been  made  using  genome 
editing.  There  would  be  a  possibility  of  requiring  the  introduction  of  some 
form  of  marker  through  genome  editing  when  producing  the  plant  within 
the EU. Genome editing might involve the insertion of new genes from both 
related  and  unrelated  species,  deletion  of  large  or  small  sections  of  the 
DNA,  and  even  the  insertion  of  single  bases  to  change  a  particular  protein 
to  that  found  in  other  organisms.  Where  major  changes  have  been 
introduced  the  requirement  to  ‘mark’  the  product  may  be  imposed,  but  if 
there is a small change to make the plant produce gene-products which are 
found  in  related  plants  the  impact  of  requiring  such  a  marker  may  be 
deleterious  to  the  plant.  In  some  instances  a  change  might  be  introduced 
using genome editing where the modified gene is the same as that found in 
sexually  compatible  species  where  genome  editing  is  simply  quicker.  It  is 
argued  that  off-target  (unintended)  modifications,  where  they  occur,  may 
help in identifying the plant as having been modified. Introduced changes of

flanking  coding  bases,  which  do  not  lead  to  amino  acid  changes,  are 
possible and could be used to distinguish edited from non-edited plants.172  

However,  much  food  and  feed  and  seed  used  in  the  EU  is  imported  from 
countries  which  have  no  such  requirement  –  such  as  most  of  South  and 
North America and China.  It may be difficult if not impossible to distinguish 
between  imported  genome  edited  plants  and  other  new  varieties,  or  any 
derived  products,  when  imported.  There  would  have  to  be  significant 
scientifically  justifiable  grounds  for  excluding  such  products  from  the 
market due to WTO rules. 

Traceability requirements apply in the EU, where the producers of the plant 
or  seed  have  to  provide  documentary  evidence  to  show  that  a  product 
contains,  consists  or  is  produced  from  a  GMO.173  The  cost  could  be 
considerable  and  non-European  producers  have  to,  but  may  not  be  willing 
to  comply.  As  the  new  varieties  are  then  used  as  the  starting  point  for 
further  varieties  using  traditional  methods  the  complexity  of  the  system 
would mitigate against any such approach.  

It  is  likely  that  modifications  introduced  through  conventional  breeding 
techniques  (even  those  preceding  2001),  occurring  naturally  or  through 
genome editing may not be able to be distinguished from one another.  

It may be possible to use patent or plant variety rights registers as a means 
to  identify  plants  which  have  been  modified  using  the  new  techniques. 
However,  if  controls  on  cross-breeding  are  not  instituted  uniformly  across 
the  world  and  if  licences  for  using  patents  are  not  generally  maintained, 
even this would not provide a robust traceability technology.  The Enlarged 
Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office174 ruled on the 14 May 2020 
that plant or animal products that are exclusively obtained by means of an 
essentially biological process are not eligible for patent protection and may 
be  protected  through  plant  variety  registration.  Genetically  modified  or 
edited plants remain patentable. The use of a genetically modified plant as 
the starting material for new varieties may be costly for breeders in Europe.  

172  See  also  the  European  Network  of  GMO  Laboratories’  (ENGL)  report  on  the  “Detection  of 

food and feed plant products obtained by new mutagenesis techniques” (2019). 

173 The existing GMO legislation already requires the operators to hold and transmit information 
to  the  next operator  regarding  the  presence of  a  GMO  in  a  product  (Article  4  of Regulation 
1830/2003).

5.7  Biodiversity 

The loss of a vast range of plants due to urbanisation and climate change is 
unavoidable  even  if  action  is  taken.  However,  the  production  of  new 
varieties  of  edible  plants  that  have  desired  characteristics  using  the  whole 
gamut  of  scientific  tools  may  cause  a  decrease  in  agricultural  biodiversity. 
Differences  in  climate  and  soil  characteristics  mean  that  different  varieties 
are grown in different habitats – farmers choosing the best variety for their 
purposes. The CGIAR institutes176 collect and maintain genetic resources for 
particular  plants  to  ensure  their  survival.  “The  purpose  of  the  CGIAR 
System  is  to  advance  agri-food  science  and  innovation  to  enable  poor 
people,  especially  women,  to  better  nourish  their  families,  and  improve

manage  natural  resources  in  the  face  of  climate  change  and  other 
challenges.”177 

Many  argue  that  the  rapid  pace  of  development  of  new  varieties  given 
modern tools will have a deleterious effect on plant genetic resources. Older 
methods  of  enhancement  took  time,  and  their  impact  was  thus  probably 
lower on the agricultural environment. 

New  varieties  with  traits  attractive  to  farmers,  whether  due  (for  example) 
to an increase in yield, resistance to depredation by insects or resistance to 
abiotic stress – drought, excess water – could ‘crowd out’ current varieties, 
leading  to  a  loss  of  a  whole  range  of  current  varieties  and  if  care  is  not 
taken,  to  the  development  of  the  equivalent  of  monocultures  where  too 
much  of  the  particular  variety  is  chosen.  This  would  clearly  pose  serious 
challenges  if  it  later  became  obvious  that  the  new  variety  was  more 
susceptible to disease or other stress related issues. 

The  impact  of  genome  edited  plants  on  the  natural  environment  could  be 
both positive and negative. If a gene inserted into a plant is transferred to 
natural  relatives  the  result  could  be  the  creation  of  weeds  and  the  loss  of 
control  (e.g.  herbicide  tolerance).  The  opposite  may  be  true  if  the  new 
genetic  element  has  food  or  feed  advantages  or  is  toxic  to  some  insects  – 
allowing  the  plants  within  the  environment  to  better  adapt  to  their 
environment. The effects may seriously impact the ecosystem – resulting in 
a  deleterious  change  in  the  whole  environment.  Increase  in  yield  per 
hectare,  on  the  other  hand,  may  allow  the  retention  of  uncultivated  land 
which  could  impact  the  natural  environment  in  a  positive  manner  –  this  is 
discussed  in  detail  in  EGE  Opinion  n°24.178  An  example  is  deforestation  in 
order  to  grow  crops  which  is  a  major  issue  in  tropical  regions  where  the 
needs of the European consumer may impact on the lives and environment 
in unexpected ways.  

Should  companies  introducing  new  varieties,  regardless  of  method  of  the 
provenance,  be  required  to  identify  the  impact  of  their  use  on  biodiversity 
and the environment?

5.8  Industrialisation of agriculture 

The impact of the industrialisation of agriculture should not be taken lightly. 
New varieties have often resulted in greater industrialisation as the selected 
traits impact on the way the crops are grown. This could be exacerbated by 
the  ready  availability  of  new  traits  specifically  chosen  to  (apparently) 
benefit the farmer. 

  Larger  farms  have  an  impact  on  the  general  biodiversity  (rather  than 
agricultural  biodiversity)  through  the  disappearance  of  hedges  and  non-
farmed  areas  of  a  field.    (“When  you  reap  the  harvest  of  your  land,  do 
not  reap  to  the  very edges of  your field or  gather  the  gleanings  of  your 
harvest.” – Leviticus 19:9). 

  Smallholders  struggle  to  compete  with  larger  farms,  even  where  the 
quality of their produce may be higher, or more desirable to consumers. 
The  terroir  argument  remains  an  important  facet  of  agriculture,  where 
the  nature  of  the  plant-soil  interaction  is  important.  The  importance  of 
terroir  impacts  on  the  price  of  both  the  product  and  items  made  from 
that product, and there the Slow Food movement appreciated the history 
of the plant (or animal) variety, the story of the farmer and the quality of 
the product.179 

  The  number  of 

individuals  employed 

falls  as 
industrialisation  occurs.    Agriculture  is  a  large  employer  in  the  EU,  with 
about  9.7  million  people,  about  4.2%  of  the  employed.  The  less 
industrialised  the  country,  the  greater  the  proportion  of  individuals 
employed  in  the  agriculture  sector.180  As  the  proportion  employed  in 
agriculture  increases,  urbanisation  and  problems  relating  to  distribution 
of food are exacerbated.

5.9  Biosecurity 

Biosecurity  has  been  defines  as  “a  strategic  and  integrated  approach  that 
encompasses  the  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks  (including  instruments 
and activities) that analyse and manage risks in the sectors of food safety, 
animal  life  and  health,  and  plant  life  and  health,  including  associated 
environmental  risk.  Biosecurity  covers  the  introduction  of  plant  pests, 
animal  pests  and  diseases,  and  zoonoses,  the  introduction  and  release  of 
genetically  modified  organisms  (GMOs)  and  their  products,  and  the 
introduction  and  management  of  invasive  alien  species  and  genotypes. 
Biosecurity  is  a  holistic  concept  of  direct  relevance  to  the  sustainability  of 
agriculture,  food  safety,  and  the  protection  of  the  environment,  including 
biodiversity.”181 

There  is  a  concern  that  modern  techniques  of  genome  editing  may  impact 
adversely  on  biosecurity  when  defined  in  this  manner.  In  particular,  the 
security  of  supply  of  particular  major  crop  species  could  be  impacted, 
especially where possible monocultures are used.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Food  security  has  become  an  important  issue,  particularly  with  a  growing 
urban  population,  the  impact  of  climate  change,  limited  land  available  for 
agricultural expansion and the need to have an efficient distribution system 
where losses during transportation are minimised. The new techniques may 
have a role to play.182  

What  incentives  could  be  introduced  to  ensure  that  new  varieties  address 
biosecurity and security of supply for food, feed, fibre and fuel? 

5.10  Justice 

The  issue  of  justice  is  addressed  in  EGE  Opinion  n°24Error!  Bookmark  not 
defined..183  Commercial  agriculture  competes  with  small  farms,  which  again 
may  well  compete  with  subsistence  agriculture.  The  expansion  of 
commercial agriculture will often be at the expense of smaller farmers who 
do not have the resources to compete. New varieties better able to compete 
within the agricultural sphere may exacerbate the conflict. The technologies 
could,  however,  be  used  to  improve  the  lives  of  subsistence  farmers 
through developing plants providing quality products both in terms of yield 
per hectare and nutritional quality. 

Modern  techniques  for  the  production  of  new  varieties,  whether  or  not  by 
genome editing, have been the prerogative of large seed companies, due to 
the  cost  of  producing  them.  This  has  led  to  the  monopolisation  of  the 
production  of  seed  within  a  small  group  of  companies,  and  considerable 
public  reaction  to  some  of  these  companies.  Very  considerable  testing  of 
new  varieties  produced  using  genetic  modification  ensuring  their  safety 
resulted in high costs, which made the production of such varieties by small 
companies  or  research  organisations  prohibitive.  This  in  turn  led  to  the 
monopolisation about which there are many concerns. The techniques could 
have an impact on distribution systems, resulting in quality food becoming 
available where it is needed, in the urban environment. 

Should the requirements linked to the introduction of plants developed with 
the  techniques  of  mutagenesis  involving  genome  editing  be  the  same  as 
that  for  other  GMOs  (as  essentially  required  by  the  CJEU  judgment),  the 
ability of small companies, research organisations or universities to produce

new  varieties  (initially  for  local  use)  would  be  seriously  curtailed,  and  this 
could result in monopolisation due to the costs entailed in assuring safety. 

Any additional risk assessment requirements could prove costly and impose 
a  high  regulatory  burden,  further  preventing  smaller  companies  and 
research centres from commercialising products. Should consideration be 
given  to  structures  that  support  smaller  actors  to  undertake  risk 
assessments and enter the market? 

5.11  Societal considerations 

Food  quality  is  an  extremely  important  issue  within  the  EU.  It  is  often 
regional and of cultural importance. Many reject the importation of cheaper 
foods and choose to buy regional varieties. There are many who argue that 
there  is  no  need  for  new  varieties  or  products  within  the  food  sector.  The 
debate  about  scientific  risk  could  once  again  become  an  overtly  political 
debate  about  food  quality,  paysan  survival,  and  trade  policy.  Culture  and 
history are important.184 

A  mistake  made  during  the  introduction  of  genetically  modified  products 
was  to  not  involve  the  public  in  choosing  that  which  was  introduced  onto 
the  market.  There  is  a  clear  need  for  honest  dialogue  and  the  inclusion  of 
all  the  public  in  framing  the  decision-making  process  for  introducing  new 
products  to  the  market.  There  is  much  false  information  or  hype  provided 
by  all  sides  in  the  debate  about  new  technologies  that  produce  this  most 
basic  commodity.  Mechanisms  for  ensuring  the  veracity  of  the  information 
provided to the public should be carefully considered. 

The  effects  of  increased  prices  and  availability  where  strong  regulation  is 
required  should  also  be  considered.  This  would  impact  on  the  poorest 
segment of society. 

The  use  of  patents  in  the  introduction  of  new  traits  regardless  of  whether 
genome  editing  technologies  are  used  creates  problems  which  must  be 
addressed.185  The  costs  of  developing  new  traits  are  significant,  as  in 
general, the identification of the trait and its insertion into a variety is costly 
and  the  new  varieties  have  normally  to  undergo  extensive  field  trials.

Patents are a mechanism for cost recovery. Patents also increase the costs 
of  those  using  the  patented  varieties  and  may  inhibit  the  use  of  new 
varieties by the farmer.  

The  patent  system  makes  it  difficult  for  stacked  traits  to  exist  in  varieties 
where  the  patents  are  held  by  different  patentees,  especially  where  strict 
protocols are imposed on farmers using the varieties in which the patented 
trait is expressed.186  Plant variety rights, however, provide plant breeders 
with  rights  to  use  existing  varieties  as  a  starting  point  for  creating  a  new 
variety which is distinct, uniform and stable.  

It  is  likely  that  the  use  of  patents  in  plants  impacts  on  the  ability  of  small 
and medium sized plant-breeders to introduce new varieties to the market 
especially where it is desirable to introduce multiple traits.   

There  is  a  need  to  ensure  food  security,  provide  renewable  resources  for 
fuel, feed and fibre, safeguard the retention of biodiversity and protect our 
environment.  Genome  editing  technologies  could,  with  appropriate  and 
proportionate control, enhance our ability to achieve these goals.

6  GENE DRIVES 

Gene drives are a specific use of genome editing that has drawn particular 
attention  as  it  offers  the  promise  of  the  possibility  to  guide  a  ‘biased’ 
inheritance of  certain genes in entire animal or insect populations to make 
them  harmless  or  more  vulnerable.  Gene  drives  would  thus  offer  a  broad 
scope  of  application,  including  to  eliminate  insect-borne  human  diseases, 
support  more  sustainable  agricultural  models  and  control  environmentally 
damaging  invasive  species.187  Studies  have,  for  example,  assessed  the 
possibility  of  releasing  transgenic  mosquitoes  to  combat  the  spread  of 
malaria  and  other  mosquito-borne  diseases.188  Yet,  gene  drives  also  pose 
serious risks and a range of ethical considerations are imperative. 

6.1  What characterises gene drives?  

Gene drives change the way in which certain genes (and therefore the traits 
that they encode) are inherited: they ‘drive’ a trait into a population. They 
comprise  different  molecular  and  non-molecular  mechanisms  and  can  only 
occur  in  species  that  reproduce  sexually.  For  example,  a  trait  that  would 
‘normally’  be  passed  on  from  parent  to  offspring  with  a  50%  chance  of 
being  inherited  (depending  on  whether  the  offspring  inherits  the  maternal 
or  paternal  variant)  would,  with  a  gene  drive,  be  inherited  by  virtually  all 
offspring. This is meant by ‘biased’ inheritance.  

Such ‘bias’ – that is, such increased likelihood for a trait to be passed on – 
could  stem  from  human  intervention,  or  it  could  result  from  the  chance  of 
external framework conditions (such as radiation), or the change of factors 
within  the  genome  that  increase  the  likelihood  of  some  traits  being 
inherited. Genome editing by human intervention is only one among several 
possible ways through which biased inheritance could occur.  

Gene drives are not a new phenomenon, and certainly not one that has only 
been  made  possible  through  genome  editing:  naturally  occurring  gene 
drives do exist. For the purpose of this Opinion, however, we consider only 
those gene drives that came into existence through direct, targeted human

intervention via the editing of genomes.189 Table 1 contains an overview of 
two types of gene drives, according to the different kind and level of human 
intervention. The grey row signifies the gene drives that we consider in this 
Opinion.  

Compared to genome editing approaches described in other sub-sections of 
this  Opinion,  gene  drives  represent  a  unique  ethical  challenge  not  only 
because  of  the  rapid  pace  by  which  they  can  change  large  populations  of 
species,  but  also  because  in  the  context  of  gene  drives,  the  very  tool  that 
modifies  the  genome  is  being  released.  In  other  forms  of  genome  editing, 
the finished ‘product’, namely the genome-edited organism, is released. In 
addition, the effects of gene drives may be difficult or impossible to detect 
and undo. 

This  means  that  in  the  context  of  gene  drives  uncertainty  is  particularly 
high. It also extends to the capacity of the technology to deliver on certain 
scientific promises,  for  example, that the  effects of  knocking out a  specific 
gene/trait on mosquitos would persist over generations and that the ability 
to carry viruses would not return; uncertainty also over the technical ability 
(claimed  by  some  gene  drive  scientists)  to  reverse  the  process,  and 
uncertainty about the  factors that  can have bearing on the effects of gene 
drives.

6.2  Concerns 

These  unique  features  of  gene  drives  have  raised  a  number  of  ethical 
concerns that have been discussed in various fora.191 Dimensions that have, 
in our view, not  yet received sufficient systematic attention are global and 
epistemic justice, as well as anthropocentrism: 

6.2.1  Social justice considerations 

If  specific  gene  drives  will  ever  be  found  to  be  a  safe  and  effective  tool  in 
limiting  human  diseases,  how  can  we  ensure  that  those  populations  that 
need  it  the  most  have  access  to  gene  drives?  How  can  we  ensure  that 
people in low resource contexts can participate in decisions on research and 
development  in  this  context,  including  the  setting  of  research  priorities? 
How  can  we  ensure  adequate  funding  for  projects  that  will  benefit  those 
who  need  it  most?  How  can  we  ensure  that  we  try  not  only  to  solve  the 
questions that are scientifically most interesting, but also those that seek to 
alleviate the greatest suffering?  

6.2.2  Epistemic justice 

Epistemic  justice  means  an  honest  attempt  at  describing  problems,  and 
formulating  solutions,  in  such  a  way  that  they  reflect  the  views  and  needs 
of  different  groups  of  people  within  and  across  societies.  What  elites  in 
some  parts  of  the  world  consider  the  most  pressing  issues,  and  what 
solutions  they  may  consider  just,  does  not  necessarily  reflect  the 
preferences  and  needs  of  all  people  in  the  world.  We  need  democratically 
legitimate and epistemically just ways to decide what gene drives should be 
used  for,  on  what  species  and  for  what  purposes,  seeking  to  ensure  that 
those who need it most benefit from gene drives.  

6.2.3  Overcoming anthropocentrism 

Besides  the  rights  and  interests  of  humans,  we  also  need  to  consider  the 
wellbeing  of  non-human  entities.  There  is  an  increasing  recognition  that 
animals  and  plants,  and  our  ecosystem  as  a  whole,  should  not  only  be

protected for the sake of human health and wellbeing, but also in their own 
right.  What  this  means  in  practice,  and  how  it  is,  and  can  be  enshrined  in 
the law, is not always clear. While there is large body of work on the rights 
of primates and other mammals,192 the status of insects, fish and plants, is 
less clear. Does an individual mosquito have rights? What about Anopheles 
gambiae?  Does  nature  have  rights?  Some  countries  have  started  to  give 
personhood  status  to  rivers;  are  there  other  parts  of  nature  that  should 
have  rights  in  ways  analogous  to  humans?  How  would  these  rights  be 
enforced?  How  can  we  ensure  that  the  interests  of  all  species  are 
considered in regulation and governance decisions? 

There is a clear need for collective, democratically legitimate ways to decide 
what  gene  drives  should  be  used  for,  on  what  species  and  for  what 
purposes. At the same time, the fact that gene drives are relatively easy to 
make  also  presents  a  dilemma  in  the  context  of  democratising  science:  If 
people  decide  to  make  use  of  gene  drives  for  purposes  they  deem 
important,  should  (scientific  or  political)  elites  tell  them  not  to  do  this? 
According  to  what  criteria?  Should  we  treat  gene  drives  in  analogy  to 
weapons  and  limit  access?  How  can  such  access  be  policed?  Should 
mandatory approval or certification processes for newly created gene drives 
be  in  place,  and  should  these  be  located  at  institutional,  national, 
supranational, or international levels?

In  its  2016  statement193  the  EGE  called  for  an  inclusive  societal  debate  on 
new  genome  editing  technologies  which  it  deems  a  pre-condition  to 
permitting  the  use  of  these  technologies.  It  recommends  that  genome 
editing  should  not  be  applied  without  a  general  agreement  resulting  from 
informed  global  dialogue,  constantly  striving  for  global  consensus.  Public 
debate  should  address  how  genome  editing  is  perceived  and  assessed  by 
citizens,  which  opinions,  hopes  and  fears  they  hold,  across  fields  of 
application,  and  whether  germline  genome  editing  is  seen  as  necessary 
and/or  acceptable,  or  would  be  so  under  what  conditions.  Fora  for  debate 
should  be  organised  on  local  and  European  levels  that  are  integrated  in 
international dialogue, acquiring global scope. 

In this context, the  EGE proposes an increase of  resources to develop and 
employ innovative formats for public engagement (including, but not limited 
to,  education)  and  deliberation  (e.g.  citizens’  assemblies)  on  ethical 
questions related to genome editing. Such deliberation should be based on 
democratic  principles,  be  open  to  everyone,  involve  a  wide  variety  of 
stakeholders  and  forms  of  expertise  and  be  inclusive,  interdisciplinary  and 
pluralistic.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Avoid  narrow  conceptualisations  to  frame  debates  about  the  ethics 
and governance of genome editing 

Whereas debates about genome editing often focus on the question of ‘how 
safe  is  safe  enough’,  the  EGE  draws  attention  to  the  importance  of 
providing  nuance  to  this  framing.  Resisting  this  narrow  framing,  it  is 
necessary  to  extend  the  scope  of  analysis  and  debate  to  underlying 
concepts  and  approaches,  with  regard  to,  notably,  humanness,  human 
diversity and biodiversity, naturalness and the value of living beings.  

The  ‘safe  enough’  narrative  limits  reflections  on  ethics  and  governance  to 
considerations about safety; it purports that it is sufficient for a given level 
of  safety  to  be  reached  in  order  for  a  technology  to  be  rolled  out 
unhindered,  thereby  eschewing  ethically  important  questions  such  as 
whether  genome  editing  is  in  fact  necessary,  acceptable,  and  under  what 
conditions.  Notably,  those  who  are  using  the  technology  must  ensure  that 
they  are  monitoring  for  unpredicted  and  unintended  events,  and  act  upon 
them  accordingly  and  without  delay.  This  also  extends  to  questions  of 
coordination, 
‘safety’  or 
‘trustworthiness’  do  not  pertain  solely  to  technologies  but  also  to 
institutions  and  forms  of  governance  in  societies  –  including  matters  of 
oversight as well as of democracy and rule of law.  

inequalities  and  power  relations.  In 

fact, 

The  EGE  points  to  the  need  to  use  common  conceptual  categories  with 
caution and regularly analyse them with regard to their aptness. Traditional 
dichotomies  and  divisions,  such  as  those  between  somatic  and  germline 
genome  editing,  between  therapy,  prevention  and  enhancement,  or 
between  basic,  translational  and  clinical  research,  can  offer  useful 
operational  distinctions  in  certain  cases,  but  caution  is  needed  where  they 
constitute  artificial,  meaningless  or  misleading  boundaries  and  especially 
where such categories are imbued with ethical or legal value. 

Develop  international  guidelines  and  strengthen  national,  regional 
and global governance tools 

The  EGE  recommends  that  the  European  Commission,  together  with 
appropriate  international  bodies  who  are  also  already  working  in  this  area 
(notably WHO, FAO, ISO), develop standards and guidelines for the ethical 
and safe use of genome editing across all areas of application. 

The  EGE  also  recommends  to  establish  regulatory  oversight  for  ‘do-it-
yourself’  (DIY)  genome  editing  tools.  The  relative  ease  and  simplicity  of 
applying  new  genome  editing  tools  in  humans,  animals  and  plants 

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 

85 

Ethics of Genome Editing 

prompted  the  development  and  commercial  distribution  of  DIY  genome 
editing  kits,  accessible  for  purchase  to  anyone.  The  EGE  is  of  the  opinion 
that  their  application  requires  regulatory  oversight,  which  in  case  of 
humans may be based  on the gene therapy regulatory framework. For the 
application of genome editing tools in other organisms, the EGE proposes to 
establish  regulatory  structures  that  assesses  risk  of  application  for  the 
organism  and  the  environment  and  certifies  their  safety.  The  European 
Commission  is  advised  to  develop  mechanisms  to  avoid  or  mitigate  harm 
through unregulated availability of DIY kits on the internet, for example, by 
implementing strong liability rules. 

Further  recommendations  on  governance  follow  in  the  sections  below, 
applying  to  genome  editing  in  humans,  animals  and  plants  and  to  gene 
drives respectively. 

7.2  On genome editing in humans  

Engage  in  global  governance  initiatives  and  create  a  platform  for 
information  sharing  and  inclusive  debate  on  germline  genome 
editing 

The  EGE  asks  the  European  Commission  to  engage  in  a  global  mechanism 
to  guarantee  that  heritable  human  genome  editing  is  not  prematurely 
clinically applied and is not applied for purposes other than against serious 
diseases that cannot be prevented or treated otherwise.  On this basis, the 
EGE  calls  for  the  creation  of  a  European  Platform  to  facilitate  exchange  of 
information  and  a  broad  and  open  public  debate  on  the  ethical  and  social 
implications  of  germline  genome  editing  in  human  beings  on  the  basis  of 
sound  and  evidence-based  information.  The  functioning  of  the  platform 
should,  importantly,  also  integrate  international  dialogue  and  cooperation 
beyond  Europe,  for  example,  with  the  Global  Observatory  for  Genome 
Editing,  in  order  to  acquire  global  scope  and  contribute  to  processes 
towards global consensus.  

In this debate, awareness should be raised about the implications of widely 
used  terminologies  and  distinctions,  such  as  those  between  somatic  and 
germline  editing  or  between  prevention,  therapy  and  enhancement,  about 
the  need  to  examine  them  and  to  use  them  with  caution  regarding  their 
ethical and legal normativity. This responds to the need for values to shape 
technology  and  helps  to  ensure  that,  in  case  heritable  genome  editing  will 
be  advanced  and  applied  in  countries  under  certain  circumstances,  this  is 

86  

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 

 
Ethics of Genome Editing 

preceded by careful consideration of the conceptualisation, acceptability and 
desirability of the technology. 

The  proposed  platform  can  also  aim  at  the  participatory  development  of  a 
governance  framework  that  determines,  for  example,  who  decides  on 
cases, on what premises decisions are based, and what oversight structures 
are adequate. Its efforts and actions should be aligned with the work of the 
WHO  Expert  Advisory  Committee  on  Developing  Global  Standards  for 
Governance  and  Oversight  of  Human  Genome  Editing.  The  EGE 
recommends  that  the  European  Commission  collaborates  with  the  WHO 
and, where appropriate, with the WMA to facilitate the universal adoption of 
standards on the ethical use of genome editing in human beings. 

Establish a public registry for research on germline genome editing  

Transparency  and  evidence-based  information  is  of  utmost  importance  to 
foster an inclusive societal debate. To support an informed debate, the EGE 
recommends  to  establish  a  European  and/or  global  registry  for  germline 
genome  editing  (that  could  also  be  part  of  the  proposed  European 
Platform).  It  should  cooperate  with  the  global  registry  for  human  genome 
editing  established  by  the  WHO.  The  registry  should  be  publicly  accessible 
to  ensure  transparency  for  monitoring  scientific  progress  and  ethical 
soundness.  Ethical  approval  and  legal  compliance  must  be  a  precondition 
for any registry entry. 

Project  registration  is  already  compulsory  for  all  research  on  germline 
genome  editing  funded  by  the  EU  and  should  become  mandatory  for  all 
research.  

Protect social justice, diversity and equality 

Given  the  potential  of  genome  editing  techniques  to  be  used  for 
interventions  that  are  not  related  to  preventing  or  treating  diseases  but 
primarily  serve  enhancement  purposes,  their  potential  for  fostering  social 
inequality  and  undermining  diversity  should  be  considered.  The  EGE 
recommends  to  proactively  safeguard  against  enhancement  or  de-
enhancement  of  traits  and  to  ensure  that  investments  in  research  on 
germline  genome  editing  have  the  purpose  of  protecting  health.  This  also 
serves  protecting  human  dignity,  identity,  diversity,  equality,  social  justice 
and  solidarity.  In  this  context,  guidelines  should  be  developed  that  allow 
research  ethics  committees  to  distinguish  between  technologies  and 
applications  of  genome  editing  that  are  to  be  considered  as  preventive, 

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 

87 

Ethics of Genome Editing 

diagnostic  or  therapeutic,  and  those  that  are  to  be  considered  as  ‘human 
enhancement’, if such distinctions are to be used. 

Furthermore, somatic genome editing has the potential to alleviate suffering 
from  diseases  that  could  not  be  treated  effectively  before.  The  EGE 
recommends  that  access  to  clinical  studies  and,  once  approved,  to  clinical 
application  in  healthcare  is  granted  according  to  the  principle  of  social 
justice and without discrimination. 

Ensure adequate competencies in expert bodies 

Genome  editing  technologies  are  evolving  quickly  and  expertise  to  assess 
research  and  application  has  to  keep  pace  with  new  developments.  It  is 
important  to  widen  the  basis  of  expertise  and  broaden  what  counts  as 
relevant knowledge at the level of expert committees, fora and other bodies 
established  to  examine  and  set  guidelines  and  standards  for  research  and 
application of genome editing technologies. In light of the global variety of 
views  on  the  essence  of  human  nature,  it  is  important  to  organise  ethics 
oversight  of  international  research  collaboration  and  prevent  ethics 
dumping. 

Such  adequacy  of  expertise  is  crucial  also  for  ethics  committees  charged 
with approving and supervising clinical trials involving genome editing. The 
EGE  suggests  that  guidelines  for  safety  assessments  and  risk/benefit 
determinations  of  clinical  trials  are  developed  and  training  modules  are 
provided  for  research  ethics  committees  and  other  involved  bodies  to 
ensure high-standing and consistent application of ethical standards. 

If  national  legislation  of  Member  States  allows  research  involving  human 
embryos  this  suggestion  also  applies  to  this  kind  of  research.  Different 
Member  States  have  different  laws  on  embryo  research.  The  principle  of 
subsidiarity should continue to be respected.  

7.3  On genome editing in animals 

Strengthen  oversight  of  genome  editing  in  animals  for  scientific 
experiments according to, and beyond, the 3Rs 

The  EGE  calls  for  a  careful  monitoring  of  the  impact  of  genome  editing 
techniques  on  the  implementation  of  the  3Rs,  including  the  balance 
between Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. To this end, (1) the EGE 
recommends  reinforcing  reporting  requirements  with  respect  to  scientific 

88  

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 

 
Ethics of Genome Editing 

experiments  using  genome  edited  animals,  including  documenting  their 
purposes;  (2)  the  EGE  urges  research  ethics  committees  and  bodies  in 
charge  of  project  evaluation  to  carefully  evaluate  the  costs/benefits  of 
genome  editing  experimentation  taking  the  3Rs  framework  into  account; 
(3)  the  EGE  recommends  that  researchers  be  required  to  ensure 
transparency,  sharing  of  data  and  tissues,  and  the  publication  of  negative 
results in order to minimise uncoordinated duplication of experiments. 

The  EGE  also  suggests  to  consider  a  further  R  in  relation  with  research 
funding,  Recourse  to  alternative  strategies,  as  indicated  below  for  non-
human primates. 

Apply strict standards to experimentation with non-human primates 
and invest in the development of alternatives 

Where  the  advances  of  genetic  engineering  techniques  provide  new 
opportunities  for  the  development  of  primate  genetic  models,  the  EGE 
recalls  the  specific  status  accorded  to  non-human  primates  (NHPs)  in  the 
EU legal framework on  animal experimentation and supports the  view that 
humans bear strong moral obligations towards NHPs that move beyond the 
standard 3Rs framework and standard ethics of animal experimentation. It 
considers that experimentation involving NHPs is morally acceptable only if 
(1)  serious  human  suffering  can  be  prevented  by  carrying  out  scientific 
research  on  primates,  that  can  in  no  other  way  be  alleviated,  and  (2)  the 
way  of  dealing  with  NHPs  in  these  processes  accommodates  the  wealth  of 
scientific  findings  on  their  physical,  mental  and  emotional  lives  and  the 
modalities of their wellbeing and suffering. 

In  the  context  of  genome  editing  experiments  on  NHPs,  the  EGE 
recommends the introduction of an additional ‘R’ to the 3Rs framework for 
Recourse  to  alternative  strategies.  This  principle  would  go  beyond 
refinement  and  would  require  a  channelling  of  research  resources  into  the 
search for alternatives to experiments and genetic engineering with harmful 
phenotype  expressions.  This  could  for  instance  take  the  form  of  funding 
bodies  requiring  researchers  conducting  experiments  on  NHPs  to  allocate 
part  of  the  research  budget  to  finding  alternative  methods,  for  example, 
through a requirement in EU-funded projects of an integrated work package 
or clearly defined activities to develop alternative methods. 

Because  of  the  evolutionary  closeness  to  humans,  intentions  to  study 
humanisation  in  NHPs  by  genome  editing  are  likely.  The  EGE  proposes  a 
humanisation assessment when genome editing is used to modify genes to 
model  human  phenotypes  in  order  to  anticipate  possible  outcomes  and

Ethics of Genome Editing 

refinement needs. Such projects ought to be registered in a public database 
under  the  responsibility  of  a  public  authority.  In  addition,  criteria  for 
constraints ought to be developed (see next recommendation). 

Broadly  discuss  the  humanisation  of  animals  and  implement 
appropriate limitations 

in  humanisation,  whereby  animals  may  gain 

The  EGE  calls  for  further  reflection  on  the  implications  of,  and  moral 
obligations with regard to, genome editing experimentation on animals that 
results 
functions  or 
characteristics  usually  attributed  only  to  humans.  Given  the  potential 
advances  brought  by  genome  editing  technologies  to  this  domain,  in 
particular  in  the  area  of  cognition  and  neuro-functioning,  consideration 
should be given to constraints that should be imposed on such procedures. 
A  scientific  and  public  debate  on  such  constraints  and  respective  criteria 
would be desirable. 

Regulate  the  banking  and  farming  on  animals  carrying  human 
organs for transplantation  

In  the  case  of  developments  towards  banking  and  farming  on  animals 
the  EGE  recommends 
carrying  human  organs 
establishing  a  strict  regulatory  framework  that  fully  takes  into  account 
safety, security and animal welfare. 

transplantation, 

for 

Prevent unregulated use of genome editing tools  

Given the  relative ease of use  of new genome editing technologies, and in 
order  to  prevent  an  unregulated  use  outside  the  regulated  professional 
context,  the  EGE  considers  that  potential  impact  on  (bio-)diversity  by 
generating new strains should be firmly regulated. 

Strengthen  ethical  oversight  of  practices  involving  reductions  of 
animals’ natural abilities 

Given  the  possibility  to  significantly  affect  natural  abilities  of  animals 
through  genome  editing  (sometimes  designated  as  ‘de-animalisation’)  and 
considering  that  animals  with  their  natural  characteristics  have  an  intrinsic 
value  (and  not  merely  an  instrumental  one),  the  EGE  recommends  that, 
even  outside  the  research  context,  the  purpose  of  such  reduction  be 
explicit,  transparent  and  balanced  and  subject  to  ethics  oversight  in  line 
with the above recommendations.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

Ensure the wellbeing of genome edited livestock animals 

In  a  number  of  instances,  genome  editing  of  animals  is  used  to  modify  or 
insert  traits  for  commercial  purposes.  The  EGE  expects  the  EU  and  its 
Member  States  to  ensure  that  the  health  and  wellbeing  of  the  concerned 
animals  is  assured  during  all  stages  of  the  procedures  and  of  the  animals’ 
life.  

Reconsider ethically contested industrial farming practices 

The  debate  on  genome  editing  also  raises  general  questions  around 
ethically  contested  industrial  farming  practices.  The  EGE  considers  wider 
reflection around sustainable and ethical food production models necessary. 

7.4  On genome editing in plants  

Carefully  assess  the  potentials  and  risks  of  genome  edited  plants 
for agriculture 

The EGE recognises that the introduction of new genome edited plants into 
the agricultural environment may be beneficial in providing products for an 
increasing  population  and  in  facing  the  impact  of  climate  change.  Their 
introduction  could  have  both  positive  or  negative  effects  on  product 
availability  (notably  food),  human  and  animal  health,  socio-economic 
conditions,  the  agricultural  environment  and  the  natural  environment  and 
care must be taken to minimise harm and maximise benefit. 

Develop  an  (eco)systems  approach  for  evaluating  the  costs  and 
benefits of genome edited crops 

The  EGE  recommends  a  systems  approach  to  the  evaluation  of  costs  and 
benefits  (including  the  impact  of  continuing  to  use  current  agricultural 
practice)  in  any  potential  future  use  of  genome  edited  crops.  Such  a 
broadened evaluation could take into account wider impacts on ecosystems 
and  agricultural  and  natural  biodiversity,  land  use,  economic  impact  and 
food  security. The EGE  recommends that regulation should be proportional 
to  the  risk  –  light  touch  regulation  should  be  used  where  the  modification 
achieved by genome editing is through techniques such as gene silencing or 
where the change in the plant could have been achieved naturally or where 
the  editing  involves  the  introduction  of  genetic  material  from  sexually 
compatible plants. Where the modification involves genes from non-sexually 
compatible  organisms  or  where  multiple  changes  in  the  genetic  material 

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 

91 

 
Ethics of Genome Editing 

have  occurred,  there  should  be  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  changes 
including  a  requirement  to  test  the  new  variety  in the  field  under  different 
conditions. 

Develop mechanisms to ensure corporate responsibility  

Companies  introducing  new  varieties,  regardless  of  method  or  provenance 
should  be  required  to  identify  the  impact  of  their  use  on  both  agricultural 
and natural biodiversity and the environment. 

Investigate  mechanisms  for  traceability  and  labelling  of  genome 
edited crops 

It  will  be  difficult  to  impose  a  requirement  for  ensuring  traceability  and 
labelling  requirements  where  exporting  countries  impose  no  requirements 
on  new  varieties  or  the  use  of  edited  varieties  as  the  starting  point  for 
newer varieties. The EGE recommends that traceability and labelling should 
only  be  required  where  the  modification  could  not  have  occurred  naturally 
through mutation or natural recombination with sexually compatible plants. 
Where  multiple  genes  or  those  from  non-related  organisms  are  inserted, 
tests could identify such plants, hence traceability and therefore labelling is 
possible. The Commission should investigate the use of patent registers as 
a method of identifying genome edited plants. It is recognised that the use 
of  current  varieties  of  plants  as  the  starting  material  for  newer  varieties 
may make such an approach impossible. 

Develop measures to support small actors 

The  EGE  acknowledges  that  any  additional  risk  assessment  requirements 
would  prove  costly  and  impose  a  high  regulatory  burden  which  may 
disproportionately impact small companies and research centres, preventing 
them  from  commercialising  products  or  utilising  patented  traits  from  other 
organisations.  Consideration  could  therefore  be  given  to  measures  to 
support  smaller  actors  in  steering  clear  of  or  in  engaging  with  these  novel 
technologies,  such  as  mechanisms  to  support  them  in  undertaking  risk 
assessments to enter the market. 

Pay  more  attention  to  public  debates  about  genome  edited 
agricultural products 

The  EGE  acknowledges  the  prevalence  of  public  concern  in  relation  to 
genetically  modified  organisms  including  the  lack  of  public  dialogue  and 
informed debate, which accompanied the introduction of GMO products, and 

92  

European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 

Ethics of Genome Editing 

calls for more attention to public dialogue on the question of genome edited 
plants. The  EGE cannot endorse a model which assumes that it is the lack 
of information alone which shapes the public debate. 

7.5  On gene drives 

Acknowledge epistemic and other uncertainties 

There are many aspects about the systemic effects of gene drives that are 
not yet known. Ecosystems, as complex systems, have emergent properties 
that  cannot  be  comprehensively  simulated.  These  unknowns  should  be 
acknowledged at the outset of processes of deliberation and regulation, and 
be openly discussed. Because of these uncertainties, gene drives should not 
be  promoted  as  a  panacea  for  public  health  and  other  problems.  Before 
gene drives are considered as a solution, other measures should have been 
exhausted. Moreover, gene drives should only be used when the goals and 
underpinning  values  have  been  deliberated  and  democratically  decided 
upon. 

Use gene drives in ways that are based on shared values 

The  EGE  urges  all  actors  to  make  explicit,  and  discuss  openly,  the  values 
underpinning plans to use gene drives, and the purposes for which they are 
used,  proactively  trying  to  include  a  diverse  and  broad  range  of 
perspectives.  Equity  and  social  justice  considerations  are  of  particular 
importance in this context. 

Regulate, monitor after release and have mitigation plans in place 

The EGE recommends, throughout the process of using organisms modified 
by gene drives, to monitor their release into the environment on the  basis 
of  a  mitigation  plan  for  risks  and  harms.  Eco-technologies  –  such  as,  but 
not  limited  to,  gene  drives  –  should  also  be  subject  to  a  consolidated 
registry and to a coherent regulatory framework of governance as described 
above. 

Retain stock of original organisms  

The  EGE  recommends,  because  of  the  uncertainties  regarding  the 
traceability  and  reversibility  of  gene  drives,  to  retain  stock  of  original, 
unmodified organisms.

Ethics of Genome Editing 

ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OPINION 

The  EGE  develops  its  Opinions  upon  requests  from  the  Commission,  as 
stipulated in Commission Decision 2016/835. The request for advice on the 
ethics  of  genome  editing  was  communicated  to  the  EGE  in  a  letter  from 
Carlos  Moedas,  Commissioner  for  Research  and  Innovation,  in  2018.  The 
Commissioner  expressed  “tremendous  need  for  your  advice  both  on  the 
bigger  picture  of  this  issue  and  on  specific  aspects  of  concern,”  including 
“the  dividing  lines  which  otherwise  limit  the  ethical  analysis:  human  and 
therapeutic  and 
non-human;  somatic  and  germline;  research  and 
enhancement  purposes;  agricultural,  health,  environmental  and  further 
areas;  existing  and  future  technologies  and  implications,”  and  specific 
aspects such as “gene editing applied to animals as well as gene editing in 
the context of biodiversity and ecosystems.”  

The EGE collectively worked towards this Opinion and its recommendations, 
with  Anne  Cambon-Thomsen,  Julian  Kinderlerer,  Barbara  Prainsack  and 
Christiane Woopen as rapporteurs for its core chapters. Detailed discussions 
took  place  in  the  EGE’s  regular  meetings,  directing  the  drafting  of  the 
rapporteurs.  

At the same time, the  EGE also  responded to  the pressing need for advice 
on  the  broader  ethical  and  societal  dimensions  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic 
and  issued  a  Statement  on  European  solidarity  and  the  protection  of 
fundamental rights in the COVID-19 pandemic at the outset of the crisis (in 
April  2020),  a  Joint  Statement  on  scientific  advice  to  European  policy 
makers  concerning  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (in  June  2020)  and  a  Joint 
Opinion  on  improving  pandemics  preparedness  and  management  (in 
November 2020).  

The development  of the present  Opinion involved  several relevant services 
of the European Commission and a wide range of stakeholders and experts, 
many of whom presented their expertise and views to the EGE in dedicated 
hearings. A central part of this, pursuant to Commission Decision 2016/835, 
was  also  the  Open  Round  Table,  which  took  place  on  16  October  2019, 
together with the International Dialogue on Bioethics and Ethics of Science 
and  New  Technologies  (ID-BEST),  which  took  place  on  17  October  2019. 
These  events  emphasised  awareness  raising  and  the  importance  of 
structural  public  engagement  on  genome  editing  and  on  all  its  cognate 
ethical questions,  with the manifold perspectives  arising from them having 
informed the preparation of this Opinion.

The advent of new genome editing technologies such as CRISPR/CasX 
has opened new dimensions of what and how genetic interventions into 
our world are possible. In this Opinion, the European Group on Ethics 
in Science and New Technologies (EGE) addresses the profound ethical 
questions raised and revived by them. 

The Opinion analyses various domains of application, from human health 
to animal experimentation, from livestock breeding to crop variety, and 
to gene drives. With its wide view across areas, the Opinion identifies 
underlying and overarching issues that deserve our concerted attention, 
among them, the different meanings that ought to be attributed to 
humanness, naturalness or diversity. It also formulates recommendations, 
including inclusive societal deliberation of global scope about genome 
editing, a call for the development of international standards for its ethical 
and safe use, warnings about narrow conceptualisations of the ethical 
issues at stake, the establishment of a platform for exchange and debate 
on heritable human genome editing, and more, also domain-specific, 
propositions.

Stem  cells  are  cells  that  can  divide  to  produce  either  cells  like  themselves  (self-
renewal), or cells of one or several specific differentiated types.  Stem cells are not yet
fully differentiated and therefore can reconstitute one or several types of tissues.

(cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:21)(cid:17) :KDW(cid:3)DUH(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)GLIIHUHQW(cid:3)NLQGV(cid:3)RI(cid:3)VWHP(cid:3)FHOOV"

Different  kinds  of  stem  cells  can  be  distinguished  according  to  their  potential  to
differentiate.  They are progenitor, multipotent or pluripotent stem cells.

•  3URJHQLWRU(cid:3) VWHP(cid:3) FHOOV  are  those  whose  terminally  differentiated  progeny
consist  of  a  single  cell  type  only.    For  instance,  epidermal  stem  cells  or
spermatogonial  stem  cells  can  differentiate  respectively 
into  only
keratinocytes and spermatozoa.

•  0XOWLSRWHQW(cid:3)VWHP(cid:3)FHOOV are those which can give rise to several terminally
differentiated cell types constituting a specific tissue or organ.  Examples
are  skin  stem  cells  which  give  rise  to  epidermal  cells,  sebaceous  glands
and  hair  follicles  or  haematopoietic  stem  cells,  which  give  rise  to  all  the
diverse  blood  cells  (erythrocytes,  lymphocytes,  antibody-producing  cells
and so on), and neural stem cells, which give rise to all the cell types in the
nervous system, including glia (sheath cells), and the many different types
of neurons.

•  3OXULSRWHQW(cid:3) VWHP(cid:3) FHOOV  are  able  to  give  rise  to  all  different  cell  types  LQ
YLWUR(cid:17) Nevertheless, they cannot on their own form an embryo.  Pluripotent
stem cells, which are isolated from primordial germ cells in the foetus, are
called:  embryonic  germ  cells  ("EG  cells").    Those  stem  cells,  which  are
isolated from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst-stage embryo, are called:
embryonic stem cells ("ES cells”).

It should be noted that scientists do not yet all agree on the  terminology concerning
these types of stem cells.

these stem cells are essential to the formation of tissues and organs.  In the adult, they
replenish  tissues  whose  cells  have  a  limited  life  span,  for  instance  skin  stem  cells,
intestinal stem cells and haematopoietic stem cells.  In the absence of stem cells, our
various  tissues  would  wear  out  and  we  would  die.    They  are  more  abundant  in  the
foetus than in the adult. For instance haematopoietic stem cells can be derived  from
adult bone marrow but they are particularly abundant in umbilical cord blood.

there are:

•  $GXOW(cid:3) VWHP(cid:3) FHOOV(cid:29)  progenitor  and  multipotent  stem  cells  are  present  in  adults.
Mammals  appear  to  contain some  20  major  types  of  somatic  stem  cells  that  can
generate liver, pancreas, bone and cartilage but they are rather difficult to find and
isolate.  For instance, access to neural stem cells is limited since they are located
in  the  brain.  Haematopoietic  stem  cells  are  present  in  the  blood,  but  their
harvesting  requires  stimulatory  treatment  of  the  donor’s  bone  marrow.    By  and
large, adult stem cells are rare and do not have the same developmental potential
as embryonic or(cid:3)foetal stem cells(cid:17)

-(cid:3)Haematopoietic stem cells can be retrieved from the umbilical cord blood.

-  Foetal  tissue  obtained  after  pregnancy  termination  can  be  used  to  derive
multipotent stem cells like neural stem cells which can be isolated from foetal
neural  tissue  and  multiplied  in  culture,  though  they  have  a  limited  life  span.
Foetal  tissue  can  also  give  rise  to  pluripotent  EG  cells  isolated  from  the
primordial germ cells of the foetus.

•  6WHP(cid:3)FHOOV(cid:3)RI(cid:3)HPEU\RQLF(cid:3)RULJLQ(cid:29)(cid:3)Pluripotent ES cells are those which are derived
from an embryo at the blastocyst stage. Embryos  could be produced either by LQ
YLWUR(cid:3)fertilisation (IVF) or by transfer of an adult nucleus to an enucleated egg cell
or oocyte (somatic cell nuclear transfer – SCNT).

own  producing  for  example  identical  twins  or  quadruplets.  They  are  totally
unspecialised and have the capacity to differentiate into any of the cells which will
constitute the foetus as well as the placenta and membranes around the foetus.

embryo on their own.

•  $W(cid:3)ILYH(cid:3)WR(cid:3)VHYHQ(cid:3)GD\V after fertilisation (cid:11)EODVWRF\VW(cid:3)VWDJH(cid:12), a hollow appears in the
centre  of  the  morula,  and  the  cells  constituting  the  embryo  start  to  be
differentiated into inner and outer cells:

-  The  outer  cells  will  constitute  the  tissues  around  the  foetus,  including  the
placenta.

- The inner cells (20 to 30 cells) will give rise to the foetus itself as well as to
some of the surrounding tissues. If these inner cells are isolated and grown in
the presence of certain chemical substances (growth factors), SOXULSRWHQW ES
cells can be derived. ES cells are pluripotent, not totipotent since they cannot
develop into an embryo on their own. If they are transferred to a uterus, they
would neither implant nor develop into an embryo.

Scientists have been working with mouse embryonic stem cells LQ(cid:3)YLWUR(cid:3)for more
than 20 years, noting very early their remarkable capacity to divide. Some mouse
ES  cell  lines  have  been  cultured  for  more  than  10  years,  while  retaining  their
ability to differentiate.

somatic cells. For instance neural differentiated mouse ES cells when transplanted
into  a  rat  spinal  cord  several  days  after  a  traumatic  injury  can  reconstitute
neuronal  tissue  resulting  in  the  (partial)  recovery  of  hindlimb  co-ordinated
motility. Similarly, selected cardiomyocytes obtained from differentiating ES cells
can  be  grafted  into  the  heart  of  dystrophic  mice  to  effect  myocardial  repair.
Whether the same cellular derivatives when obtained from adult stem cells would
be able to correct for the deficiencies induced in those animal models remains to
be determined.

Stem  cells  in  tissues  such  as  skin  or  blood  are  able  to  repair  the  tissues  throughout
life.    By  contrast,  the  nervous  system  has  a  very  limited  capacity  for  self-repair
because  the  neural  stem  cells  in  the  adult  brain  are  few  in  number  and  have  a  poor
capacity to generate new neurons for instance to repair injury.

that  the  transplantation  of  neural  cells  derived  from  the  human  foetus  can  have  a
therapeutic effect, with an important reduction of the symptoms of the disease in the
treated  patients.    The  clinical  improvement  among  these  patients  has  been  observed
for 6-24 months after transplantation and in some cases for 5-10 years.  It has recently
been  shown  that  10  years  after  the  transplantation  surgery,  the  transplanted  neural
cells were still alive and producing dopamine, the compound which is deficient in the
brain of patients with Parkinson’s disease.

availability  of  neural  foetal  tissue  is  very  limited.    Five  to  six  aborted  foetuses  are
needed to provide enough neural tissue to treat one Parkinson’s patient.  That is why
new sources of neural cells have been explored in some countries such as the US and
Sweden.  The aim is to derive neural stem cells from foetuses: these stem cells could
be induced to SUROLIHUDWH LQ(cid:3)FXOWXUH, providing much greater amounts of neural tissue

The  transplantation  of  human  haematopoietic  stem  cells  is  routinely  used  to  restore

•  $GXOW(cid:3)VWHP(cid:3)FHOOV(cid:29) they can be retrieved under anaesthesia, from the bone marrow
of donors, or from the patients themselves (before chemotherapy). Haematopoietic
stem cells can also be retrieved directly from the blood, which requires a treatment
to  induce  the  passage  of  stem  cells  from  the  bone  marrow  into  the  blood
circulation.

•  6WHP(cid:3)FHOOV(cid:3)RI(cid:3)IRHWDO(cid:3)RULJLQ(cid:29) haematopoietic stem cells can be  retrieved  from the
umbilical cord blood at birth, though  care  must  be  taken to  ensure that  the baby
receives enough cord blood. There are at present cord blood banks designated to
facilitate  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation.  The  systematic  retrieval  and
cryopreservation of cord blood, at birth, has even been considered in order to have
autologous  stem  cells  available  in  case  of  later  need.  Stem  cells  of  foetal  origin
give rise to less rejection reaction than adult stem cells.

Nevertheless,  bone  marrow  cells  with  such  extraordinary  malleability  are  extremely
rare.  In any case, these recent findings still require to be substantiated.

•  %DVLF(cid:3)GHYHORSPHQWDO(cid:3)ELRORJ\. Culturing of human stem cells offers insights that
cannot be studied directly in the human embryo or understood through the use of
animal models. For instance, basic research on stem cells could help to understand
the causes of birth defects, infertility and pregnancy loss. It could also be useful to
give a better understanding of normal and abnormal human development.

be engineered  to incorporate human  mutated  genes  known  to  be  associated  with
particular diseases and then used to make transgenic mouse strains. If such mice
express the pathology of the human disease, this confirms the hypothesis that the
gene  is  involved  with  the  etiology  of  the  disease.  This  strategy  also  yields  an
animal  model  of  the  human  disease  which  has  in  most  cases  a  much  better
predictability for the human situation than more conventional animal models. One
of the most illustrative examples of that method is its use in order to address the
potential causes of Alzheimer’s disease.

is  being  actively  pursued,  mostly  in  the  mouse,  with  the  aim  of  directing  the
differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to produce pure populations of particular
cell types to be used for the repair of diseased or damaged  tissues.  For instance,
the aim would be to produce cardiac muscle cells to be used to alleviate ischaemic
heart  disease,  pancreatic  islet  cells  for  treatment  of  diabetes  (juvenile  onset
diabetes  mellitus),  liver  cells  for  hepatitis,  neural  cells  for  degenerative  brain
diseases  such  as  Parkinson’s  disease,  and  perhaps  even  cells  for  treating  some
forms of cancer. The transplantation of stem cells could also help, for example, to
repair spinal cord damage which occurs frequently, mainly following trauma (for
instance  car  accidents)  and  is  responsible  for  paraplegia.  Results  of  that  kind  of

At national level, stem cell research is not regulated as such.

- Ireland is the only country of the EU whose Constitution affirms the right to
life of the “unborn” and that this right is equal to that of the mother.

- In some Member States no legislation on embryo research exists. This is the
case  of  Belgium  and  of  the  Netherlands,  where  embryo  research  is
nevertheless carried out. In Portugal however, in the absence of legislation, no
embryo research seems to be performed. This also seems to be the case in Italy
although artificial reproductive techniques are widely practised.

- Where embryo research is legislated, legislation either prohibits any kind of
embryo  research  (Austria,  Germany),  or  authorises  this  research  under
specified  conditions  (Finland,  Spain,  Sweden,  and  UK).  In  France,  where
embryo  research  is  still  prohibited,  the  law  authorises  “the  study  of  embryos
without prejudicing their integrity” as well as preimplantation diagnosis.

- In some countries the Constitutional Courts have dealt with the use of human
embryos  (judgement  of  the  French  Constitutional  Court  of  July  27,  1994  on
Bioethics, and judgement of the Spanish Constitutional Court of July 10, 1999
on the legislation concerning assisted human reproduction techniques).

Congress has been adopting each year a provision in the Appropriation Bill to prohibit
public  funding  for  embryo  research.  Thus,  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)
cannot carry out embryo research,  which, in the  absence  of legislation,  remains free
and beyond control in the private sector.

New discoveries concerning the culturing of human stem cells in 1998 have led to the
reopening of the debate. The National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC) issued
a  report  on  September  1999;  hearings  took  place  in  1999  and  2000  before  the
competent  Committees  of  the  US  Congress  and  finally  the Clinton administration

12

proposed  that,  under  certain  conditions,  the  funding  of  research  to  derive  and  study
human ES cells be permitted. New  guidelines  of  the NIH  were  published  in  August
2000  according to which  research  on  human  ES cells can be publicly funded if two
conditions  are  respected.  First,  the  cells  must  be  taken  from  frozen  spare  embryos
from fertility clinics and already destined to be discarded; second, Federal funds could
not  be  used  to  destroy  the  embryos  to  obtain  the  cells;  privately  funded  researchers
will have to pass them on to Federally supported scientists.

its  ethical  acceptability  and  of  the  limits  and  conditions  for  such  research.
Embryo  research  has  been  extensively  debated  in  the  context  of  research
carried out to improve IVF as a treatment for infertility.  Embryonic stem cell
research raises the following specific additional ethical questions:

research that involved destroying embryos, if allowed, was limited to research
on  reproduction,  contraception  or  congenital  diseases.  With  human  stem  cell
research, a much wider scope of research is being considered.

embryos  used  for  research  were  destroyed  after  the  research  was  completed
and  therefore  were  never  used  for  fertility  treatment.    What  remained  was
additional  knowledge.    Human  embryonic  stem  cell  research  is  aimed  at
creating  cell  lines  with  appropriate  characteristics,  in  terms  of  purity  and
specificity. There is thus continuity from the embryonic cells to the therapeutic
material obtained by culture.

concerns.  The  ethical  acceptability  of stem cell research depends not only on

The  Group  deems  it  essential  to  underline  the  sensitivity  attached  to  the  use  of
embryonic stem cells, since this use may change our vision of the respect due to the
human embryo.

highly  selective  and  based  on  a  case  by  case  approach,  while  ensuring  maximum
transparency. This must apply whether the research in question is carried out by either
the public or the private sector.

The  speed  with  which  researchers,  throughout  the  world,  are  moving  to  test
stem cells in patients is remarkable, even if ES cell transplantation is unlikely
to be attempted in the near future. Clinical trials with stem cells other than ES
carried  out  on  patients  suffering  from  severe  conditions  such  as  Parkinson’s
disease, heart disease or diabetes raise the following issues:

Free and informed consent is required not only from the donor but  also  from
the  recipient  as  stated  in  the  Group's  opinion  on  Human  Tissue  Banking
(21/07/1998). In each case, it is necessary to inform the donor (the woman or
the couple) of the possible use of the embryonal cells for the specific purpose
in question before requesting consent.

Risk-benefit assessment is crucial in stem cell research, as in any research, but
is  more  difficult  as  the  uncertainties  are  considerable  given  the  gaps  in  our
knowledge.  Attempts  to  minimise  the  risks  and  increase  the  benefits  should
include optimising the strategies for safety. It is not enough to test the cultured
stem cells or tissues derived from them for bacteria, viruses or toxicity. Safety
and  security  aspects  are  of  utmost  importance  in  the  transplantation  of
genetically modified cells and when stem cells are derived from somatic cells.
For  example,  the  risks  that  transplanted  stem  cells  cause  abnormalities  or
induce creation of tumours or cancer have to be assessed. It is important that
the  potential  benefits  for  the  patients  should  be  taken  into  account  but  not
exaggerated.  The  grounds  of  a  precautionary  approach  need  to  be  taken  into
account.

The possibility that irreversible and potentially harmful changes are introduced
in clinical applications of stem cell research should be minimised. Techniques
enhancing the possibilities of reversibility should  be  used whenever  possible.
If,  for  example,  genetically  modified  cells  were  encapsulated  when  they  are
transplanted in order to stimulate neural cell growth, it should be possible for
the procedure to be reversed if something goes wrong.

It  is  urgent  to  outline  strategies  and  specific  requirements  for  the  best
evaluation  of  ethically  sound  and  safe  use  of  stem  cells  as  means  of  therapy
(gene  therapy,  transplantation,  etc.).  Such  an  evaluation  should  be  done  in
collaboration  with  the  European  Agency  for  the  Evaluation  of  Medicinal
Products.

Steps must be taken to protect and preserve the identity of both the donor and
the recipient in stem cell research and use. As stated in the EGE’s Opinion on
Human  Tissue  Banking  (21/07/1998):  "in  the  interests  of  anonymity,  it  is
prohibited  to  disclose  information  that  could  identify  the  donor,  and  the
recipient.  In  general,  the  donor  should not know  the identity of  the recipient,
nor should the recipient know the identity of the donor".

Procurement and storage of stem cells in stem cell banks leads to the collection
and  storage  of  a  growing  number  of  personal  and  familial  data.  Cell  banks
should be regulated at European level in order to facilitate the implementation
of a precautionary  approach.  If  unsatisfactory side  effects  occur,  it  should  be
possible  to  trace  donor  and  recipient  and  to  reach  their  medical  files.
Traceability must be one of the conditions required for the authorisation of cell
banks at national or European level.

In  order  to  reconcile  the  traceability  requirement  and  the  need  to  protect  the
donor’s rights - medical confidentiality and privacy - cell banks must take the
necessary steps to protect confidentiality of the data.

The  potential  for  coercive  pressure  should  not  be  underestimated  when  there
are financial incentives. Embryos as well as cadaveric foetal tissue must not be
bought or sold not even offered for sale. Measures should be taken to prevent
such commercialisation.

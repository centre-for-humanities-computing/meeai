Introduction:
The European Group on Ethics

of modern developments in agricultural technologies 3 
(No 24 – 17 December 2008).

The  Group  is  currently  working  on  an  opinion  on  the 
ethics of synthetic biology, to be submitted to the Com-
mission by October 2009.

When preparing its opinions, the EGE engages in a broad 
consultation, involving individual experts, representati-
ves of European institutions, of other international insti-
tutions and of civil society and the Chairs of the national 
Ethics  Councils  in  the  European  Union  Member  States. 
A round table was organised by the European Group on 
Ethics on 19 May 2009 in order to promote a transparent 
dialogue  between  parties  representing  many  different 
interests. This report gives a summary of the presenta-
tions and discussions which took place in Brussels.

The European Group on Ethics (EGE) is an independent, 
pluralist  and  multidisciplinary  body  which  advises  the 
European Commission on ethical aspects of science and 
new  technologies  in  connection  with  preparation  and 
implementation of Community legislation or policies.

The Group is made up of 15 independent experts ap-
pointed by the Commission for their expertise and per-
sonal qualities.

In  December  1997  the  European  Commission  set  up 
the European Group on Ethics to succeed the Group of 
Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnologies 
(GAEIB 1991-1997). During its first term (1998-2000) the 
EGE  gave  opinions  on  subjects  as  diverse  as  human 
tissue  banking,  human  embryo  research,  personal 
health data in the information society, doping in sport 
and human stem cell research.

In  April  2001  the  Commission  appointed  12  members 
for the period 2001-2004. During its second term, the 
Group published opinions on the ethical aspects of pa-
tenting inventions involving human stem cells (opinion 
No  16  –  7  May  2002),  clinical  research  in  developing 
countries (No 17 – 4 February 2003), genetic testing in 
the workplace (No 18 – 28 July 2003) and umbilical cord 
blood banking (No 19 – 16 March 2004).

On 11 May 2005 the Commission decided to renew the 
Group’s  mandate  for  a  further  four-year  period.  For 
this third term, the EGE was increased in size from 12 
to 15 members. In the same year the Group published 
its  opinion  on  the  ethical  aspects  of  ICT  implants  in 
the human body (No 20 – 16 March 2005). So far in this 
term the EGE has given opinions on ethics and nano-
medicine 1 (No 21 – 17 January 2007), on ethics review 
of FP7 human embryonic stem cells projects 2 (No 22 – 
13 July 2007), on the ethical aspects of animal cloning 
for food supply (No 23 – 16 January 2008) and on ethics

of Synthetic Biology

Round-Table Report

1.  Main goal of the round table

The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Tech-
nologies (EGE) is preparing an opinion on the ethics of 
synthetic biology, to be submitted to the Commission 
by October 2009. As part of its preparatory work, the EGE 
held an open round-table debate on the issues raised by 
synthetic biology. The round table was organised by the 
Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA).

As  was  the  case  for  previous  EGE  opinions  and  in  ac-
cordance  with  the  Commission  Decision  on  the  EGE’s 
mandate  (Decision  2005/383/EC),  a  public  round  table 
was organised to debate openly the ethical, social and 
legal  implications  of  synthetic  biology.  The  main  goal 
was to give stakeholders an opportunity to provide the 
EGE  with  relevant  data,  considerations  and  viewpoints 
before finalisation of Opinion 25, which is to be adopted 
in October 2009.

2.  The Round-Table

The round table took the form of a series of contributions 
from speakers representing different interest groups, fol-
lowed by a debate between the audience, the speakers 
and the EGE members.

To  secure  maximum  participation  by  experts,  an  open 
invitation  was  sent  to  relevant  stakeholders  (in  the  EU 
and  beyond),  members  of  the  national  Ethics  Councils 
(from  the  27  EU  Member  States),  consumer  organisa-
tions,  coordinators  of  EU-funded  projects  on  synthetic 
biology  (SB),  environmental  protection  organisations, 
academics, religious groups, industries, NGOs, etc.

An open invitation was published on the Internet to at-
tract full and free participation by all interested parties. 
Around 80 people attended this event. Several organisa-
tional difficulties had to be overcome, due to the closure 
of the Berlaymont building because of a fire.

The  round  table  was  opened  by  Professor  Goran 
Hermerén, Chairman of the European Group on Eth-
ics in Science and New Technologies. Three experts 

gave presentations on the ethical and societal impli-
cations of SB:

•	

•	

	Hugh Whittall (Director of the Nuffield Council on 
Bioethics, UK);
	Dr  Eleonore  Pauwels  (Synthetic  Biology  Project, 
Woodrow  Wilson  International  Center  for  Scholars, 
Washington D.C., USA);

•	 Dr Bart Walhout (Rathenau Institute, NL).

Prof. Goran Hermerén welcomed the participants and 
gave  a  short  introduction  on  ethical  issues  that  arise 
from synthetic biology. He underlined that this research 
sector had a wide range of potential applications from 
medicine  to  biofuels  and  from  new  materials  to  bio-
remedies. Prof. Hermerén stressed that each field of ap-
plication of synthetic biology had different ethical, social 
and legal implications and explained that the regulatory 
framework to consider with a view to promoting respon-
sible use of synthetic biology included, inter alia, EU and 
international regulations on the ethical issues on differ-
ent uses of SB and their societal implications.

3.  The speakers’ contributions

The complexity of the ethical issues surrounding use of 
synthetic biology was summarised by Hugh Whittall, Di-
rector of the UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Mr Whittall 
underlined that there was no internationally agreed defi-
nition of SB, but that this research sector could be seen as 
a construction of novel biological networks or organisms 
with bespoke properties, using standardised biological 
parts that code unknown functions.

Mr Whittall said that the creation of minimal genomes, ar-
tificial cells, standardising parts and pathways (biobricks 
for  artificially  expanded  genetic  information  systems) 
were all areas covered by ongoing SB research and that 
potential  applications  of  SB  could  include  bio sensors, 
bacteria to produce an anti-malaria drug, bacteria to pro-
duce spider silk, fatty acids for biodiesel fuel, etc.

Mr Whittall also addressed biosafety concerns raised by 
SB  and  explained  that  existing  risk  assessment  meth-

7

ods  in  the  EU  (GMO-oriented)  might  not  properly  ad-
dress the specifics of SB products. The EU approach to 
GMO biosafety was based on comparison between the 
‘natural’ component and the one resulting from insert-
ing a hexogen genetic element into an existing gene. SB 
products, he pointed out, were the result of new synthe-
sised components or insertion of multiple genes. They 
therefore  needed  different  risk  assessment  procedures 
than provided for in the current EU biosafety regulation. 
Mr Whittall also addressed the biosecurity implications 
of possible use of SB for production of virulent modified 
pathogens,  thus  raising  biosecurity  and  anti-terrorism 
considerations. According to Mr Whittall, dual-use issues 
were significant in the field of SB.

Finally,  Mr  Whittall  enumerated  several  topics  that 
needed  proper  analysis  for  an  ethical  assessment  of 
SB,  such  as:  the  economic  dimension  of  SB  and  its 
potential  for  technological  divide  and  exploitation 
of  developing  countries;  the  ‘playing  God’  argument 
and the precautionary principle; risk assessment con-
siderations; public reactions and risk perception; gov-
ernance of SB, etc.

ty,  biosecurity  and  ethics  (creation  of  life)  issues.  She 
argued that the current focus of the American press on 
biosecurity issues and of the European press on biosafe-
ty  and  environmental  impact  could  lead  to  diverging 
public opinion on the risks and, therefore, on potential 
regulation of this field. She also reported on the results 
of  a  public  survey  on  SB  recently  conducted  in  the  US 
which clearly demonstrated no public support for reg-
ulation  by  industry  (soft-regulation);  furthermore,  nor 
were public bodies trusted by the general public in that 
respect. SB was often presented by scientists as a clear 
solution  for  environmental  protection,  but  new  meth-
ods  of  communication  were  needed  to  spark  a  proper 
public  debate  about  the  legitimacy  of  this  technology 
and its different uses.

Dr  Pauwels  also  argued  that  cultural  and  social  factors 
played a key role in public perception of SB. Public percep-
tion in the USA was generally positive towards SB applica-
tions in the energy and environmental protection spheres 
(e.g. biofuels and bioremedies for pollution), whilst at the 
same  time  generally  reluctant  to  accept  biomedical  ap-
plications due to the artificial nature of SB products.

Dr  Eleonore  Pauwels 
(Synthetic  Biology  Project, 
Woodrow  Wilson  International  Center  for  Scholars, 
Washington D.C., USA) addressed issues related to pub-
lic perception and press coverage of SB. She reported 
on data from a recent study 4 conducted as part of the 
synthetic biology project at the Wilson Center, compar-
ing press coverage in the United States and in Europe 5 
between 2003 and 2008.

Dr  Pauwels  explained  that  in  the  US  press  51  %  of  the 
articles on this subject focused on potential benefits of 
SB, whereas in the European press only 26 % of articles 
addressed this side, focusing instead mainly on biosafe-

Dr Bart Walhout (Rathenau Institute, NL) addressed so-
cietal  concerns  about  different  uses  of  SB.  He  argued 
that the ethics of SB were linked to its applications and 
expected  goals  and  pointed  to  biofuels  and  biomedi-
cine as sectors that could benefit from future SB prod-
ucts. He stressed that the ethical questions raised by SB 
were not substantially different from the ones posed by 
genetic or molecular bioengineering, but that biosafety, 
biosecurity  and  IPR  considerations  were  inherent  to 
responsible use of research in this sector.

Dr Walhout underlined the need to hold a public debate 
on  this  technology  at  the  earliest  stage  of  its  develop-

ment  and  before  marketing  SB  products  (biomedicine, 
environmental protection, energy production, etc.).

Dr  Walhout  said  that  governance  of  SB  was  being  de-
bated internationally, with some advocating extending 
the existing biotechnology governance frame to SB and 
others  supporting  the  need  to  create  new  governance 
systems for the different uses of SB.

In his opinion, the SB sector depended on societal accept-
ance. He advocated opening public debates on a number 
of issues, inter alia production of synthesised higher life 
forms (a synthetic bacterium – Synthia – or synthetic hu-
man genome was expected by 2014), biosecurity (human 
pathogens) and patenting of SB products.

4.  The general debate

Following  the  presentations  a  debate  on  the  ethics  of 
synthetic biology was held. Issues addressed included:

•	

•	

•	

•	

The	level	of	risks	to	accept	in	a	proper	governance	
system  for  environmental  and  biomedical  uses  of 
SB and the role played by political decisions in risk 
management procedures.

The	need	to	promote	democratic	participation	by	a	
number of stakeholders in the design of SB R&D.

The	 question	 whether	 biosecurity	 measures	 should	
be conceived for SB and whether they should also be 
extended to SB research activities which are currently 
not covered by the Biological Weapons Convention.

The	 risks	 inherent	 in	 defining	 an	 arbitrary	 distinc-
tion  between  defensive  and  aggressive  uses  of  SB, 
because  of  the  potential  dual  uses  of  technology 
promoted for defensive (and preventive) biosecuri-
ty. The need to control use of new lethal pathogens 
created for vaccine production to avoid maleficent 
uses by third parties. Access to biological knowledge 
on  pathogens  for  synthesis  of  lethal  bio-agents 
coupled with technology that was much easier to 
use than other biotechnologies.

•	 Holding	a	public	debate	on	SB,	based	on	‘better’	life	
issues,  might  distort  the  discussion  on  instrumen-
talisation of life.

The	limits	of	the	security	level	classification	system	
in biological laboratories and the potential for trade 
in synthesised viruses for terrorism purposes. 

The	 need	 to	 address	 the	 public	 morality	 clause	 in	
the current EU system for patenting SB products.

The	need	to	address	ontological	questions	in	SB	and	
its attempts to modify life.

The	need	to	design	and	implement	mechanisms	for	
public  debate  on  SB,  with  a  proper  balance  of  sci-
entific, ethical and social considerations, bearing in 
mind  the  minor  role  the  EU  is  currently  playing  in 
development of this research sector (the risk of cre-
ating public over-estimation of the risks, compared 
with other countries (USA, for example).

The	need	to	apply	the	existing	safety	measures	on	
SB (safety measures for research and for marketing 
biotechnological products), while exploring whether 
existing regulations on biosafety (GMOs) could effec-
tively assess SB products.

The	need	to	promote	embedding	of	ethics	in	both	
SB  policy  design  and  research  practice  (including 
education  and  vocational  training  on  ethics  for  SB 
researchers).

The	 distinction	 between	 natural  and  artificial  SB 
products and the value attributed to the expected 
results,  both  of  which  would  imply  public  involve-
ment  rather  than  SB  being  circumscribed  to  the 
scientific community.

The	need	to	address	the	concept	of	human	enhance-
ments by means of SB or the long-term consequenc-
es for the biosphere.

The	 need	 to	 clarify	 the	 role	 which	 social	 sciences	
and  humanities  will  play  in  the  global  debate  on, 

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

9

and  proper  assessment  of,  SB  in  order  to  avoid  in-
strumentalisation and misunderstanding.

•	

•	

•	

The	need	to	emphasise	the	role	which	SB	plays	in	ba-
sic biology (heuristic tool for a better understanding 
of biological phenomena) and to assess the ethics of 
SB  differently,  depending  whether  it  was  intended 
for market purposes (SB products) or as a branch of 
basic biology.

The	need	properly	to	address	potential	amateur	uses	
of SB with possible unintentional hazardous implica-
tions.

The	 need	 to	 promote	 interdisciplinary	 approaches	
to SB, making ELSA studies (on the Ethical, Legal and 
Social Aspects) an integral component.

•	

•	

The	 need	 to	 clarify	 the	 links	 and	 divergences	 be-
tween  SB  and  other  emerging  technologies  (such 
as converging technologies or nanosciences) and to 
analyse  potential  clashes  between  the  technology 
market and sustainable development. 

The	 need	 to	 address	 the	 global	 dimension	 of	 SB	
(spanning  the  USA,  Asia  and  the  EU)  by  avoiding 
hype about both the potential and the risks of SB.

The  video  of  the  round  table  is  available  on  the  EGE

President of the European Group on Ethics

Professor  Göran  Hermerén  is  professor  of  medical 
ethics at the faculty of medicine, Lund University. He is 
President of the European Group on Ethics since 2002.

He  is  a  member  of  the  Swedish  National  Council  on 
Medical Ethics and has served on many governmental 
commissions and as referee for international journals.

Professor  Göran  Hermerén  is  chairman  of  the  ethics 
committee  of  the  Swedish  Research  Council,  Stock-
holm  and  of  the  Advisory  Board  of  the  German  ref-
erence  Centre  for  Ethics  in  the  Life  Sciences  DRZE  in

Welcome Address by 
Professor Göran Hermerén,
EGE President

In May 28, 2008 President José Manuel Barroso asked the 
EGE to issue an Opinion on the ethical, legal and social 
implications that may derive from synthetic biology (SB). 
In his letter the President advocated that ‘(…) the debate 
about the legitimacy of engineering new life forms has 
mainly focused on safety issues and a work on the ethi-
cal,  legal  and  social  implications  that  may  derive  from 
this specific use of biotechnology is still missing.’

The EGE is aware that synthetic biology concerns philo-
sophical, anthropological, ethical, legal,  social and sci-
entific  aspects,  it  is  equally  aware  that  the  converging 
of multiple technologies in SB, each of them based on 
different  scientific  paradigms,  increases  the  complex-
ity of the ethics assessment of synthetic biology and its 
products. The EGE has however agreed that, apart from 
safety  issues  raised  by  SB,  an  ethical,  legal,  and  politi-
cal governance of synthetic biology is needed in the EU 
and  worldwide  in  order  to  secure  that  the  interests  of 
science  and  society  are  equally  respected.  The  Group 
has therefore accepted President Barroso’s request and 
decided  to  focus  its  Opinion  on  the  ethical,  legal  and 
social  implications  of  SB,  with  particular  emphasis  on 
synthetic genomics.

As for the other EGE Opinions, and following  the EGE 
Remit, the public round table today will promote open 
dialogue  between  the  EGE  and  parties  representing 
different  stakeholders  groups  dealing  with  synthetic 
biology. The participants today include experts of the 
field,  members  of  the  National  Ethics  Councils  (EU  27 
Member  States),  farmers’  associations,  consumers’  or-
ganisations,  coordinators  of  European  Union  funded 
projects  on  synthetic  biology  (SB),  environment  pro-
tection  organisations,  academics,  religious  groups, 
industries,  and  NGOs.  All  these  voices  needed  to  be 
heard by the EGE in order to have a proper reflection 
on the complexity of the issues surrounding the debate 
on ethics of synthetic biology.

In its Opinion, the EGE will address a number of issues, 
such  as,  inter  alia:  safety  and  risks,  access  to  the  new 
technology, global justice and influence, dual uses, the 
social and structural effects, and the comodification of 
nature  and  life  forms,  bio-security,  patenting,  open 
access, dual use and public involvement.

On  behalf  of  the  EGE,  I  warmly  thank  you  all  for  your 
participation.

Hugh WHITTALL

Director of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics

Hugh Whittall has been Director of the Nuffield Council 
on Bioethics since February 2007.  The Council’s role is to 
identify ethical questions raised by new developments 
in biological and medical research that are of public con-
cern; to promote discussion; publish reports and make 
policy recommendations.

Hugh graduated from the University of Warwick in 1983 
with  a  degree  in  Philosophy  and  Politics.    After  a  few 
years working in local Government, in housing and edu-
cation, he joined the Department of Health and worked 
initially on new child care legislation.

In  1990  he  helped  set  up  the  Human  Fertilisation  and 
Embryology  Authority,  where  he  stayed,  as  Deputy 
Chief  Executive,  until  1996,  responsible  for  licensing, 
policy and communications.  He then spent three years 
on  secondment  to  the  European  Commission  in  Brus-
sels, where he was responsible for the funding and pro-
motion of multidisciplinary research in bioethics within 
the  Biomedicine  and  Health  research  programme.  He 
returned to the HFEA in September 1999.

In  January  2002,  Hugh  rejoined  the  Department  of 
Health, where he was involved with the preparation and 
passage of the Human Tissue Act 2004, and the setting 
up of the Human Tissue Authority.  He was also responsi-
ble for transplantation policy, having initiated the Organ 
Donation Task Force whose role was to advise Ministers 
on how to improve organ donation rates.

In February 2007, Hugh became Director of the Nuffield 
Council on Bioethics, which has since published reports 
on  ethical  issues  in  the  Forensic  Use  of  Bioinformation 
and Public Health.  The Council is currently working on 
reports  on  dementia  and  personalised  healthcare,  and 
it is shortly to begin work on a project on donation and 
volunteering in the clinical context.

Hugh  is  married  to  Annabel,  an  artist,  with  whom  he 
has three children.  They spend most of their holidays in 
France.  He plays guitar rather badly, and will continue 
playing soccer for as long as his knees can stand it.

The Ethics of  
Synthetic Biology

Hugh WHITTALL

Introduction

Although there is no agreed definition for synthetic bio-
logy (SynBio), it can be understood broadly as the con-
struction  of  novel  biological  networks/organisms  with 
bespoke properties, using standardised biological parts 
that code for known functions.

Standardised biological parts can include DNA sequenc-
es artificially designed and chemically synthesised in the 
lab, or genetic material from existing organisms.  SynBio 
can involve the redesign of existing systems or the de-
sign of entirely novel networks. The workforce is multi-
disciplinary and includes biologists, engineers, chemists 
and IT specialists.

Within SynBio, three main areas of research are emerging:

•	

•	

•	

Creation	of	minimal	genomes	–	this	determines	the	
smallest number of genes required for a bacterium 
to  survive  so  that  other  DNA  building  blocks  and 
synthetic  pathways  can  be  added  to  create  micro-
organisms with a specific function.

Production	of	artificial	cells	–	this	aims	to	construct	
wholly artificial cells. For example, a protocell is be-
ing developed currently which uses peptide nucleic

Standardising	parts	 and	 pathway	 engineering;	 and	
expanding the gene pool – the aim is to standardise 
genetic components with specific functions so that 
these can be connected to form a genetic pathway 
with a certain function. A registry of such parts, so-
called “BioBricks”, has been developed by MIT.

whereas  current  detection  relies  on  the  infection 
progressing and infecting the patient.

In	 biopharmaceutical	 production,	 scientists	 have	
developed  bacteria  which  produce  the  precursor 
to artemisinin, the anti-malarial drug. Currently, ar-
temisinin  is  extracted  from  wormwood  but  this  is 
associated with high costs on account of difficulties 
in cultivating the plant. Scientists hope that the use 
of SynBio in artemisinin production will reduce the 
costs.

It	is	thought	that	SynBio	could	lead	to	the	develop-
ment  of  a  sustainable  chemical  industry:  bacteria 
have been engineered which produce spider silk, a 
material with significant industrial potential because 
of its strength and elasticity.

Finally,	 SynBio	 is	 providing	 new	 means	 of	 energy	
production.  Microorganisms  have  been  developed 
which produce fatty acids that are optimal for bio-
diesel, and given increasing pressures to develop re-
newable and sustainable fuels, such developments 
could be highly significant.

The potential benefits of SynBio are great. However, Syn-
Bio gives rise to a number of concerns and wider ethical 
questions  which  are  the  focus  of  the  remainder  of  this 
talk.

Biosafety

The production of synthetic microorganisms raises con-
cerns regarding biosafety.

Applications have been envisaged which could provide 
benefits for society in several different areas. However, it 
should be noted that many of these are still aspirations, 
and there is a concern that future applications of SynBio 
may be over-hyped.

•	

Some  applications  have  nevertheless  been  developed 
and  these  are  now  the  focus  of  commercial  develop-
ment. For example:

First,	are	existing	risk	assessment	policies	capable	of	
dealing with SynBio? Unknown risks to the environ-
ment  and  public  health  are  posed  by  unexpected 
interactions  by  the  synthetic  microorganisms.  E.g. 
Microorganisms  released 
into  the  environment 
could transfer their genes to other microorganisms 
by the process, horizontal gene transfer. Can we cur-
rently assess these “unknown unknowns” and make 
adequate provision to reduce these risks?

•	

In	 biomedicine,	 a	 biosensor	 to	 detect	 early-stage	
urinary catheter infection has been developed. This 
allows  doctors  to  detect  the  infection  in  3  hours, 

•	 Also,	 current	 risk	 assessment	 policies	 were	 devel-
oped  to  assess  GM  organisms  –  these  compare 
the altered organism with the natural organism on 

26

which  it  is  based,  considering  the  individual  trait 
introduced. SynBio may involve multiple traits from 
several different donor organisms, and therefore be 
markedly more complex to assess.

rorism could be practised by lone individuals, who effec-
tively engage in SynBio in their garages or homes.  How 
might governance deal with lone operators, as opposed 
to whole organisations? 

•	 Other	concerns	centre	on	the	SynBio	workforce.	The	
SynBio workforce is young and includes a significant 
number  of  non-biologists.  Such  individuals  may 
have  limited  or  no  knowledge  of  biosafety  or  past 
biosafety  fears,  which  raises  concerns  about  how 
bio safety may be implemented.

Biosecurity

There  are  concerns  that  SynBio  could  be  used  to  pro-
duce  bioweapons,  raising  concerns  about  biosecurity. 
High-profile  developments  have  fuelled  such  worries.  
In 2002, scientists synthesised the previously eradicated 
polio virus. Then in 2005, scientists announced that they 
had  synthesised  the  1918  Spanish  flu  virus,  which  had 
caused  a  pandemic  killing  an  estimated  20–50  million 
people.

There  are  concerns  also  that  the  current  environment 
could enable and even promote bioterrorism. A number 
of factors could contribute to this:

•	

It	 is	 thought	 that	 known	 pathogens	 could	 be	 pro-
duced in a lab and effectively concealed from bio-
security governance.

•	 Access	to	DNA	sequences	may	be	too	easy.	In	2006,	
a UK journalist demonstrated a lack of DNA supply 
regulation by ordering sequences of the small pox 
virus, and having them delivered to his house.

Another question is whether publishing the sequences 
of  viruses  and  information  on  how  they  were  synthe-
sised  could  provide  information  to  bioterrorists  to  en-
gineer  their  own  pathogenic  organisms.  Necessary 
equipment  such  as  DNA  synthesisers  are  readily  avail-
able on second-hand auction sites like eBay. A low level 
of biosecurity awareness was found amongst European 
synthetic  biologists,  and  this  could  be  detrimental  to 
implementing governance.

Given this environment, there is also concern that there 
will be the rise of ‘garage biology’, where SynBio bioter-

However,  there  is  some  debate  as  to  how  real  the  risk 
of  SynBio  being  used  to  develop  bioweapons  is.  Great 
difficulties  exist  in  both  producing  existing  and  novel 
pathogens, and developing these into weapons.

The  focus  of  biosecurity  has  also  been  questioned: 
Should  we  concentrate  our  attention  on  bioterrorism 
by rogue groups and lone operators or state-sponsored 
biowarfare?  To-date, there has been a limited number of 
bioterrorism attacks with non-modified pathogens, and 
some commentators have asserted that focus should be 
on state-sponsored military use of SynBio. This also raises 
the question about dual-use research and the legitimacy 
of state-sponsored development of biowarfare.

Intellectual property

SynBio raises intellectual property issues. Currently, Syn-
Bio consists of both patents and open-source systems.

•	

The	 J.	 Craig	 Venter	 Institute	 has	 applied	 to	 patent	
Mycoplasma laboratorium – the sequence they claim 
represents the minimal requirements for life. It has 
also  applied  for  broader  patents  to  cover  creation 
of synthetic genomes and their transplantation into 
cells.

•	 Meanwhile,	 MIT	 has	 developed	 an	 open-source	

Registry of Standard Biological Parts.

With  patenting,  there  are  concerns  that  overly  broad 
patents  could  limit  competition,  whereas  narrow  pat-
ents  could  increase  the  complexity  when  doing  re-
search.  The morality of patents on living organisms has 
also been questioned. With MIT’s open-source registry, 
there have been questions of ownership as some parts 
have already been patented.

There  is  also  a  cultural  difference  with  regards  to  IP.  In 
the USA, there has historically been a wider acceptance 
of patents, whereas in Europe there has been a feeling of 
distaste towards patenting. This cultural difference could 
become more significant as SynBio develops globally.

27

Trade and global justice

There  are  concerns  that  SynBio  could  widen  the  gap 
between rich and poor countries.  Such thoughts have 
been  prompted  by  the  use  of  SynBio  to  produce  the 
precursor  for  the  anti-malarial  drug,  artemisinin.    This 
work has now received a grant from the Bill and Melinda 
Gates  Foundation  to  further  develop  the  technology.  
Artemisinin is extracted from wormwood which is cul-
tivated  in  China,  Southeast  Asia  and  Africa,  and  critics 
of  SynBio  contend  that  SynBio-produced  artemisinin 
would  neither  stimulate  nor  sustain  local  artemisinin 
production,  effectively  shifting  development  from  the 
developing world to the developed. In addition, devel-
oping nations may be forced to buy such products from 
the one company.

Other factors may also prohibit developing nations from 
engaging  with  SynBio.  For  example,  developing  coun-
tries  may  lack  the  knowledge  base,  or  money  to  buy 
access to patented parts. Governance may also restrict 
their access.

Human intervention in nature

SynBio, as with any human intervention in nature, raises 
concerns over the ‘naturalness’ of the intervention and 
‘creating life’.  In 1999, a group of bioethicists, convened 
by	Craig	Venter,	considered	the	goal	of	creating	a	mini-
mal genome organism. They found that the prospect of 
such  work  did  not  violate  any  fundamental  moral  pre-
cepts or boundaries.  However, they said that the work 
raised questions that ought to be considered before fur-
ther  advances  were  made.    These  included:  How  does 
work on minimal genomes and the creation of new free-
living organisms change how we frame ideas of life and 
our relationship to it?

The precautionary principle

SynBio also raises wider ethical questions. The concerns 
associated  with  SynBio  are  similar  to  those  raised  by 
GM  and  another  emerging  technology,  nanotechnol-
ogy.  These  sciences  raise  the  same  question  –  when 
un certainties  are  so  profound,  how  can  we  assess  risk 
meaningfully?    How  do  we  employ  the  precautionary 
principle? Also, what constitutes the public’s reaction to 

these  sciences/technologies?  What  is  the  “yuck  factor” 
and what role should it play in policy discussions?

Public engagement

Questions arise as to how public engagement with Syn-
Bio  can  be  effective.    A  national  survey  in  the  USA  on 
awareness  and  attitudes  towards  nanotechnology  and 
SynBio  found  that  approximately  two-thirds  of  adults 
polled  had  heard  nothing  about  SynBio,  and  yet  two-
thirds  were  willing  to  express  an  initial  opinion  on  the 
potential benefits vs. risks. 

It has also been suggested that the public may only ap-
preciate applications of SynBio, such as ways of tackling 
a disease, rather than the methods used. There have also 
been  calls  for  scientists  to  temper  “hyperbolic”  expec-
tations  so  as  to  avoid  public  disappointment.  It  would 
appear that they are faced by a dilemma of communica-
tion,  in  which  they  must  emphasise  the  potential  ben-
efits of SynBio to fellow scientists to secure funding, and 
yet  down-play  these  to  the  public  so  as  not  to  create 
seemingly false expectations.

Governance

Finally, there are questions regarding the governance of 
SynBio.

•	

Is	 current	 governance	 sufficient?	 	 Current	 govern-
ance  includes  national  and  international  systems 
which, although not specifically dedicated to SynBio, 
together  provide  a  “patchwork”  regulatory  frame-
work. However, there have been concerns over the 
adequacy  of  this  fragmented  framework  and  spe-
cific governance is emerging.

•	 Who	should	regulate?		Scientists	have	made	propos-
als for self-regulation but these have been dismissed 
by civil society organisations. Self-regulation has not 
been ruled out but cited as a possibility amongst a 
range of options, including external regulation.

•	 What	should	be	the	governing	principles?		The	role	
of  the  precautionary  and  proactionary  principles 
has  been  questioned.  Both  hold  good  objectives 
but entail different consequences for the progress of 

28

 
SynBio. The precautionary principle advocates that 
new  substances  should  be  considered  dangerous 
until proven safe, whereas the proactionary princi-
ple  asserts  that  science  and  technology  should  be 
considered safe unless and until proven otherwise.

•	

•	

There	 are	 questions	 about	 whether	 governance	
should be decided regionally, at the level of the state 
or internationally. The need for harmonious regula-
tion has been highlighted by commentators who as-
sert that regulation could lead to production being 
driven abroad where regulation is less stringent.

Finally,	where	is	governance	needed?	For	example,	
is  governance  required  for  state-sponsored  bio-
warfare as well as to prohibit bioterrorism?

Public Perception and 
the Media: the Case of 
Synthetic Biology

Eleonore PAUWELS

How  is  public  perception  of  synthetic  biology  likely  to 
evolve? What factors will have an impact on framing this 
emerging  technology,  its  benefits  and  risks?  How  the 
public learns about synthetic biology, from whom, and 
with  what  message  could  have  a  far-reaching  impact. 
If synthetic biology is to deliver on its promise, the sci-
entific  community  cannot  leave  public  engagement  to 
chance  or  assume  that  the  press  will  accurately  repre-
sent the science and related implications.

My contribution will first highlight the main trends and 
the emerging areas of convergence and divergence be-
tween  the  coverage  of  synthetic  biology  in  prominent 
American  and  European  printed  media.  Then,  drawing 
on  the  results  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  research 
conducted  on  public  perception  of  synthetic  biology 
in the United States, I will explore how members of the 
public react to balanced information about the science, 
its benefits and risks. Finally, on the basis of this analysis 
of press coverage and public perception of synthetic 
biology, I will identify some of the societal concerns that 
might persist as research develops.

Synthetic Biology in the American and European 
Press

The  field  of  synthetic  biology  is  rapidly  growing  and 
evolving as it establishes itself in the scientific commu-
nity. Consequently, the emergence of synthetic biology 
has been increasingly reported in the press in different 
countries. At this early stage, it is noteworthy that the 
coverage  of  synthetic  biology  varies  from  country  to 
country,  with  some  emphasising  potential  risks  and 
benefits, others focusing on future applications and yet 
others examining the social and ethical concerns that 
might arise as the technology is developed.

A recent study1, conducted as part of the synthetic bi-
ology  project  at  the  Wilson  Center,  comparing  press 

coverage  in  the  United  States  and  in  Europe  since 
2003 found that the American press has painted a far 
rosier picture of synthetic biology. Half of the Ameri-
can press articles surveyed mentioned the benefits of 
the science while saying nothing about possible risks 
and downsides, as opposed to only 28 percent for the 
European press.

In addition, discussions in the US media about possible 
risks have been one-dimensional, focusing primarily on 
biosecurity  and  not  mentioning  biosafety  or  ethical  is-
sues. This imbalance sows the seeds for diverging public 
concerns  and  governance  strategies  that  can  have  an 
adverse impact on commercialisation and global trade. 
This  happened  with  agricultural  biotechnology  and  is 
now being repeated with nanotechnology.

More importantly, the analyses of the American and Eu-
ropean press reveal a distinct difference in the way the 
potential risks of synthetic biology are presented to the 
American and European public. The current focus of the 
American press on biosecurity issues and of the Europe-
an press on biosafety and environmental impact could 
lead to diverging opinions about the risks and potential 
regulation of this field.

Why  should  we  –  as  scientists,  ethicists  or  sociologists 
– care about how synthetic biology is being introduced 
into public discourse and the popular press? In the short 
term, public awareness and understanding of synthetic 
biology will be influenced by press coverage of the field. 
The way synthetic biology is portrayed in the press of-
fers  insights  into  how  both  supporters  and  opponents 
wish to frame the issues raised by its development. But 
this is also why media analysis should be backed up by 
quantitative  and  qualitative  contextual  studies  to  ex-
plore public perception of synthetic biology.

Public Perception of Synthetic Biology in the  
United States

How much do Americans know about synthetic biology? 
Do members of the public think potential benefits of this 
emerging technology will outweigh potential risks?

These questions were part of a representative national 
telephone survey of 1 003 US adults conducted by Pe-
ter D. Hart Research Associates in August 2008 on be-
half  of  the  project  on  emerging  nanotechnologies  at 
the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars2.
This poll was the first time Americans had been asked 
about synthetic biology in a telephone survey and pro-
duced two clear findings: first, that most people know 
little  or  nothing  about  synthetic  biology  and,  second, 
notwithstanding  this  lack  of  knowledge,  respondents 
are likely to venture some remark about what they think 
synthetic biology is and the trade-off between poten-
tial benefits and risks.

The results of two focus groups organised, at the request 
of  the  Wilson  Center,  in  Baltimore  (Maryland)  on  6  Au-
gust 2008 among adults aged between 18 and 65 – one 
among women, the other among men – confirm these 
two  preliminary  findings  and  yield  additional  insights 
into  how  members  of  the  public  react  to  balanced  in-
formation about the benefits and risks of synthetic biol-
ogy. These first-ever focus groups on synthetic biology 
showed  high  levels  of  concern  about  applications  and 
questions about oversight. None of this should come as 
a surprise, since there is a long history of public concern 
about  different  forms  of  biotechnology,  ranging  from 
stem cell research to cloning, genetically modified foods 
and recombinant DNA.

biology is also shaped by cultural values and levels of re-
ligiosity. Comparison of participants’ uninformed and in-
formed perceptions about synthetic biology reveals that 
how much participants knew about this technology bore 
little relation to their framing of its risks and benefits. In 
fact, providing the participants in the focus group with 
balanced  information  about  synthetic  biology  did  not 
simply lead to more or less support for the technology 
but to a more nuanced level of discussion, which shows 
the participants’ relative ambivalence towards the ‘play-
ing God’ aspects of the technology. 

The field of application seems to be another decisive fac-
tor in the framing of synthetic biology. One key finding 
was that participants in both focus groups were far more 
easily  engaged  in  constructive  discussions  on  energy 
than  on  health  applications.  In  both  focus  groups,  the 
top-ranked  application  of  synthetic  biology  was  creat-
ing new, cheaper and cleaner sources of energy.

Finally, acceptance of the risk-benefit trade-off for syn-
thetic biology seems to depend on having a supervisory 
structure  capable  of  managing  the  unknowns,  human 
and environmental concerns and long-term effects.

Societal Concerns about Synthetic Biology in Europe 
and in the United States

The  objective  of  this  section  is  not  to  draw  exhaustive 
conclusions  about  the  societal  concerns  raised  by  syn-
thetic biology, but rather to provide readers with a qual-
itative  insight  into  which  aspects  of  synthetic  biology 
might be welcomed by the public and which concerns 
could lead to potential public uneasiness.

Finding only some support for the ‘familiarity argument’ 
– i.e. that support for emerging technologies is likely to 
increase as awareness of them develops – these two fo-
cus groups suggest that the process of framing synthetic

ing  ethics  are  largely  based  on  micro-ethics  emphasis-
ing the responsibility of the individual practitioner. This 
system is ill-equipped to deal with broad assessments of 
the impact of the engineering community and its collec-
tive practices on social or biological systems. In addition, 
many engineers have little training in biology, toxicology 
and environmental sciences – all of which are crucial for 
impact assessments of new biological organisms.

In addition, by ‘engineering life’ synthetic biology could 
have  an  unprecedented  impact  on  the  contemporary 
dynamics of relationships between humans and nature, 
especially on the beliefs and ideas that shape how peo-
ple understand and value nature and assign it meaning 
in their lives.

including  the  problematic  sustainable  development. 
However,  voices  are  emerging  amidst  civil  society  to 
contest this: ‘Fearing that ‘frankencells’ will threaten the 
ecosystem, environmental groups such as Greenpeace 
and  Friends  of  the  Earth  have  labelled  synthetic  biol-
ogy ‘genetic engineering on steroids’ and condemned 
it as ‘a grave biosafety threat to people and the planet4.’ 
Some  activists  have  already  called  for  a  complete  re-
search  moratorium5.  To  date,  there  is  no  solid  reason 
to deny or question that synthetic biology could offer 
an  unprecedented  opportunity  to  transform  modern 
medicine,  generate  clean  biofuels  and  create  millions 
of green jobs, but also it is not impossible that the tech-
nology could develop in an unsustainable way – with 
regard to environmental and societal concerns. 

Synthetic Biology as the New Technological Fix?
Synthetic  biology  is  increasingly  presented  by  the  sci-
entific  community  as  a  key  solution  –  a  ‘technological 
fix’  –  to  the  challenges  of  sustainable  development  by 
‘greening’  chemical  and  engineering  sciences.  As  re-
cently  mentioned  in  the  San  Jose  Mercury  News,  ‘Just 
as  the  first  wave  of  biotechnology  revolutionised  agri-
culture  and  medicine,  scientists  today  herald  synthetic 
biology as a second wave of innovation capable of solv-
ing society’s most pressing challenges. In the laboratory, 
researchers are developing customised organisms with 
powerful new capabilities. These modified cells can be 
programmed to fight diseases, create new wonder ma-
terials for manufacturing or produce an abundant source 
of clean, renewable energy3.’

In  the  scientific  community,  synthetic  biology  is  cast 
unambiguously as the solution to a range of social ills, 

To conclude, synthetic biology is evolving in the shadow 
of  public  consciousness  –  a  situation  that  might  serve 
the short-term interests of the research community, but 
not the long-term interests of society. Based on quanti-
tative and qualitative studies commissioned by the Wil-
son Center, it is unlikely that more than a few percent of 
the public have even heard the term synthetic biology. 
This  lack  of  public  awareness  and  engagement  set  the 
stage  for  what  some  have  termed  the  ‘surprise  of  Dol-
ly’  problem  (referring  to  the  appearance  of  the  cloned 
sheep, Dolly, in 1997). ‘Without prior discussion of ethical 
issues, the general public cannot develop a framework 
or  common  language  to  discuss  acceptable  uses  of  a 
new biomedical technology, or even whether it should 
be used at all6.’ A public backlash against synthetic bio-
logy is a real possibility and could compromise the de-
velopment of valuable applications, resulting in loss of 
the economic and social benefits.

of Synthetic Biology

Researcher at the Rathenau Institute

Bart Walhout is a researcher in the Technology Assess-
ment Division of the Rathenau Institute. His background 
is in electronics design. Bart studied technology and so-
ciety at Eindhoven University of Technology, where his 
graduation  project  studied  government  policy  in  rela-

tion  to  the  social  controversies  sparked  by  biotechnol-
ogy. At the Rathenau Institute he is working on projects 
dealing with nanotechnology and its convergence with 
biotechnology,  information  technology  and  the  cogni-

Is This (the Good) Life?
Engaging the World of 
Synthetic Biology

Bart Walhout

In 2007 the work of Paul Rothemund, a US synthetic bi-
ologist,  was  exhibited  in  Design  and  the  Elastic  Mind  at 
the  Museum  of  Modern  Art  in  New  York.  Rothemund 
made smileys out of synthetic DNA and pictured these 
with an electron microscope. Is that art? Is it science? It 
is both, but indeed you do need an elastic mind to grasp 
the  meaning  of  smiling  faces  made  from  the  material 
which many consider to be the code of life. Hence the 
title of my presentation. The ambitions of synthetic bi-
ology challenge basic ideas about what is life and how 
science and technology can sustain the good life. 

Whatever the good life may be, we all have our prefer-
ences.  Speaking  for  myself,  I  am  educated  as  an  engi-
neer.  And,  yes,  I  do  like  the  engineering  approach  to 
synthetic  biology.  Getting  things  to  work!  However, 
although  I  am  not  that  old,  as  you  see  I  have  already 
ended up as a hopelessly romantic Christian white male, 
forever reflecting on the meaning of life in our techno-
logical culture. Fortunately, the EGE saved me from my 
eternal deliberations, and so did the Rathenau Institute 
I am working for. We need biofuels and new medicine. 
Synthetic  biology  promises  new  applications  in  those 
areas. So there is work to be done. Let’s see if we, social 
engineers, can contribute to good governance of appli-
cations of synthetic biology and the implications, which 
certainly can be part of the good democratic life.

I  was  asked  to  present  an  overview  of  applications  of 
synthetic  biology  and  the  societal  implications.  In  short, 
the latter comprise — next to the moral questions about 
what  is  life  and  how  to  treat  it  —  public  issues,  such  as 
biosafety,  biosecurity  and  intellectual  property.  Since 
synthetic  biology  has  caught  the  attention  of  public  in-
stitutes, such as the Rathenau Institute in 2006, no other 
types of issues have been added, nor have distinctive new 
fields of application been identified. However, the debate 
about  synthetic  biology  has  broadened  to  other  organi-
sations — such as the EGE. And research groups and also 
the European Commission have drafted initial roadmaps. 

We are thus moving from an agenda-setting phase to in-
stitutionalisation and that is highly important in evaluat-
ing the ethical dimensions of the emergence of synthetic 
biology. In order to address the question ‘what has to be 
done?’ (the engaging part), we should not limit ourselves 
to identification of ‘what the applications and implications 
are’, but should also ask ‘where is it going to?’.

First,  I  want  to  look  at  three  levels  when  answering  the 
questions ‘what is it?’ and ‘where is it going to?’. Then I will 
argue that we need to take into account all these three lev-
els in a governance strategy. Finally, I will pick out a few 
challenging issues to be addressed in that way. 

Starting with the formal definitions of what synthetic biol-
ogy is, we see an emphasis on ‘engineering’ and ‘design’. 
This directly invokes expectations about the capabilities of 
synthetic biology: manipulating life as we can manipulate 
machines (Endy), which quite logically can lead to the idea 
of biotechnology as a ‘garage technology’ (Dyson). But ex-
actly these capabilities within our current economic order 
raise  fears  about  new  elite  technologies  (ETC).  Ironically, 
that can be the consequence of synthetic biology, as Drew 
Endy puts it, ‘making biology easier to engineer’. 

Getting  more  down  to  earth,  we  can  identify  two  ap-
proaches at the conceptual level of synthetic biology re-
search:  deconstructing  (top-down,  for  example  sponge 
research, cf. Dan Morse) and constructing (bottom-up, for 
example biobricks, cf. MIT)1. But both approaches aim at 
finding essential structures in order to (re)construct from 
an engineering rationale. Synthetic biology might vanish 
as a research field due to unfulfilled expectations, but the 
engineering rationale will stay and will strongly influence 
the future of biotechnology (cf. the transition from tissue 
engineering to regenerative medicine).

It is important to understand that these paradigm chang-
es  are  not  just  caused  by  new  ideas,  but  are  also  made 
possible  by  technological  progress  bringing  old  ideas 

(1)  Sometimes also called in vivo vs in vitro; see, for example, the report of the Dutch Royal Academy of Science and the Dutch Health Council 

(Creating Opportunities, 2008).

within reach. And this enabling is not a neutral factor: a 
short history of biotechnology shows how ICT is not just 
a tool, but is also used as a concept (e.g. DNA as informa-
tion or cells as information processing units). Now nano-
technology  not  only  allows  synthetic  construction,  but 
also leads scientists to see cells as nanomachines.

Third,  there  are  lists  of  possible  fields  of  application: 
industrial  chemistry,  energy  and  medicine.  Dutch  bot-
tom-up  examples  include  molecular  motors  made  of 
enzymes  and  carbon  nanotubes  (University  of  Delft), 
biosensors (Philips) and self-assembling structures using 
DNA.  Still  these  fields  of  application  are  defined  by  re-
search programmes which first reflect the development 
of  synthetic  biology  as  a  platform  technology  (as  illus-
trated by the Synberc research programme). 

As we can also see from the European TESSY roadmap, 
these  programmes  recognise  the  importance  of  good 
governance  and  incorporate  it  into  the  system  think-
ing  (social  engineering?).  At  this  level  we  also  find  the 
typical  list  of  societal  issues:  biosafety,  biosecurity  and 
intellectual property. One important point to note is that 
normative assumptions about what is life do play a role 
in  these  issues.  And  although  these  are  old  questions, 
synthetic biology adds new dimensions and brings new 
life into the biodebate. 

Now, having seen three levels of ‘what it is’ and ‘where 
it is going to’, what has to be done? The first point is that 
the order of the issues differs. For example, biosafety is-
sues call for action: analysing new challenges, discussing 
regulatory approaches and implementing them on time. 
Biotech and nanotech developments show that this takes 
a considerable amount of time and therefore should not 
be postponed until real applications are there (although, 
of course, tension is created when it comes to regulating 
applications  still  under  development).  Discussing  the 
benefits  and  downsides  of  intellectual  property  is  on 
quite another level. Here we are entering a fundamental 
debate  on  the  economic  order  and  knowledge-based 
innovation.  So  different  issues  are  discussed  in  differ-
ent arenas and therefore call for different approaches to 
governance.

Second,  biotechnology  and  nanotechnology  are  also  re-
cent  examples  of  emerging  technologies  that  do  call  for 
broadening debate and decision-making (an important as-
pect of governance, although it still feels like experiment-
ing).  To  use  a  catch  phrase,  ‘act  and  connect’.  However, 
these two sets of activities can be inextricably intertwined. 
Moreover, societal issues are framed differently by different 
groups of stakeholders. In a recent paper we explored how 
civil society organisations (CSOs) perceive the emergence 
of synthetic b iology. Our research shows that CSOs tend to 
put much more emphasis on the socio-economic dimen-
sions,  whereas  technology  assessment  organisations  and 
research councils pay great attention to the moral/cultural 
level. And these differences can change over time.

The point that I want to make is that the way engagement 
can be broadened depends on the way developments and 
issues are framed. And that is why I stated that all three 
levels of framing ‘what it is’ and ‘where it is going to’ have 
to be taken into account for a governance strategy. Next 
this governance strategy has to be continuously assessed 
in the light of the debate so far.

Finally,  I  want  to  highlight  three  challenges:  (1)  acting 
now: putting it in a framework, while (2) also reflecting 
on  frameworks  as  playing  a  fundamental  role  (3)  chal-
lenged by symbolic boundary shifts. That is multi-order 
learning! First, the risk issue. A number of reports have 
been  released  by  now  and  I  think  it  is  possible  for  the 
EGE  to  draw  conclusions  from  comparison  of  these  re-
ports for its opinion on synthetic biology. I must stress 
the	 importance	 of	 pace	 (the	 example	 of	 Craig	 Venter	
shows  speed  and  proposes  self-regulation,  while  the 
genome  of  the  Spanish  influenza  virus  has  been  re-
constructed).  Second,  the  discussion  about  intellectual 
property touches on assumptions about our knowledge 
economy  (for  example,  the  knowledge-patent-power 
relation).  Third,  the  contribution  which  synthetic  biol-
ogy  makes  to  influencing  trends  and  symbolic  bound-
ary shifts, which refer to the good life: (1) the bio-based 
economy,  taking  nature  as  a  starting  point  for  human 
progress, instead of seeing nature as the vulnerable bor-
der and (2) enhancement, i.e. ‘designing and construct-
ing life’ understood by thinking about the human condi-
tion (for example, Dolly --> Synthia)?

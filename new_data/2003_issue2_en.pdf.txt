The first issue of the Newsletter published
in February 2003 has been well received
by many readers and your comments and
suggestions  encouraged  us.    The
European Group on Ethics has taken the
initiative to publish this Newsletter in order
to facilitate a closer collaboration with and
between National Ethics Committees. 

The Newsletter can become a tool for this
purpose in the sense that firstly it may be
a way of identifying who is working on
what problems, and secondly it may help
to initiate contacts among those who are
working in the same area, or in related
areas. 

Within a few months, on 1st May 2004, ten
new countries will join the EU.  The need
to  facilitate  contacts  and  exchanges  is
therefore greater than ever.

In  this  second  issue,  we  welcome
contributions  from  EU  or  future  EU
Member States as well as non European
countries  and  other 
international
organisations involved in bioethics like the
Council of Europe.  We hope that this
second issue of “Ethically Speaking” will
induce  numerous  and  fruitful  contacts
between all these contributors.

THE EUROPEAN GROUP ON ETHICS IN
SCIENCE AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES
(EGE)

The  European  Group  on  Ethics  in  Science  and
New  Technologies  (EGE)  is  an  independent,
pluralist and multidisciplinary body, which advises
the European Commission on the ethical aspects of
science  and  new  technologies  with  respect  to  the
preparation  and  implementation  of  Community
legislation  and  policies.  It  can  do  so  either  at  the
request of the Commission or on its own initiative.
The  European  Parliament  and  the  Council  may
draw  the  Commission's  attention  to  questions
which they consider of major ethical importance.

Opinion published in 2003

(cid:1)  Opinion n° 18 : 

Ethical aspects of genetic testing in the workplace
(28/07/2003)
In  its  advisory  Opinion  no.  18  published  on  28th
July  2003,  the  EGE  addressed  itself  to  ethical
questions  arising  from  genetic  tests,  including
‘genetic  screening’  (that  is,  the  use  of  a  scientific
test  to  determine  whether  a  person  possesses
particular  variant  forms  of  one  or  more  genes  in
his/her  genome)  as  well  as  ‘genetic  monitoring’
(meaning  the  examination,  at  regular  intervals,  for
chromosomal  abnormalities  in  samples  of  cells
from  a  person  who  may  be  at  risk,  in  their
employment,  of  exposure  to  agents  which  cause
genetic damage). 

The  ethical  issues  can  concern  the  carrying  out  of
the genetic test itself, in particular with respect to:
(cid:1)  free  and  informed  consent  in  a  context  of
employment  or  recruitment  in  which  the
in  a  position  of
is 
employee/candidate 
weakness relative to the employer;

(cid:1) 

(cid:1) 

the  duty  of  the  employer  with  respect  to  the
safety of the employee and third parties;

the  validity,  the  reliability  and  the  predictive
value of a test on the basis of which decisions
regarding employment would be taken. 

Ethical  issues  also  concern  the  use  of  genetic
information  obtained  by  such  tests,  that  is  the
confidentiality  of  the  data,  the  right  not  to  know,
and  the  risk  of  unfair  discrimination  between
employees or candidates for employment.

In  their  Advisory  Opinion,  the  Group  emphasises
that  the  ethical  dilemmas  and  conflicts  of  interest
regarding  genetic  testing  should  be  viewed  in  the
general  context  of  medical  data  in  the  workplace.
The  Group  insists  that  employers  have  a  duty
during  recruitment  to  guarantee  fair  treatment  for
all  applicants  and  to  avoid  any  discrimination  as
well as to protect the health of their employees and
prevent risk to third parties.

Opinions in preparation

The Group is currently preparing an opinion on the
Ethical aspects of umbilical cord blood banking.
Indeed, the development of private banks as well as
their advertising on the web raises concerns and it
is  at  the  request  of  the  Commission  that  the  EGE
will  submit  this  opinion.  This  opinion  should  be
published in the beginning of 2004.

In parallel, the Group is also looking at the ethical
aspects attached to information and communication
technologies  and  is  as  well  envisaging  to  give  an
opinion  on 
to
nanotechnologies.

EGE Activities in 2003

Traditionally,  every  semester,  the  Group  visits  the
country assuming the Presidency of the EU in order
to  meet  national  instances  and  representatives  of
parliament  or  government  involved  in  the  ethical
debate.

Under the Greek Presidency, on May 26th and 27th
2003, the Group met in Athens the members of the
Greek  Bioethics  Committee  chaired  by  Prof.
the  usual  exchange  of
Koumantos.  Beside 
information  on 
roles  and
functionning, 
the 
mandates  of  both  groups,  the  discussion  went  on
the opinion on the ethical aspects of genetic testing
in  the  workplace,  recently  published  by  the  EGE,
and the question of genetic data and confidentiality.
The Group also met Professor C. Stefanis, Minister
of Health.

Under  the  Italian  Presidency,  from  20th  till  22nd
October 2003, the Group held a working meeting in
Rome  and  met  members  of  the  National  Bioethics
Committee  (NBC)  chaired  by  Prof.  Francesco
D’AGOSTINO.  The  main  theme  of  the  exchange
with  members  of  the  NBC  was  on  genetic  testing
and  other  medical  services  proposed  on 
the
internet.  The  EGE  was  also  received  by  the
President of the Italian Republic, Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi.

health  status  of  the  employees  and  not  their
potential  future  health  status  should  be
considered

Furthermore there is, up until now, no proven
evidence  that  the  existing  genetic  tests  have

employment. This is why the Group considers
that the use of genetic tests in the context of
the  workplace

in the workplace;

-  the  principle  of  non-discrimination  is  not

violated.

The  Advisory  Opinion  also  specifies  that  the
definition  of  exceptional  cases  for  proposing  and
performing  genetic  screening  in  the  workplace
should  be  explicitly  regulated  by  law.  Moreover,
for a specific application, not only the consent of
the person involved, but also the prior assent of
labour  organisation  and  a
an  appropriate 
specific ad hoc authorisation by an independent
committee should be obtained.

In conclusion, the Group concedes that the result of
genetic screening and genetic monitoring practised
in  the  workplace  should  in  no  case  be  divulged
for the purposes of insurance.

The  Group  had  several  meetings  with  Italian
experts.  First, in the context of the on-going work
on  ICT,  the  Group  met  the  organisers  of  the
website  “Storia  e  memoria”.    In  addition,  in  the
context of the opinion in preparation on cord blood
banking,  the  Group  met  Prof.  Salvatore  Mancuso,
Director  of  the  Department  of  Gynecology  at  the
Catholic University in Rome where one of the most
important  umbilical  cord  cell  bank  is  located.
Representatives  of  Parliament  who  presented
projects  of  law  concerning  cord  blood  banks  also
participated to the discussion.

The draft Additional Protocol to the Convention on
Human  Rights  and  Biomedicine,  on  Biomedical
Research  was approved by the Steering Committee
on  Bioethics  (CDBI)  on  20  June  2003.  The  draft
Protocol  has  been  submitted  to  the  Committee  of
Ministers  of  the  Council  of  Europe.  It  is  foreseen
that  they  will  consult  the  Council  of  Europe's
Parliamentary  Assembly  for  an  opinion,  prior  to
proceeding  to  examination  of the draft  Protocol  in
view of its adoption. The draft Protocol will be the
first  international  legally  binding  instrument  to
address  the  whole  field  of  biomedical  research  on

in  Chapter  V 
Convention,  the  Protocol  addresses  issues  such  as
risks  and  benefits,  scientific  quality,  examination
by  an  ethics  committee,  independence  of  ethics
committees,  information  for  research  participants,
consent  to  participation  in  research,  protection  of

PUBLICATION  OF  THE  REPORT  ON  THE
PROTECTION OF THE EMBRYO IN VITRO

The  Report  on  the  protection  of  the  embryo  in
vitro,  elaborated  by  the  Working  Party  on  the
protection of the human embryo and foetus (CDBI-
CO-GT3)  working  under  the  authority  of  the
Steering  Committee  on  Bioethics  (CDBI),  was
made public on 19 June 2003.   

Whilst on many of the issues covered by this report
there  is  a  broad  consensus  at  European  level,  on
other  matters  a  considerable  diversity  of  opinion
exists, which makes it difficult to identify common
approaches at the present time.  In this context, the
elaboration  of  this  Report  on  the  protection  of  the
human embryo in vitro was considered as a useful
step  to  progress  in  the  ethical  discussion  around
these issues.

intend 

Its  purpose  is  to  aid  reflection  on  these  topics,  by
outlining  the  various  existing  European  positions
on  the  subjects  covered  and  the  arguments  on
which  those  positions  are  based,  without  taking  a
stance  on the  issues  raised.  The  Report  provides  a
brief  introduction  to  the  scientific  issues  involved
as an aid to  understanding  of  the  ethical questions
raised,  but  does  not 
to  provide  a
comprehensive  scientific  review  of  the  relevant
topics. 
It  is  organised  in  four  main  sections.  The  first
section addresses issues of principle concerning the
protection  of  the  human  embryo  in  vitro  that  are
relevant to all of the topics discussed in the report.
It is then followed by three sections discussing the
issues  raised  respectively  by  in  vitro  fertilisation,
by  research  on  the  embryo  in  vitro  and  by
preimplantation genetic diagnosis.

7TH  EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF
NATIONAL ETHICS COMMITTEES

The  7th  European  Conference  of  National  Ethics
Committees  will  take  place  at  the  Council  of
Europe,  Strasbourg  on  1-2  December  2003.  The
purpose of the Conference is to allow members  of
National  Ethics  Committees  to  meet  and  discuss
issues of common interest. The main themes of this
Conference  will  be  bioethics  education  and
research  on  stored  human  tissue.  Approaches  to
bioethics  education  for  a  range  of  audiences,  such
as professionals, ethics committee members and the
public  (both  adults  and  schoolchildren)  will  be
presented.  There  will  also  be  a  session  on  clinical
ethics committees, and presentations of some of the
recent  Opinions  produced  by  National  Ethics
Committees.

THE DANISH COUNCIL OF ETHICS

Objectives and tasks of the Council

The  Danish  Council  of  Ethics  was  created  by  law
by Danish parliament and began its work in 1988. 

The  Council  has  two  tasks:  one  is  to  regularly
advise  parliament  and  government,  especially  the
Danish Minister for  Health  and the  Interior  on the
ethical  problems  arising 
the
development  of  new  techniques  and  treatments  in
the  health  field,  the  other  being  to  inform  the
general public and contribute to the debate on  this
development. 

step  with 

in 

This  is  accomplished  by  submitting  reports  and
statements etc. in specified areas and by  mounting
debate  generating  activities  in  the  form  of  e.g.
public  enquiries  and  debate  days,  publishing  of
debate  books,  anthologies,  videos  and  teaching
material,  and  extensive  lecturing  activities.  In
addition  the  Council  gives  a  rundown  of  its
activities every year in an annual report. 

History

reproduction  and 

Ethical  problems  arising  in  areas  such  as  genetic
engineering,  assisted 
fetal
examination,  caused  the  Danish  Minister  for  the
Interior to set up a committee in April 1984 to look
into these questions. At this time an intense media
debate about the rapid  development  in the  field  of
reproductive technologies captivated the public.

In October 1984 the committee submitted its report
"The  Price  of  Progress",  which  suggested  that  a
central ethical council for the health service should
be created by law. 

Legislation

The  bill  was  passed  in  June  1987  by  a  large
majority in the Danish Parliament. The purpose of
the  act  is  to  ensure  that  advice  and  information
from
concerning

the  Minister  has  no
obligation  to  follow  the  recommendations  of  The
Council. 

Composition of the Council

The  Council  consists  of  17  members,  to  be
appointed  by  the  Minister  of  Health  according  to
the  following  rules:  Eight  members  shall  be
appointed  by 
the  Minister  of  Health.  The
appointment shall consider the appointees' publicly
substantiated knowledge of the ethical, cultural and
social  questions  of  importance  to  the  work  of  the
Council.  Nine  members  shall  be  appointed  by  the
parliamentary committee. Said persons must not be
members  of  parliament,  of  a  municipal  council  or
of  a  county  council.  Where  the  committee  cannot
agree  on  an  appointment,  the  majority  of  the
committee shall decide on the appointment. 

The  appointments  made  shall  ensure  equal
representation of men and women in that sense that
there may be only one more of one sex than of the
other.

The members and the chairman are appointed for a

once. 

Themes

The  Council  began  its  work  on  January  1st  1988.
The  "Act  on  the  Establishment  of  an  Ethical
Council"  directs  the  Council  to  partly  submit
reports concerning specific topics fixed by law and
partly  take  up  tasks  on  its  own  initiative.  The
reports  concerning  specific  topics  were  submitted
in the period 1988-1990.

For the Council of Ethics the last  years  have  been
characterized by the work on some of its core areas:
assisted  reproduction  and  genetic  engineering.  In
2002,  a  report  containing  ethical  deliberations
relating  to  sperm  donation  was  published  and  a
statement  submitted  on  the  sorting  of  fertilized
eggs. A hearing was held on genetic testing and 
statements  submitted  on  cloning  and  on 
the
regulation  of  stem  cell  research.  The  Council's
other  initiatives  in  2002  also  included  publication
of  two  reports  on  conditions  for  the  dying  in
Denmark  and  publication  of  the  teaching  material
"The Perfect Person". This material was sent to the
9th and 10th forms in Danish schools, encouraging
them to nominate pupils for the Ethical Forum  for
Young  People,  2003,  at  which  17  young  people
will be  gathering  to  discuss  and  adopt  a stance  on
the question of the biotechnological transformation
of people.

The  Ethical  Forum  for  Young  People  was  held  in
March  2003.  In  September  2003  the  council
published  an  anthology  on  the  patient/doctor  –
relationship. The council is currently working on a
report on Preimplantation Genetical Diagnosis and
on  a  report  dealing  with  the  issue  of  Euthanasia,
which  will  be  followed  by  a  public  debate  in
November at the Danish Parliament.

Secretariat

The Secretariat of the Council has 6 employees,
one executive director, four project leaders and a
senior assistant.

ETHICAL EVALUATION OF
RESEARCH IN FINLAND

The 

studies. 

research 

university 

Science  and  research  play  an  important  role  in
Finnish  society.  Combined,  the  government  and
business  investment  in  research  and  development
represents  over  3.5  per  cent  of  the  gross  national
product,  which  is  among  the  highest  rates  in  the
in
world.  Finns  have  unwavering  confidence 
science  and  research.  According  to  the  Finnish
Science  Barometer  2001,  Finns  trust  scientific
institutions  more  than  the  legal  system  or  the
church. A large  majority  of  Finns  (80  %)  give  the
standard of the sciences and  research  good  overall
marks,  and  most  (59  %)  think  that  the  research
community  operates  responsibly  and  knows  its
social responsibilities. Finns (70 %) think that cases
of  misappropriation  of 
funds  are
exceptional  and  that  they  should  not  brand  the
entire scientific community. This trust is confirmed
by the statistics compiled by the National Advisory
Board on Research Ethics. Although the number of
cases  of  suspected  misconduct  in  science  varies,
there have only been very few confirmed cases.
The  foundation  for  science  and  research  is  laid  in
school, and the inculcation of ethical models begins
during 
primary
responsibility for teaching research ethics rests with
institutes,
universities.  Universities, 
polytechnics  and  other  research  organisations  also
create action models in reacting to cases brought to
their  attention. There  are  several national  advisory
boards which promote research ethics and common

National Advisory Board on Research Ethics

The  National  Advisory  Board  on  Research  Ethics
was  founded  in  1991  to  address  ethical  questions
relating  to  research  and  to  the  advancement  of
research  ethics  in  Finland  (Decree  1347  of  15
November  1991).  The  Advisory  Board,  which  is
appointed by  the Ministry  of  Education for  a term
of  three  years  at  a  time,  meets  eight  times  a  year.
The  Secretary  General  of  the  Board  is  attached  to
the  Federation  of  Finnish  Learned  Societies.  The
Board:
to
1. Makes  proposals  and 
governmental  authorities  on  legislative  and  other
matters concerning research ethics;
2. Acts  as  an  expert  body  working  towards  the
resolution of ethical issues relating to research;

(785/1992,
amendment  333/1998).  It  is  a  forum  representing
different  parties  concerned  and  deals  with  ethical
issues  relating  to  health  care  and  the  rights  and
status  of  patients.  According  to  the  Decree  on  the
Advisory Board on Health Care Ethics (494/1998),
it:
1.  Takes  initiatives  and  issues  statements  and
recommendations  on  ethical  questions  in  health
care and initiates public discussion on ethics;
2.  Acts  as  an  expert  body  in  the  development  of

Ethics Committees of Hospital Districts

According to the Medical Research Act (488/1999),
an  independent  ethics  committee  has  to  pre-
evaluate and give a favourable opinion on a clinical
trial  before  it  can  be  undertaken.  A  research
proposal which was given a negative opinion by an
ethics committee can be sent to the Sub-Committee
on Medical Research Ethics for re-evaluation.
The  ethics  committees  are  appointed  by  hospital
districts  and  registered  by  provincial  state  offices.
The  size,  composition  and  duties  of  ethics
committees are determined in the Medical Research
Act.
Finland  has  21  hospital  districts  and  30  ethics
committees.

Committees on Animal Experimentation

Under  the  Decree  on  Animal  Experimentation
(1076/1985,  amended  in  1996),  all  institutions
conducting  animal  experiments  must  have  a
committee to evaluate research plans which involve
the use of animals in experiments. Each committee
consists  of  a  chairman,  who  is  in  charge  of
experimentation within the institution, a member of
the  animal  care  staff  and  at  least  two  other
members  familiar  with  animal  experimentation.
The main duty of the committee is to scrutinise the
research  proposals  in  terms  of  compliance  to
animal welfare regulations.
The  committee  may  grant  a  licence  to  a  class  2
experiment.  In  the  case  of  the  more  intrusive  and
painful class 1 experiments, it gives its opinion on
the  proposal  and  refers  it  to  the  provincial  state
office,  which  either  approves  or  rejects 
the
proposal.  Both  the  institutional  committee  and  the

Cooperation Group for Laboratory Animal
Sciences

In  2001  the  Ministry  of  Education  appointed  a
cooperation  group  for  laboratory  animal  sciences
for a three year period (2001–2004):
1. To  coordinate  research,  education  and  other
activities in the field;
2. To  promote  laboratory  animal  welfare  and
discussion  on  ethical  considerations  in  laboratory
animal sciences;
3. To  promote  high  educational  standards  at  all
levels  of  animal  care  and  research  and  to  raise
awareness and increase information available to the
general public about laboratory animal sciences.
The  cooperation  group  consists  of  a  chairman,  a
vice-chairman,  and  13  members  from  universities,
research  organisations,  industry  and  governmental
authorities.  The  cooperation  group  also  has  an
information manager, who acts as a secretary to the
group and is responsible for information and public
relations.
Three working groups have been set up within the
cooperation  group.  The  working  group  on
education  and 
training  focuses  on  upgrading
education and training in all job categories involved
with  laboratory  animals.  It  is  also  important  to
harmonise  Finnish  education  with  European
standards.  The  working  group  on  ethics  promotes
discussion  on  the  welfare  of  animals  and  ethical
considerations in animal experiments. The group is
also  developing  guidelines 
to  help  evaluate
research  plans  from  an  ethical  point  of  view.  The

Board for Gene Technology

The  use  of  genetically  modified  organisms  is
regulated by the Act on Gene Technology.  Its aim
is  to  promote  safe  and  ethically  acceptable  use  of
genetically modified organisms and to prevent and
avert  any  harm  the  use  may  inflict  on  human
health,  animals,  property  or  the  environment.  The
competent authority under the Act is the Board for
Gene  Technology,  which  is  subordinate  to  the
Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The Board is
appointed  for  five  years  by  the  government  upon
the  referral  of  the  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs  and
Health.  The  members  represent  the  Ministry  of
Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health,
and the Ministry of the Environment among others.
Ethical expertise is also represented. The Board has
a full-time Secretary General.
The  Board’s  first  term  of  office  began  on  June  1,
1995 when the Act on Gene Technology came into
force,  and  the  second  term  started  in  June  2000.
The  priorities  of  the  Board  include  processing
notifications  concerning  the  use  and  release  of
genetically  modified  organisms  as  defined  by  the
Act  and  the  enforcement  of  the  regulations.  The
Board also issues instructions and regulations on a
case-by-case  basis,  and  takes  care  of  other  tasks
assigned to it in the Act. The Board cooperates with
the  Advisory  Board  for
different  Ministries, 
Biotechnology and governmental expert authorities
and institutions.

NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE
BIOETHICS COMMITTEE FOR
HEALTH AND LIFE SCIENCES
(CCNE) - FRANCE

The  National  Consultative  Ethics  Committee  for
Health  and  Life  Sciences  was  established  by  a
decree  signed  by  the  President  of  the  French
Republic  on  23rd  February  1983.  It  was  the  first
permanent national ethics Committee with official
authority and a general remit. It was enacted in the
bioethics law  of  29th July  1994  and a  decree  was
implemented  in  1997  establishing  the  procedures
governing 
and

composition 

The  Committee's  mission  is  to  ‘give  opinions  on
ethical problems raised by progress in the fields of
biology,  medicine,  and  health,  and  to  publish
recommendations on this subject’.

The  Committee  also  undertakes  to  organise  an
annual  public  conference  with  the  widest  possible
participation, to enable the exchange of views and
criticisms  concerning 
the  work  accomplished
during the year.

The  Committee  is  composed  of  39  members
divided  into  3  colleges :  those  drawn  from  the
main  philosophies  and  religious  faiths  (5),  those
with  competence 
issues  (19)  and
in  ethical 
scientists (15). They are nominated for a period of
4 years which is only renewable once.

The  president  of  the  CCNE,  presently  Professor
Didier  SICARD  is  nominated  by  the  president  of
the Republic for a renewable period of 2 years.
The Committee gathers in two groups: the Plenary
Committee  which  reassembles  the  40  members
once a month, and the Technical Section which is
composed  of  12  members  elected  by  the  Plenary
Committee and also meets on a monthly basis.

Working  Groups,  which  are  open  to  external
experts,  prepare  documents  on  every 
issue
considered.  These  are  then  submitted  to  the
Technical Section and the Plenary Committee.

The  Committee  may  be  called  upon  by  a  certain
number  of  public  authorities,  but  it  also  has  the
power to act on its own intiative.

During  its  20  years  of  existence,  the  Committee
has  produced  79  advisory  opinions  and  reports,
tackling  many  issues  such  as  fertility  treatment,

ABSTRACT
The  Hellenic  National  Bioethics  Commission
recognizes that human reproductive cloning is
at  the  center  of  international  attention  due  to

born.  Considering  the  biological,  legal  and
ethical  parameters  on 
this  matter  has
concluded that:

a)  Given  the  insufficient  knowledge  and  the
corresponding  state-of-the-art  technology,
the use of reproductive cloning on human
beings  constitutes  totally  impermissible

Food  and  Rural  Development;  Environment  and
Local  Government and  the  Food  Safety  Authority
of Ireland. The group published a report in October
2000,  which  recommended  that  a  National  Ethics
Committee  should  be  established  which  would
consider  “ethical issues raised by biotechnology in
an informed, dispassionate and independent way”.

Current Work Programme

The Council currently has three working groups to
address  bioethical  issues  of  substantive  concern.
Each group is chaired by a member of the Council,
appointed  by  the  Council  chairman  and  includes
council  members  as  well  as  external  co-opted.
Working  groups  meet  on  average  once  every  six
weeks  and  will  prepare  reports  for  discussion  and

A working group on Human Biological Material
has  been  established  in  order  to  examine  ethical
issues relating to the collection, use, retention and
disposal of human biological material. The ethical
issues  that  must  be  considered  from  the  point  of
the  view  of  the  researcher,  the  research  evaluator

examined.  Some  of  the  issues  to  be  covered
include 
of
retrospective/archived  material,  biobanks  and
commercialisation  of  human  material.  The  group
will  produce  a  set  of  recommendations  for  those
working  in  this  field  by  December  2003.  An
executive summary of the technical document will
be prepared specifically for the general public.

A working group on Ethics Committees has been
established 
the  existing
practices  of  Ethical  Committees  in  Ireland.  To
date, 
the  working  group  has  compiled  a
comprehensive list of Research Ethics Committees
in  hospitals,  universities  and 
institutes  of
technology in Ireland. Best international practice in
this  area  has  been  fully  assessed.  The  aim  of  the
group  is  to  produce  guidance  on  the  composition,
structure  and  operation  of  Ethics  Committees  in
Ireland.  It  is  hoped  that  these  guidelines  will  be
compiled  in  consultation  with  the  major  research
funding  agencies  in  the  State  and  will  take
cognizance  of 
the  European  Clinical  Trial
Directive 2001/20/EC.

The  Council  seeks  to  identify  and  anticipate
potential ethical questions raised by biological and
medical  research.  The  work  program  is  based  on
proposals by Council members and other interested
bodies. It is open to review on an annual basis. One
of  the  core  missions  of  the  Council  is  to  promote
public  understanding  and  informed  discussion  on
the  bioethical  issues,  which  concern  society  as  a
whole.    To  this  end,  the  Council  is  organising  a
series of debates in the seven national universities
on  bioethical  topics.    The  Council  will  also
inaugurate an annual public lecture on a bioethical
issue.

The National Bioethics Committee was established
by a decree signed by the President of the Council
of Ministers on 28 March 1990 with the following
tasks: 
- to make, if necessary by exercising its faculty to
access  the  required  information  in  the  existing
national  operating  centres,  as  well  as  by  liaising

and  other  international  organizations  operating  in
the sector, an outline summary of the programmes,
objectives 
and
experimentation in the field of the life sciences and
human health; 
-  to  express  opinions  and  suggest  solutions,  also
for  the  purpose  of  preparing  legislative  acts,  to
address  the  ethical  and  legal  problems  that  may
emerge as a result of the progress of research and
the  emergence  of  possible  new  applications  of

over  both 
the  safeguarding  of  human  and
the  production  of

information regarding bioethics. 

The Italian National Bioethics Committee 
approved  an  Advisory  Opinion  on  nicotine
addiction on 21st March 2003.

The conclusions are outlined below:

consists  primarily 

Nicotine addiction, like all other drug addictions, is
combated  principally  by  preventative  measures
and,  when  these  do  not  suffice,  by  measures
intending  to  limit  its  spread  and  harm.  This
difficult,  complex  operation  must  involve  the
whole  of  civil  society  and  in  particular  doctors,
pharmacists and health workers in general. 
Prevention 
in  providing
information  at  all  levels,  which  must  also  be
addressed  to  children.  Besides  being  intrinsically
correct, such prevention must take into account the
characteristics specific to this phenomenon. These
are  principally  the  obstacles  to  a  clear  perception
of  the  real  dimensions  of  the  dangers  of  nicotine
addiction.  This information, which is educational,
must  concern  young  people  in  an  active  manner,
not only because they can influence the attitudes of
adults,  but  also  because  they  are  potential  victims
of nicotine addiction.
Education  must  be  accompanied  by  restrictive
measures  intended  to  limit  the  use  of  tobacco  as
well  as  the  harm  caused  to  smokers  and  to  those
who  are  passively  exposed  to  tobacco  smoke.  On
this  point,  particular  attention  should  be  paid  to
new-borns and to children. It should be emphasised
that the ease with which tobacco can be purchased
constitutes  in  itself  a  factor  liable  to  increase
nicotine addiction. In respect of individual liberty,
it  is  necessary  to  take  measures  of  incentive,  by
means of taxation or otherwise, to limit the use of
tobacco and to enable the prevention of  its sale in
order to discourage its use amongst young people.
The  reduction  of  harms  must  not  only  concern
treatment of the maladies of nicotine addiction, but
it  should  also  relieve  dependence  on  tobacco
liberty  and
insofar  as 
constitutes the largest obstacle in the fight against
nicotine addiction.

in  education  and 

The fact that the measures undertaken by different
governments  with  the  assistance  of  both  national
and  international  organisations  (UN,  WHO,  EU)
have not yielded the expected results must not be a
basis  for  despondency.  In 
industrialised
countries  which  have  been  leading  the  way  in
information  campaigns, 
in
assistance  to  smokers,  smoking-related  diseases,
especially  lung  cancer,  have  been  reduced  (to
which  the  example  of  Finland  testifies).  In  Italy,
the National Health Plan (2001-2003) is preparing
amongst  other  things,  an  institutional  information
campaign  concerning  healthy 
lifestyles.  This
promising initiative must be vigorously pursued, in
particular its prevention of the use of tobacco and
other drugs.
The  problem  of  nicotine  addiction  is  complex
because  of  its  implications,  which  are  not  only
ethical,  social  and  health-related  but  also  have
consequences  for  the  economy  and  employment.
Therefore, tobacco cultivation should be converted
to other forms of agriculture (which would ensure
an  adequate  income  to  those  employed  in  the
sector)  and  such  moves  should  be  realised
alongside  other 
therapeutic  measures  which
address the essence of nicotine addiction.

THE BIOETHICS COMMITTEE 
OF LATVIA

There  are  6  Bioethics  Committees  in  Latvia:  3
addressing  medical  trials,  2  addressing  scientific

lawyers, 

pharmacists, 

The  Committees  consist  of  doctors,  nurses,
scientists, 
religious
representatives  as  well  as  those  representing  the
disabled and the retired. The  Committees  take  the
form  of  an  independent  standing  body  which
serves  a  term  of  4  years,  renewable  for  one  more
term.

Matters  for  consideration  are  referred 
to  a
Committee  in  written  form  and  resolutions  are
adopted  by  a  majority  vote.  The  Committees
release  their  recommendations  and  opinions  in
written form and the fate of minority or divergent
views  is  reflected.  The  Committees  also  organise
events  for  the  general  public,  making  public  their
recommendations  on  TV,  on  the  radio  or  in  the
press.

The Committees are convened by a Chairman once
a month and if necessary more often. The members
of  the  Committee  in  question  will  elect  a  Vice-
Chairman  who  will  assume  the  authority  of  the
Chairman 
in  his/her  absence.  The  Chairman
presents  cases  verbally  and  is  legally  competent
when the Chairman or Vice-Chairman and half  of
the members of the Committee are present. During
the  evolution  of  a  project  the  Committee  may
obtain additional information  from  an  investigator
or  summon  an  investigator  to  meet  with  the
Committee.  Simple  majority  voting  decides  each
case  and  the  Chairman’s  vote  is  decisive  in  the
case of a parity of votes. 

A  member  should  inform  the  Committee  of  any
circumstances  that  may  raise  doubts  about  their
competence  because  members  are  not  able  to
participate  in  a  project  which  concerns  their
personal  or  commercial  interests.  The  Committee
will  decide  if  a  member  cannot  participate  in  a
project because of a compromising interest.

THE HEALTH COUNCIL OF THE
NETHERLANDS
(GEZONDHEIDSRAAD)

scientific 

The Health Council of the Netherlands, established
in  1902,  is  a  legally  based  advisory  body  to  the
Dutch Government. 
Its mission is to provide government ministers, but
also  Parliament,  with 
information
relevant to issues of public health policy. It usually
does  so  by  drawing  up  advisory  reports  prepared
by multidisciplinary expert committees. 
If the work of the Health Council can be described
as ‘Health Technology Assessment’, this should be
taken  in  a  broad  sense,  as  including  the  ethical,
legal  and  societal  implications  of  scientific  and
technological  developments.  Historically 
this
‘normative’  aspect  has  gained  importance  in  the
work  of  the  Council  ever  since  the  1970’s.  From
that  period  onward,  ethical  and  legal  experts  and
also  social  scientists  are  often  included  in  the
composition  of  the  Council’s  ad  hoc  committees,
depending  of  course  on  the  specific  subject  on
which  that  committee  is  asked  to  report.  The
‘Standing  Committee  on  Medical  Ethics  and
Health  Law’  was  set  up  in  1977  with  a  view  of
coordinating this aspect of the advisory task of the
Council.  There  are  seven  other  of  such  standing
committees, 
the
Council’s  domain.  The  Standing  Committee  on
Medical  Ethics  and  Health  Law  functions  as  an
internal review board for all Health Council reports
dealing  with  ‘normatively  laden’  subjects.  It  also
has  an ‘early  warning’  function  and  may  draw  up
reports itself. The Standing Committee on Medical
Ethics  and  Health  Law  participates  in  several
international

Committees.

Monitoring Report Ethics and Health 2003

The  latest  development  is  a  reinforcement  of  the
meant  early  warning  function  in  the  field  of
bioethics. Both the Health Council and the Council
for  Public  Health  and  Health  Care  (RVZ),  whose
remit  is  more  in  the  field  of  organisational  and
strategic  aspects,  were  asked  to  publish  a  yearly
monitoring report, signalling developments which,
from  an  ethical  perspective,  are  relevant  for  the
agenda  of  public  policy.  Last  May,  both  Councils
published  their  first  reports  in  this  starting  series.
The  Standing  Committee  on  Medical  Ethics  and
Health Law has signed for the report by the Health
Council.  It  draws  attention  to  the  following  four
subjects:

New  developments  in  reproductive  genetics  and
medicine
Research in the overlapping fields of reproductive
genetics and reproductive medicine focuses on two
areas:  improving  the  possibilities  to  help  couples
with higher genetic risks to have healthy children,
and  improving  or  extending  existing  forms  of
reproductive  assistance  for  couples  with  fertility
problems.  The  report  looks  at  four  techniques  in
various  phases  of  development,  each  of  which
raises  specific  ethical  questions:  pre-implantation
genetic 
genetic
screening  for  aneuploidy,  ooplasm  transfer,  and
interspecies  transfer  of  spermatogonia.  General
recommendations  include  persistent  attention  for
the  possible  health  risks  of  medically  assisted
reproduction, the drawing up of guidelines and the
encouragement of public debate.

Screening  of  neonates  for  congenital  metabolic

In the Netherlands, neonatal screening using  heel-

detect  certain  severe  congenital  diseases

These

damage  to  health  can  be  prevented  with  dietary
measures or medication. However, not all of these
disorders  are  equally  well  understood;  some  of
them  occur  in  both  severe  and  mild  forms  and
levels  of  treatability  vary.  The  report  discusses
ethical questions arising in relation to the (further)

Medicines for children
Adults  who  are  prescribed  medicines  can  be  sure
that there has been extensive testing of safety and
efficacy  in  adults.  This  is  a  precondition  of
admission  to  the  market  (registration).  The  same
cannot  be  said  of  children.  Most  medicines  they
are  given  are  tested  in  adults  only,  but  not  in
children.  Often,  medicines  for  children  are  not
available  in  appropriate  forms  and  doses.  The
limited knowledge about medicines for children is
an 
phenomenon  with  which
paediatricians have been struggling for decades. It
is time to improve this situation by taking steps to

that  proper  attention  is  being  paid  to  training

The use of genetic, biomedical or pharmacological

characteristics  is  known  as  ‘enhancement’.  This
can  involve  people's  appearance,  performance  or
personality.  In  our  society,  adult  and  competent
individuals  are  themselves  responsible  for  the  use
of  enhancers,  at  least  in  so  far  as  they  cause  no
harm to others. In principle, the government should
adopt  a  neutral  position  towards  ideas  about
personal well being which are at the root of the use
of  enhancers.  It  does,  however,  have  a  major
responsibility  to  ensure  that  adequate  information

Centre for Ethics and Health

Together  with  this,  a  twin  report  by  the  above
mentioned  RVZ-Council  was  published.  This
report  draws  attention  to  health-care  settings  in
which  applying  the  principle  of  autonomy  may
require further qualification. For instance,  to  what
extent should cultural identity be acknowledged in
the  care  for  patients  with  a  specific  ethnic
background?  The  cooperation  with  the  RVZ-
council takes place under the name of “Centre for
Ethics  and  Health”.  This  centre  is  also  meant  to
serve  as  an  ‘ethical 
information  point’  for
interested professionals or the public at large. The
website (in Dutch) set up for this purpose contains
background information, references, and links.

The council meets on a monthly basis.  Issues that
are discussed may either have been referred to the
council, or may have been identified by the council
itself. Special experts are often invited to hearings
and  seminars  with  the  council.  The  discussions
may  result  in  an  official  statement  of  opinion,
which is most frequently addressed to the Minister
of Health and Social Affairs.
The  work  of  the  council  is  supported  by  a
secretariat.

THE ETHICS COMMITTEE OF THE
TURKISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
(ECTMA)

have begun to discuss this procedure in the Council
of  Health,  which  was  legally  established  in  1930
and  prohibited  the  application  of  such  techniques
in the absence of X – linked diseases. 

The  ECTMA,  which  had  its  first  meeting  in
February  1994  has  the  following  three  aims:  to
develop solutions to ethical problems on specified
issues  proposed  by 
the  Turkish  Medical
Association; to play a central role in the education
of  the  central  council  of  the  Turkish  Medical
Association  and 
to
the  physicians’  chamber; 
prepare certain working programmes on ethics.  

Members of the Committee are academics from the
fields  of  medicine,  dentistry,  biology,  nursing,
philosophy,  medical  sociology  /  anthropology  and
law who are interested in ‘health and ethics’. One
third of the Committee members are elected after a
three-year  period.  The  ECTMA  meets  twice  a
month  and  has  produced  more  than  seven  reports
during  its  first  year  of  activity.  The  meetings  are
closed  to  the  public  but  press  announcements  are
regularly  made.  The  Committee  strives 
for
consensus, using voting only when necessary.   

More recently, the ECTMA adopted an opinion on
the  role  of  physicians  in  treating  hunger  strikers,
which is summarised below.

some  essential  elements  of 

The  identity  of  physicians  has  undergone  great
changes  as  the  medical  profession  has  evolved.
However, 
the
physicians’  contract  with  society  remain  such  as
reliability,  honesty,  secrecy  and  the  duty  to  use
professional  skill  for  the  benefit  of  others.  At  the
same  time,  the  physician-patient  relationship  has
also  undergone  profound  changes.  It  has  moved
from being a paternalistic one in which the patient
is  passive  and  the  physician  active  to  one  of
‘sharing’ which involves mutual participation, trust
and co-operation. This in turn has led to a shift in
the  understanding  of  the  trust  involved  between  a
patient  and  a  physician  from  ‘unconditional  trust’
to ‘informed consent’.

As  a  result  of  certain  historical,  cultural  and
economic factors, the sexual preference of  society
in  Turkey  is  for  sons.  Because  of  this  preference,
some  sex  selection  firms  were  opened  and  sperm
separation methods are already being used. The use
of  these  procedures  without  permission  has  given
rise  to  new  ethical  and  legal  considerations.
Following the commercial advertisements of these
firms,  some  non-governmental  organisations  such
as  the  ECTMA  and  the  Turkish  Genetics  Society

An element of the original Hippocratic oath, which
has prevailed and is as crucial as autonomy, is the
impartiality of the physician in providing benefit to
patients.  It  is  this  impartiality  which  enables  trust
in  physicians  and  their  reliability.  However,  this
trust has been undermined in the past by abuses of
authority.  This  brought  about  a  more  balanced
view  of  the  patient’s  autonomy  in  relation  to  the
physician’s  paternalism.    It  has  also  made  issues
such  as  ‘coercive  intervention’  and  ‘coercive
hospitalisation’

situations  such  as  hunger  striking  where  the

In the case of hunger strikes physicians in Turkey

putting human life in top priority. It is neither the
physician’s  role  to  define  the  scope  of  this
impartiality  nor  are  they  to  act  as  ‘executors’  on
behalf  of  the  government.  It  is  therefore  neither
right nor acceptable to  require a  physician  to stop
an ongoing action. By respecting the decision of a

that  physicians  have  in  the  past  been  wrongly
accused of taking a political position in such cases.
As a result of this, a professional identity crisis has

However,  the  doctor  should  clearly  state  to  the
patient  whether  or  not  he  is  able  to  accept  the
patient’s decision to refuse treatment or, in case of
a coma, artificial feeding, thereby risking death. If
the  doctor  cannot  accept  the  patient’s  decision  to
refuse such aid, the patient would then be entitled
to be attended by another physician (1). 

However,  this  has  been  largely  ignored  in  local
approaches  and  enough  importance  has  not  been
given to the ‘moral status of physicians’.

resulting 

When considered theoretically, the hunger strike is
an  act 
from  a  personal  decision.
Therefore,  the  decision  to  go  on  hunger  strike  is
related  to  the  autonomy  of  the  person  and  any
action  countering  such  a  strike  must  respect  the
principle  of  autonomy.  The  freedom  to  go  on
hunger  strike  is  a  kind  of  freedom  which  can  be
enjoyed  only  in  an  unfavourable  situation  and
which will not be realised in a favourable situation.
But  depriving  oneself  of  the  things  that  sustain
one’s life is, in the case of hunger strikers, the only
expression  of  autonomy.  On  the  other  hand,  there
are  cases  of  hunger  strikes  which  have  lost  their
individual,  autonomous  nature  and  which  have
gone  through  changes  both  in  their  scope  and
meaning.  In  such  cases  it  is  imperative  for  the

redefined  by 

to  be 

What  should  be  our  position  as  physicians  in
Turkey,  where  hunger  strikes  and  death  fasts  are
apparent and  in  cases  where  individual  capacity
has  been  disabled?  It  must  be  stressed  that  the
consent of the patient is of crucial importance and
thus  the  physician  must  not  intervene  without  the
consent of the patient. 

Some  physicians  will  encounter  patients  refusing
treatment  or  life.  In  such  situations  the  physician
will  commonly 
respond  by  persuading  and
motivating  the  patient  to regain  the  desire  to  live.
However, such efforts may fail and  ultimately  the
responsibility  of  the  physician  is  towards  the
patient  and  not  any  third  party  or  institution.
Therefore,  any  action  taken  by  the  physician  to
stop  the  outcome  of  the  situation  should  not  put
him  in  a  position  of  guilt.  If  the  patient  is
unconscious, the decision to treat should be left to
the  discretion  of  the  physician  and  he  should  be
informed that he has the right to refuse to provide
treatment  if  his  religious,  ideological  or  sexual
identity  leads  him  to  believe  that  he  may  violate
the  patient’s  rights.  It  is  right  to  allow  the
physician,  who  is  in  such  cases  distressed  and
under  pressure,  to  act  freely  instead  of  labelling
him a ‘strike breaker’. Such cases involving human
rights  create  striking  ethical  dilemmas  for  the
physician  himself  as  well  as  the  society  in  which
he lives.

Pharmacogenetics: ethical issues

People  often  respond  differently  to  the  same
for
medicine.  Few  medicines  are  effective 
everyone;  many  cause  adverse  side-effects  and
sometimes  even  death.    These  different  responses
are  partly  due  to  our  different  genetic  make-up.
Research  in  pharmacogenetics  investigates  how
differences  in  our  genes  can  affect  the  way  in
which we respond to medicines.

The  Nuffield  Council  on  Bioethics  established  a
Working  Party  to  consider  the  topic,  and  will
publish  a  Report,  Pharmacogenetics:  ethical

The ethics of research involving animals

Many  people  are  concerned  about  the  use  of
animals  in  research.  There  is  also  widespread
recognition of the need for more medical research.
Since  much  of  this  currently  involves  the  use  of
animals, these two views are not easily reconciled.
The  Nuffield  Council  on  Bioethics,  recognising
that  people  feel  very  deeply  about  this  topic,  has
set  up  a  Working  Party  to  consider  the  ethical
issues  raised  by  research  involving  animals.    A
consultation exercise will be launched in October.
A background paper setting out some of the basic
issues  raised  by  animal  research  and  posing  a
number of questions will be available to download

The  Nuffield  Council  on  Bioethics  provoked
considerable discussion with the publication  of its
Report,  Genetically  modified  crops:  ethical  and
social  issues  in  1999.    Now,  four  years  on,  the
Council  has  decided  to  produce  a  follow-up
Discussion Paper, focusing specifically on the use
of genetically modified (GM)  crops  in developing
countries. The perspective of developing countries
is often neglected from discussions in the UK.   A
draft  version  of  the  Discussion  Paper  was  issued
for comment in June 2003.  The final Paper, which
takes  into  account  the  comments  received  from
individuals and organisations from both developed
and  developing  countries  will  be  published  in
November 2003.

The  Group  of  Advisers  to  the  European  Commission  on  the  Ethical  Implications  of
Biotechnology (GAEIB),

Having regard to the Article F2 (Human Rights) to the Common Provisions of the Treaty
on European Union,

Having  regard  to  the  international  Conventions  signed  by  all  Member  States  and
especially the European Patent Convention of Munich of 5 October 1973,

Having regard to the TRIPs Agreement (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights) annexed to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, ratified by
the European Communities (Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994),

Having regard to the proposal for a European Parliament and  Council  Directive  on the
legal  protection  of  biotechnological  inventions  (COM(95)  661  final)  of  13  December
1995,

Having regard to the public hearing in the European Parliament on 10 and 11 June 1996,

Having regard to the hearing that the GAEIB organized with Members of the Parliament,
experts and representatives of industry, research, patients and environment associations
on 24 June 1996,

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee of 11 July 1996 on
the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the legal protection of
biotechnological inventions,

Having  regard  to  the  report  read  by  Prof.  G.  Hottois  and  Prof  D.  Mieth  on  the  ethical
implications of patenting elements of human origin,

(cid:20)(cid:17)

:KHUHDV(cid:3)(cid:29)

1.1 Among  the  wide  ethical  problems  raised  by  the  issue  of  legal  protection  of
biotechnological  inventions,  the  scope  of  this  opinion,  following  the  request  of  the
Commission, is limited to the ethical aspects of patenting inventions involving elements
of human origin and concerning respect of human persons. The Group will not consider
in  this  opinion  other  ethical  aspects  related  to  the  proposal  for  a  Directive.  From  the
limited scope of the opinion nothing for or against the ethical acceptability of the other
provisions of the proposal can be derived.

1.2 The  proposal  for  a  Directive  submitted  to  the  opinion  of  the  Group  is  the  first
international  regulation  concerning  specifically  and  exclusively  biotechnological
inventions. It aims at harmonising national regulations and jurisprudence on patenting in
the  highly  innovative  field  of  biotechnology.  The  proposal  for  a  Directive  does  not
modify  the  rules  imposed  to  member  States  within  the  frame  of  existing  international
Conventions, particularly the European Patent Convention of Munich.

1.3 The present opinion considers the fact that a patent allows monopoly of exploitation of
an invention during a limited period of time, in general 20 years, in order to remunerate
an  inventor  as  compensation  for  his  (her)  intellectual  and  financial  research  efforts.  A
patent  in  itself  does  not  give  the  authorisation  to  use  or  commercialise  the  patented
invention.

1.4 The  questions  of  ethical  acceptability  and  safety  of  the  products,  for  health  and  the
environment, need to be considered in the context of the European Union. Appropriate
measures,  independently  of  patent  rights,  have  to  be  taken  before  the  marketing
authorisation of the considered products.

1.5 Patent right is one of the stimulants of medical research, since it allows compensation for
research  efforts,  the  progress  of  which,  in  the  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  fields,  will
benefit patients, in particular those affected by genetic diseases.

1.6 The need to consider moral concerns has been present, for a long time, in the European
patent  law.  Indeed,  patent  law,  contrary  to  other  laws,  traditionally  excludes  from
patentability  inventions  which  would  be  contrary  to  "public  order  or  morality".  These
two matters of exclusion are mentioned in the existing law, as well in Article 53 a) of the
European  Patent  Convention  of  Munich  as  in  the  National  laws  of  Members  States
which the Directive is aiming at harmonising. The proposal for a  Directive  takes place
within  this  moral  concern,  which  it  aims  to  actualise  and  adapt  to  the  specific  case  of
biotechnological  inventions  which,  when  they  are  based  on  elements  of  human  origin,
involve the issue of fundamental rights of the human person.

1.7 The  collection  or  sampling  of  elements  from  a  human  being  relies  on  the  consent,
cooperation  and  generosity  of  the  person  collaborating  in  the  research.  It  raises  ethical
questions concerning the information provided to the donor, his/her consent concerning
the future use of the elements, whether it is used for research  or  commercial purposes,
and the compensation he/she may claim.

(cid:21)(cid:17) 6XEPLWV(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)IROORZLQJ(cid:3)2SLQLRQ(cid:3)WR(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)(XURSHDQ(cid:3)&RPPLVVLRQ(cid:29)

2.1 Whatever  is  the  nature  of  the  biotechnological  invention  involving  elements  of  human
origin, the Directive must give sufficient guarantee(cid:3)so that refusal to grant a patent on an
invention  in  so  far  as  it  infringes  the  rights  of  the  person  and  the  respect  of  human
dignity  should  be  legally  founded.  Consequently,  the  consideration  of  patentability
criteria  resulting  from  the  usual  technical  requirements  of  novelty,  inventive  step  and
industrial  application,  must  also  take  into  account  consideration  of  these  ethical
principles.

2.2 The traditional distinction between discovery (not patentable) and invention (patentable)
involves,  in  the  field  of  biotechnology,  a  particular  ethical  dimension.  It  follows  from
this distinction that the knowledge related to the human body or its elements is relevant
to  scientific  discovery  and  cannot  be  patented.  It  has  to  be  clearly  specified  that  the
simple knowledge of the complete or partial structure of a gene cannot be patented.

2.3 The human  body,  at  different stages  of its  constitution  and  development, as well as  its
elements, do not constitute patentable inventions. Such an exclusion does not come only
from the usual conditions of patentability, but it is also inspired by the ethical principle
of non-commercialisation of the human body. Therefore no patent can be given on the
human body or on its elements. Also it follows that no remuneration to the person from
whom the samples are retrieved, or to his/her eligible party, can be allocated.

2.4 The ethical principle of informed and free  consent of  the person  from whom  retrievals
are  performed,  must  be  respected.  This  principle  includes  that  the  information  of  this
person is complete and specific, in particular on the potential patent application  on  the
invention which could be made from the use of this element. An invention based on the
use of elements of human origin, having been retrieved without respecting the principle
of consent will not fulfill the ethical requirements.

2.5 Concerning  the  inventions  issued  from  the  knowledge  of  a  human  gene  or  a  partial
human gene sequence, the granting of a patent is acceptable only if, on the one hand, the
identification of the function attached to a human gene, or a partial human gene sequence
allows  new  possibilities  (for  instance  the  production  of  new  drugs),  and,  on  the  other
hand, if the intended use of the patent is sufficiently specific and  identified.

2.6 The  complexity  and  sensitivity  of  the  issues  raised  by  patenting  in  the  field  of
biotechnology  require  us  to  make  every  effort  to  inform  citizens  of  the  technical,
scientific and social as well as ethical aspects of those issues.

2.7 The affirmation of the citizens rights in the European Union implies that the economical
advantages  derived  from  biotechnological  developments  should  in  no  way  affect  the
respect of ethical requirements.

In  accordance  with  its  mandate,  the  Group  of  Advisers  on  the  Ethical  Implications  of
Biotechnology submits this Opinion to the European Commission.

Professeur Dietmar Mieth adopts the present opinion but considers that the point 2.5 be completed with the
following text :

âA patent can be granted on an innovation capable of industrial application, which relates to an element of
human  origin,  like  an  isolated  gene,  if  this  element  has  been  essentially  changed.    It  is  not  essentially
changed if the structure of the element is identical to an element (gene) to be found in the human body or if
the genetic information is identical to the information of a human gene inside the human body.  The granting
of a patent is justified for an innovation that shows a new therapeutic application or use of a gene or a partial
sequence of an even unchanged gene.  In this cases â patent on process and patent on product â the need to
encourage  European  research  and  the  use  of  its  results  may  outweigh  other  aspects.    The  patent  must  not
cover the gene itself, but the specific identified use of the gene.â

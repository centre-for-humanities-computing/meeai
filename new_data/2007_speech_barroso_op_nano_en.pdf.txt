Presentation from the EGE of their Opinion n° 21 on the ethical aspects of nanomedicine 
to President Barroso, on 24 January 2007, in Brussels 

Speech of President Barroso to the EGE 

DEAR PRESIDENT, DEAR MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN GROUP ON ETHICS,  

I  WOULD  LIKE,  FIRST  OF  ALL,  TO  THANK  YOU  FOR  YOUR  EFFORTS  TO 
ISSUE  THE  OPINION  ON  ETHICS  OF  NANOMEDICINE  THAT  I  RECEIVE 
TODAY WITH INTEREST AND PLEASURE. 

I  KNOW  THAT  THE  PREPARATION  OF  THIS  OPINION  WAS  NOT  AN  EASY 
TASK.  IT  IS  DIFFICULT  TO  PROPERLY  ASSESS  THE  IMPLICATIONS  OF  A 
TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS STILL EXPLORING ITS POTENTIALS.  

MY  REQUEST  TO  THE  EGE  AIMED  AT  ASSESSING  THE  IMPLICATIONS  OF 
NANOMEDICINE 'TODAY'. IT IS IMPORTANT TO GIVE TO THE COMMISSION 
A  CLEAR  OPINION  ON  HOW  TO  FUNCTIONALLY  INTEGRATE  ETHICS  IN 
BOTH  THE  IMPLEMENTATION  AND  DESIGN  OF  THIS  POLICY  RESEARCH 
AREA,  AT  THE  EARLIEST  STAGE  POSSIBLE,  BEFORE  IT  IS  FURTHER 
DEVELOPED.   

ETHICALLY 

THE COMMISSION IS DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE, IN 
RESPONSIBLE  WAY, 
SAFE 
AN 
NANOTECHNOLOGY  AND  NANOMEDICINE  AT  EUROPEAN  UNION  LEVEL 
AND BEYOND.  

SOUND, 

AND 

RESEARCH IS A ONE OF THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE LISBON AGENDA. 
MORE  THAN  1.63  BILLION€  WERE  ALLOCATED  TO  NANOTECHNOLOGY 
UNDER  THE  PREVIOUS  EUROPEAN  UNION  PROGRAMME  FOR  RESEARCH 
AND  DEVELOPMENT.  THIS  AMOUNT  WILL  INCREASE  CONSIDERABLY  IN 
THE  CURRENT  PROGRAMME  FOR  RESEARCH  WHERE  IT  IS  EXTIMATED 
THAT 100 MILLION€ PER YEAR COULD BE ALLOCATED TO NANOMEDICINE 
AND  A  TOTAL 
INVESTMENT  OF  3.4  BILLION  €  TO  THE  ENTIRE 
NANOTECHNOLOGY SECTOR CAN BE EXPECTED. 

JOINT  PARTNERSHIPS  BETWEEN 
INDUSTRY  AND  THE  RESEARCH 
COMMUNITY  IN  EUROPEAN  NANOMEDICINE  COLLABORATIVE  RESEARCH 
MAY INCREASE THIS FINANCIAL EFFORT.   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NANOTECHNOLOGY,  AS  REFLECTED  IN  THE  CONCLUSIONS  OF  THE 
HAPTON COURT SUMMIT, IS EXPECTED TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE FOR THE 
PRODUCTION  OF  NEW  MATERIALS,  PRODUCTS,  SYSTEMS  AND  DRUGS. 
NANOMEDICINE  AND  NANOTECHNOLOGY  WILL  THEREFORE  BE  CLEAR 
EXAMPLES  OF  HOW  RESEARCH  AND  INNOVATION  MAY  CONVERGE  TO 
BOOST  COMPETITIVENESS  OF  EUROPEAN  INDUSTRY  AND  ALSO  IMPROVE 
THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF EUROPEAN CITIZENS.  

I REFER TO CITIZENS BECAUSE I AM CONVINCED THAT ON THE ONE HAND 
EUROPEAN CYTIZENS HAVE TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE DEBATE ON 
SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY;  ON  THE  OTHER  HAND,  SCIENCE  HAS  TO 
MEET SOCIETAL CONCERNS AND EXPECTATIONS AND BE IN COMPLIANCE 
WITH FUINDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES. IN THIS CONTEXT THE WORK 
OF THE EGE PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE. 

EUROPE  IS  A  DIMENSION  WHERE  DIFFERENT  CULTURES,  LANGUAGES 
Convictions  AND  RELIGIONS  CO-EXIST.  THIS  DIVERSITY  IS  A  STRENGHT  OF 
THE EUROPEAN UNION.  

EUROPE  IS  IN  THE  FIRST  PLACE  A  COMMUNITY  OF  VALUES,  BASED  ON 
TOLLERANCE, RESPECT AND DIALOGUE. the treaty states that the European Union 
is  based  "on  the  principles  of  liberty,  democracy,  respect  for  human  rights  and 
fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law". Furthermore, The  Commission is orienting 
its policies to be in compliance with the fundamental ethics values indicated, inter alia, in 
the european Charter of Fundamental Rights.  

THE  EGE  IS  AN  EXAMPLE  OF  THIS  POSITIVE  CULTURAL  DIVERSITY  AND  I 
LOOK FORWARD TO LEARN FROM YOUR OPINION HOW TO PROMOTE AND 
SUSTAIN NANOMEDICINE IN AN ETHICALLY MANNER. 

FROM MY SIDE I WILL ASK MY SERVICES TO DO THE NECESSARY SO THAT 
THE  OPINION  IS  IMPLEMENTED.  WITHIN  THE  COMMISSION  SERVICES  THE 
INTERSERVICE  GROUP  ON  NANOTECHNOLOGY, 
IN  CHARGE  OF 
IN  NANOTECHNOLOGY 
COORDINATING  THE  DIFFERENT  ACTIVITIES 
WITHIN THE COMMISSION, HAS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT YOUR OPINION IN 
THEIR FUTURE ACTIONS.  

AS  FOR  THE  FUTURE  WORK  OF  THE  GROUP,  I  KNOW  THAT  YOU  HAVE  AN 
HECTIC WORKING AGENDA FOR THE YEAR 2007. 

I HAVE REQUESTED YOU TO PROVIDE AN OPINION ON THE PRINCIPLES TO 
ENDORSE  IN  THE  ETHICS  REVIEW  OF  HUMAN  EMBRYONIC  STEM  CELLS 
PROJECTS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE 7TH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME. 
THIS  OPINION  WILL  BE  OF  HIGH  VALUE  SINCE  IT  WILL  ALLOW  THE 
COMMISSION TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENTING THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 
AND COUNCIL DECISION ESTABLISHING THE FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I  HAVE  ALSO  REQUESTED  THE  GROUP  TO  PRODUCE  AN  OPINION  ON 
ETHICS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR, INCLUDING, IF 
POSSIBLE  ANIMAL  CLONING  FOR  FOOD  PRODUCTION  PURPOSES,  A  TOPIC 
WIHCH  HAS  ACQUIRED  A  KEY  RELEVANCE  IN  THE  WORLD  FOLLOWING 
THE  DECISION  OF  THE  US  FOOD  AND  DRUGS  ADMINISTRATION  TO 
AUTHORISE  THE  INTRODUCTION  IN  THE  FOOD  MARKET  OF  CLONED 
ANIMALS. 

THE EFFORT I AM ASKING YOU AND THE GROUP TO MAKE, BY PRODUCING 
2  OPINIONS  IN  2007  IS  A  CLEAR  INDICATOR  OF  THE  ATTENTION  AND 
IMPORTANCE  I  PERSONALLY  ATTRIBUTE  TO  YOUR  WORK  AND  TO  THE 
ROLE OF ETHICS IN EUROPE.  

I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPINION YOU ARE ISSUING TO ME 
AND  TO  THE  COMMISSION,  AND  WOULD  ALSO  LIKE  TO  WISH  YOU  A 
SERENE AND FRUITFUL WORK DURING 2007.

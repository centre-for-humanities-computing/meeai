Foreword by José Manuel Barroso  

President of the European Commission

With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on lst December 2009, the enforcement of 
the Charter of Fundamental Rights is now guaranteed. It provides the comprehensive  basis 

for a Europe of rights and values. The Charter demonstrates that Europe in its diversity is 

based on a set of shared values that are intimately linked to the identity of the European 

Union. 

The European Union is founded on values: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, 

solidarity, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Promoting these, as well 

as peace and the well-being of the Union’s peoples, are the main objectives of the Union. 

That is why they were at the heart of the political guidelines for the next Commission 

I set out last year, and they are the driving force for the priorities of the newly established 

Commission: making a successful exit from the crisis; leading on climate action and energy 

effi ciency; boosting new sources of growth and social cohesion to renew our social market 

economy; advancing a people’s Europe with freedom and security; and opening a new era for 

global  Europe. In the science and society sector this will involve growth based on knowledge 

and innovation: improving our productivity by increasing our research and development 

and boosting innovation, better exploiting the potential of information and communication 

technologies and creating a digital single market, as well as raising education outcomes and 

promoting skills. All this has now been pulled together in a new strategy for Europe 2020. 

This strategy will only succeed if built on strong ethical foundations. In the science and new 

technologies sector the Commission is promoting a responsible use of science and techno-

logy, both within the EU and worldwide. The goal of the Commission is to strike a balance 

between ethical and socio-cultural diversity, both at EU level and globally in other regions of 

the world, while also respecting internationally recognised fundamental values. 

The number of policy areas covered by the Opinions of the European Group on Ethics in Sci-

ence and New Technologies is impressive. It has included ethical issues of pharmaceuticals, 

bio-safety, patenting, trade, agriculture, climate change, food security, embryo research, bio-

security, alternative energy, millennium development goals, and the global economy. These 

issues raise fundamental questions for our society, and the Commission has drawn on the 

recommendations to inform policymaking in areas of direct relevance for citizens. 

Concrete examples include the societal and ethical implications of nanotechnology as key 

 elements for EU research , the revision of the Common Agriculture Policy, the ethical review 

of EU funded human embryonic stem cells research projects, the interinstitutional debate on 

novel food regulation addressing animal cloning for food supply, and the ethical and  safety 

issues of synthetic biology; in all these areas, the Group’s recommendations have made a 

valuable contribution to the work of the European Union institutions. 

The European Group on Ethics has also helped to strengthen the European Union as a  global 

player. Last year the European Commission launched the EC international dialogue on 

 bioethics, where the Group, the Chairs of 15 non-EU National Ethics Councils from 5 conti-

nents and the Chairs of the EU 27 National Ethics Councils together share information, 

 create synergies and discuss the main bioethics topics.

During the years since 2005, the Group has played a leading role in the ethical debate at EU 

level, and I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere congratulations and 

thanks to the current President and to all the Members of the Group for the quality of their 

work, their dedication and their commitment to the European project over the past four 

years. The Commission will continue, together with the new European Group on Ethics, to 

ensure that the ethical aspects of science and technology remain at the core of the activities 

of the European Commission.

Introduction

A new landscape

Significant advances have taken place in science and new technologies in the last four years. 

For example, in stem cell research, the discovery of methods to reprogramme somatic cells 

has changed the scientific and ethical landscape, and a road map to clinical practice is on the 

drawing board. Genomic and post-genomics analyses, sequencing, microarray analyses and 

studies of epigenetics have provided a deeper understanding of the role and limits of biology. 

Hundreds of products based on nanotechnology are now available on the market, and in the 

future this technology is likely to change the conditions of human life. Information tech-

nologies have altered the patterns of communication and the reading habits of millions. Ad-

vances in ICTs and the neurosciences are stunning.

These developments have the potential to improve the lives of large sections of the world’s 

population and treat so far untreatable conditions. New, lighter and stronger nanomaterials 

may help to reduce the need for energy. Supplies of pure water and energy, especially in de-

veloping countries, may be enhanced by nanotechnologies. Current and future developments 

in information and communication technologies (ICTs) can help to prevent terrorist attacks. 

New and cheap vaccines may be produced with the help of methods explored, for example, 

through synthetic biology. Food security and sustainable production may be enhanced by 
novel technologies in agriculture. These developments, which have to be based on a proper 

balance between risks and benefits, also offer new opportunities to promote important hu-

man values, including human freedom, quality of life, and European competitiveness and 

protection of consumer rights.

At the same time some of these technologies may be used for surveillance, manipulation, 

and inadvertently to increase the gap between rich and less rich countries in Europe, and be-

tween developed and developing countries. When these technologies converge, new syner-

gies may result which call for analysis and a broad public debate on both their goals and the 

methods used for introducing them. In some cases this problem of dual use needs close atten-

tion, ethical analysis and perhaps regulation. This presents the policymakers with the chal-

lenge of optimising some uses of the technologies and minimising others. 

A community of values

The President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, honouring us with a pref-

ace to this activity report, has often stressed the vision of Europe as a community of values. 

This reflects an important change from the vision of EU as primarily a peace project and 

trade community, as in the early days of the coal and steel union. But there are different his-

torical, political, philosophical and religious traditions in Europe. This pluralism can be a 

source of strength, but there are undeniable conflicts in Europe between some of the values, 

as well as over the interpretation of these values.

The different interpretations of values need to be spelled out, and the tension between indi-
vidual and collective rights clarified. While policymakers have a responsibility for societal 

choices, for what is sanctioned by society, individuals have a responsibility for their own 
choices. One of the problems both individuals and societies have to cope with is the uncer-
tainties and knowledge gaps in many of these new and converging technologies. They make 

it difficult to anticipate what the consequences of many options will be. This is the back-

ground against which various precautionary approaches have to be evaluated.

Political events during the mandate

The present EGE’s term of office (2005-2009) has witnessed important political events. For 

example, the Lisbon Treaty has been accepted by the Member States, giving a new and more 

important status to the Charter of Fundamental Rights for European citizens (to which the 

EGE also contributed during its previous mandate). The Common Agricultural Policy has 

been revised, and the European Commission has taken initiatives to increase aid to and co-

operation with developing countries.

In the same period many other important changes have taken place in Europe and outside. 

The financial crisis has demonstrated how integrated the economies of the world are, and 

that a global approach is necessary to address many of the problems facing us today, e.g. 

those raised by genetically modified (GM) food, intellectual property rights (IPR), standards 

of food safety, climate change, medicinal products and medical devices, for the market is be-

coming more and more global.

The EGE activities

This activity report of the EGE for the period 2005 to 2009 gives an account of some of the 
ethical challenges facing European society. As part of its remit, the EGE has produced opin-

ions on subjects as diverse as nanomedicine, conditions for funding of human embryonic 
stem cell research in the EU 7th Framework Programme for research (FP7), animal cloning 
for food purposes, new technologies in agriculture and synthetic biology. The group has also 

published seven issues of the Newsletter ‘Ethically Speaking’, promoting the dialogue be-

tween the National Ethics Council and other international ethics bodies. Moreover, the EGE 

has arranged four public round tables, with all proceedings published — all this is described 

in more detail in the following pages of this report.

The EGE advises the European Commission, yet its opinions are widely read worldwide. 

Members of the EGE have also been invited to hearings in the European Parliament and the 

Council of Europe, and have briefed senior officers of the European Patent Office. In simple 

terms, the tasks of the EGE are to apply the norms, values and/or principles enshrined in in-

ternational and European declarations to problems facing European society in connection 

with pending EC legislation or current debates in the EC. The remit includes clarifying the 

problems, providing background information, describing the regulatory and scientific state 

of the art, outlining possible courses of action and giving advice to the Commission.

Changes in the work of the EGE

Important changes have also taken place in the work of the EGE, and will be described below 

in more detail. In my view, the most important changes are the following ones.

First, the topics of the opinions have changed, from focusing almost exclusively on ethical 

issues raised by trends in medical research and biotechnology to much wider issues, includ-

ing cloning of animals for food purposes and novel methods and techniques used in farm-

ing. These subjects cannot be discussed without touching on difficult ethical issues relat-
ed to rights and obligations, such as global and social justice, our responsibility towards the 

health and well-being of future generations, and animal welfare — as well as politically sen-

sitive and difficult issues relating to trade, economy and intellectual property rights, includ-

ing problems raised by World Trade Organisation (WTO), General Agreement on Tariffs and 

Trade (GATT) and the Doha round of trade negotiations.

Second, the normative framework used in the reports has been developed, from using more 

or less traditional principles in biomedical ethics to a framework rooted in theories of human 

rights. This development reflects the group’s thinking on the methods and assumptions of its 

work, but is also a result of its widening focus. In this wider focus, issues of global and social 

justice and human rights are inevitably prominent and need to be addressed.

Third, it has become very clear that many of the challenges facing European society today 

require a wider perspective than a strictly European one. In February 2009, the first Interna-

tional Dialogue on Bioethics took place on the initiative of the EGE and hosted by BEPA, in-

volving representatives from over 40 countries. The next international dialogue on bioethics 

will take place in March 2010, and this dialogue will continue on a yearly basis.

Fourth, and in line with the above, to increase transparency the working methods of the EGE 

have been widened to include web consultations — in addition to the traditional working 

methods of the group: internal meetings, hearings of experts, commissioning special studies 

on background material by external experts and arranging round tables. To enhance the effi-

ciency of the work of the group, we have also worked more closely than before with the Eu-

ropean Commission, resulting in better coordination of its various activities.

An interdisciplinary approach

The work in an international ethics committee is by nature interdisciplinary, and the dia-

logue between the members of the group is very important. The first task is to identify prob-

lems and assess developments in the near future. To do this successfully, different points of 

view are needed. And correct and clear information may change the perception of develop-

ments and trends from problematic to acceptable — or the reverse. 

Applying a particular normative framework to a set of challenges once they have been iden-
tified is rarely unproblematic; it can be done in more ways than one. In order to clarify the 

problems and the pros and cons of possible alternative options, a broad range of information 

is needed. Rights, norms and values need to be clarified and interpreted. The hearings of ex-

perts, as well as the round tables, provide an opportunity for dialogue with outsiders, as do 

the web consultations — all very important for the work of the group. These changes raise 

further topics for reflection, some of which will be discussed in the following pages.

Independence and integrity

For an ethics committee discussing controversial issues in a multicultural setting, indepen-

dence and integrity are essential. It would undermine the credibility of the group if it were 

seen as the megaphone of policymakers or lobby groups in Europe. The independence of the 

EGE has many dimensions, ranging from deciding its own working methods, which topics 

to address, how to deal with dissenting views… to deciding what to include in the reports 
and how to disseminate them1.

The future

The ethics landscape is not static. The problems are not solved once and for all. New chal-

lenges arise continuously. This is due to new developments in science and technology, to

challenges we see facing European society and which will need to be addressed in the future 

are described separately in the following pages.

Finally, I think I am speaking for all members of the EGE when I conclude by saying that it 
has been a privilege to take part in its work over these four years. I would also like to take 

this opportunity to thank all who have contributed, inside and outside the European Com-

mission; invited experts at hearings, speakers at round tables, and those who have sent in 

comments during our web consultations. For our work the support of the EGE secretariat has 

been indispensable.

1.  The role of ethics  

in the European Union 

1.1  The European Union as a community  

of values — the political manifesta-
tion in the ‘Charter’ and the ‘Treaty’

The European Union was created as an economic community of shared trade, and eventu-

ally it has developed further as political community thanks to common beliefs and ideals. 

From the beginning, there was a consensus that peace (the overarching goal of unification 

during the post-war era in Europe) was to be achieved only on the basis of democracy. Fur-

thermore, it was a shared belief that economic prosperity was bound to a free market and 

‘movement without borders’ within the Community — the latter being especially important 

with respect to the labour market. And finally, by affirming and adopting the UN Declara-

tion of Human Rights (not as a mere document, but as a concrete and responsible response 
to the atrocities of the early 20th century), the European Community gave primacy to respect 
for the dignity of every individual, as also advocated in the European Charter of fundamen-

tal rights and the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 

Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine (Oviedo 
19972). Democracy, freedom, human rights, equality and solidarity, based on the affirmation 
of pluralism and (political) subsidiarity, are pillars of Europe’s ethical self-understanding. 

Europe is not only constituted by the plurality of its traditions, histories, ethnic groups, cul-
tures and religions, but also, for example, by its different legal, education, social welfare and 

health-care systems. The recognition of this diversity and the respect for plurality have be-

come important driving forces in the unification process. In some areas, harmonisation is 

sought; in others, diversity is respected or even encouraged in order to sustain cultural plu-

ralism. The fundamental principle of European ethics is, ultimately, the principle of human 

dignity. The EGE has endorsed this principle in its various opinions, giving further clarifica-

tion to this debated principle for example in Opinion 20, quoting W. Cheshire who defines 

human dignity as 

‘the exalted moral status which every being of human origin 
uniquely  possesses.  Human  dignity  is  (…)  not  contingent 
upon any functional capacities which vary in degree. (…) 
The possession of human dignity carries certain immutable 
moral obligations. These include, concerning the treatment of 
all other human beings, the duty to preserve life, liberty, and 
the security of persons, and concerning animals and nature, 
responsibilities of stewardship.’3

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Lisbon Treaty

In May 2007, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome and following the 
political crisis after the referenda on the future of the Union, the Heads of State and Govern-

ment of the European Union adopted a political document (the Berlin Declaration) where the 

European political project was re-launched. This Declaration outlined the intention of all EU 

Member States to agree on a new Treaty to be ratified before mid-2009. 

The Declaration adopted an unprecedented approach in defining the EU’s policy objectives. In-

stead of advocating socio-economic goals, the Berlin Declaration pointed to the need for estab-

lishing a new dimension in the EU that is based on shared values. The Declaration states that 

‘EU  countries  are  striving  for  peace  and  freedom,  for 
democracy and the rule of law, for mutual respect and shared 
responsibility, for prosperity and security, for tolerance and 
participation, for justice and solidarity.’ 

This new target is endorsed in two important institutional steps taken the same year: the 

Charter of European Fundamental Rights and the Lisbon Treaty.

•	

On 12 December 2007, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights

4 was proclaimed by 
the Presidents of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European 

Council. 

For the first time in the European Union’s history, the European Union Charter of Funda-

mental Rights endorses in one single text the whole range of civil, political, economic and 

social rights of European citizens and all persons residing in the EU. The Charter endorses 

a set of important values, such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, protection of human 

rights, pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, and solidarity and gender equality. 

This political agreement has consolidated the relevance of these fundamental values for EU 

policy. This was not because the Charter was new (it had already been adopted in 2001 at the 

Nice Summit), but because it was conceived of as a tool to be fully integrated into the EU 

constitutional project and to acquire a legally binding force. 

The Treaty signed in Lisbon on 13 December 2007 is the result of negotiations between EU 

member countries in an intergovernmental conference, in which the Commission and Par-
liament were also involved. The Treaty was ratified by each of the EU’s 27 Member States. 
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States chose their own procedures 

for ratification, in line with national constitutions or practices. On 1 December 2009, the 

Treaty of Lisbon entered into force. It aims to provide the Union with a legal framework and 

the tools necessary to meet future challenges and to respond to citizens’ demands, such as a 

more democratic and transparent Europe, a more efficient Europe, a Europe of rights and val-

ues and Europe as an actor on the global stage. 

In particular, it introduces the notion of a Europe of rights and values: Human dignity, free-
dom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights are the core values 
of the EU which are set out at the beginning of the Treaty of Lisbon. They are common to 

all Member States, and any country wishing to become a member of the Union must respect

them. Promoting these values, as well as peace and the well-being of the Union’s peoples, are 

now the main objectives of the Union. These general objectives are supplemented by a list 

of more detailed ones, including the promotion of social justice and protection, and the fight 

against social exclusion and discrimination. The Treaty of Lisbon makes advances regard-

ing the protection of fundamental rights. It opens the way for the Union to be a signatory of 

the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 

In addition, the Treaty of Lisbon guarantees the enforcement of the Charter of Fundamental 

Rights. The EU has therefore acquired a whole range of civil, political, economic and social 

rights which are legally binding not only on the Union and its institutions, but also on the 

Member States as regards the implementation of Union law.

The adoption of the Charter and of the Treaty of Lisbon therefore launched the integration of 

EU fundamental values into the core political design of the EU. And this notion has been advo-

cated by, respectively, the first European Council President, Mr Van Rompuy, the President of 

the Commission, Mr Barroso, and the President of the European Parliament, Mr Jerzy Buzek. 

In his first speech after his nomination on 19 November 2009, Council President Van Rom-

puy advocated ‘Europe is a community of values’; and Commission President Barroso indicat-

ed to the European Parliament: ‘our union is founded on values: respect for human dignity, 

freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.’ (President Bar-

roso, Speaking with one voice: defining and defending the European interest, European Par-
liament Plenary: vote on new College, Strasbourg, 9 February 20105). European Parliament 
President Jerzy Buzek on the European Day against the Death Penalty (10 October 2009) said: 

‘The European Day against the death penalty is the day on which we recall that the defence 

of human rights and a justice system based on the full respect of human dignity is a key part 

of our shared European values’. 

1.2  

The role of ethics  
in the European Union 

While the widespread acceptance of moral and ethical concepts as founding principles of the Eu-

ropean Union is certainly encouraging, the role ethics should play in its day-to-day policy-mak-

ing is less clear. The following ideas are meant to encourage further discussion and reflection.

Challenges for Europe

The challenges faced by EU policies have not become any less daunting than fifty years ago 

when the unification of Europe began. And yet, the nature of these challenges has changed 

massively and they raise new ethical issues, as the following examples indicate:

curity, in a sustainable way. 

The return of (regional) wars and violence

 has not spared Europe. 

The displacement and migration of millions

 seeking a better or safer life does not stop at 

Europe’s doorstep and this phenomenon impacts on the cultural composition of Europe.

Globalisation

 has introduced economic, cultural and communicative changes, shifts, 

disruptions and possibilities to Europe which were never seen before, including the role 

it can play in international policies.

Demographic changes

ageing population;

Climate change

 continues to endanger the means of livelihood for all future genera-

tions.

New health threats

 such as HIV/AIDS, age-related health problems such as dementia, 

cardiovascular problems and obesity continue to spread and, with increased global mo-

bility, have started to spread faster. The rising costs of new therapies challenge equality 

of access to available medical treatment and have impacted on the traditional European 

public health system. 

•	

The limited access to or total 

lack of education for many persons, especially women, 

continues to cripple many regions around the world, hindering their social and econom-

ic advancement. 

•	

And, finally in this list, 

the new developments in science and new technologies con-

front Europe with many new concerns, not the least of them accompanied by the prob-

lem of a ‘technological divide’ both within Europe and in Europe’s relations with devel-

oping countries.

This list of challenges facing Europe is not exhaustive, but the following question needs to be 

addressed: How can these challenges be met in accordance with the set of values and rights 

endorsed in the Charter and Treaty? The overarching challenge for social cohesion and fur-

ther unification is undoubtedly that of balancing the respect for pluralism and diversity of 

traditions with the implementation of values-oriented European policies. 

Moral practices, ethical theories

‘Morality’ is generally understood as referring to divergent moral practices, while ‘ethics’ re-

fers to the philosophical analysis and assessment of these practices according to fundamen-

tal values and rights. 

In the European Union, moral beliefs are often surveyed via empirical analyses, in order to 

identify the views held by the citizens. The results of such empirical research are sometimes 

used as a basis for political decision-making procedures, without the intermediate step of 
ethical analysis based on values. More effort needs to be invested in building a European 

public sphere, for example, by using the new media. 

Despite the references to European values, it is not clear whose morality (or moralities) and 

which ethical approaches are put into action in the different policy-making procedures. 

 Ethics can be used to highlight the pluralism in value traditions, it can help to clarify the

 basic ethical concepts that play a role in different practical contexts; to systematise the 

methods of ethical assessment; and to assess the beliefs and convictions in the light of the 

principle of human dignity and human rights.

Europe as a community of values: ethical considerations

The Lisbon Treaty establishes for the first time a community based on fundamental rights 

and values. These values are the moral ideals of the intended European community, and the 
normative pillars supporting European policies6.

The understanding of the EU as a ‘community of values’ links moral self-understanding to 

‘strong evaluations’ (Charles Taylor) derived from historical and collective experiences. 

Up to this point, it is unclear how to understand the term ‘values’ in the various European 

texts, and their precise normative status is debatable. Apart from being a ‘moral source’ and 

orientation, are they (still) binding when transformed into political action? The concept and 

the status of values need further ethical clarification. 

Further explanation also seems necessary with respect to the relation between ‘European 

values’ and ‘global ethics.’ European values must be considered not so much as geographical 
but as constructive concepts, as Europe does not have a monopoly on these values. Human 

dignity being the central principle of European ethics should remind political actors of the 

enduring danger that human dignity may in fact be violated by everyone. 

In addition, even though some European societies may consider themselves as secular soci-

eties, religions remain a force promoting values. While this for some is the source of moral 

motivation, for others it is the source of concern. It may well serve as a test-case for how Eu-

rope will exercise respect and tolerance, while acknowledging the specific contributions any 
value tradition has to offer for the future plan of Europe’s societies.7 From an ethical point of 
view however, the litmus test for any conviction, based on religious or non-religious beliefs, 

is its coherence with the fundamental principle of dignity and the rights and values mani-

fested in the Charter and the Treaty. 

Science and new technologies — the role of the EGE

According to its remit the task of the EGE is to advise the Commission on ethical questions 

relating to science and new technologies. It is evident that the interpretation of ‘ethics’ with-
in the EU requires thorough analysis. The ethical framework of the Lisbon Treaty and the 
European Charter, together with respect for pluralism and diversity, must be taken into ac-

count when new developments in science and technologies are to be ethically assessed.

7 

 But is the European Union, taken as a moral community, a ‘community of rights’ or a ‘community of values’ 
— or both? The normative status of the claims stated in the Charter and the Treaty needs to be clarified in 
order to determine their role in policies. The first option, namely the understanding of the EU as community of 
rights, leads to a ‘normative’ framework that is strongly rooted in human rights. It links moral rights (ideally) 
to legally binding rights. The problem of this approach is the sketchy path from the normative prescription 
of moral rights to legal implementation and then to the actual lived self-understanding of citizens. The open 
question of the ‘community of rights’ is whether it is too distant from beliefs, traditions and histories, while 
the open question of the ‘community of values’ is its unclear relation to norms.

 Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) reads as follows: ‘1. The Union 
respects  and  does  not  prejudice  the  status  under  national  law  of  churches  and  religious  associations 
or  communities  in  the  Member  States.  2.  The  Union  equally  respects  the  status  under  national  law  of 
philosophical and non-confessional organisations. 3. Recognising their identity and their specific contribution, 
the Union shall maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with these churches and organisations.’.

a) Ethics as a philosophical discipline 

In the definition of ethics as a mode of reflection upon moral practices, the role of ethics differs 

depending on its institutional contexts. As an academic discipline (established generally with 

chairs of moral or practical philosophy, moral theology, political philosophy and social ethics), 

ethics reflects and analyses the different dimensions of the moral sphere. This is particularly 

evident with respect to basic concepts, methods, and normative claims of beliefs and convic-

tions, including the normative claims of cultural or religious traditions. In recent years ethics 

has been differentiated into a number of fields. These various ethical fields correspond to the 

various fields of human (professional) action. Thus, the discipline of ethics has developed new 

sub-disciplines of medical ethics or bioethics, business ethics, environmental ethics, informa-

tion ethics, etc. Academic institutions have funded positions for these different specialisations. 

Furthermore, risk analysis and, more generally, technology assessment, empirical analysis on 

value changes and views on different topics in moral psychology, social philosophy and so on 

all influence this academic discourse, making it increasingly interdisciplinary.

Interpreting the underlying claims of moral concepts is not usually considered part of moral 

practices, but is rather a task for ethics as a philosophical discipline within the humanities. 

In view of the remit of the EGE, this means that goals, means, and priorities within science 

and technologies are ethically relevant and need ethical analysis, as has often been argued. 

In order to utilise this sustained work of reflecting ethical challenges in European research 

policies and practices, the EGE has repeatedly called for more efforts to establish this kind 

of theoretical ethical deliberation and analysis routinely and on multiple levels as a comple-

ment to the dialogue of science and society. 

b) Ethics as political consultation

Ethics can also take a more practical form, namely as ethics in public policy, primarily in 

consultation bodies. Ethics committees have now been set up not only in the political sphere 

in almost every country of the European Union, but also in civil society and institutions 

such as hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and corporations. Biotechnology companies, for 

instance, increasingly set up ethics committees when working in fields that are contested 

in public debate. 

Over the past two decades, ethical reflections have been institutionalised in the sense that they 

are addressed by National Ethics Councils in most European countries. The Councils’ role is to 

stimulate general public debate, address ethical pluralism and to be consulted by political ac-

tors. The latter are the ones who have to implement ethics provisions in local policies.

This is precisely the role that EGE has taken in the past. The EGE is a body that attempts to 

come to conclusions via consensus. Even though this goal may not be achieved all the time, 

its discussions are structured within the group. To reach a consensus, the members need to 

consider each other’s statements and arguments seriously; they need to listen to each oth-

er’s explanations and moral backgrounds. And they need to practice the virtue of respect 

for others and grant each other the benefit of goodwill. All these virtues are part of the val-

ues promoted by the European Union to meet the standards of a democratic process of toler-

ant understanding which safeguards each member’s right to express his/her views freely and 

without fear, and the obligation to listen attentively to what the other says. These virtues 

are ideals adopted by the community of values which pledges to defend the right of each in-

dividual to be treated with respect. The EGE reflects the diversity and plurality that charac-

terise the European Union in its struggle to shape its ethical identity.

1.3 Embedding ethics  

in EU policies for science  
and new technologies

The ethical implications of science and technology are debated worldwide and the need for 
global governance of science has been advocated by several ethics bodies8. As a consequence, 
many international bodies (such as UNESCO9, WHO10, FAO, Council of Europe11 and the Eu-
ropean Commission) started to work on ethical guidelines, initiatives and actions to achieve 

this goal in the sectors for which they were responsible. European Union institutions and 

relevant bodies in the EU are included in this goal, and several initiatives are being promot-
ed to address bioethics issues at national and European level (e.g. EUREC12, NEC Forum and 
other similar initiatives). The question is whether it is possible to identify an EU approach to 

bioethics and clarify specific features of the European debate over the ethical implications 

of science and technology. 

As already stated, the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon was completed in December 2009, 
but the work of the European Commission in the fields of ethics of science and bioethics be-

gan much earlier. From a policy viewpoint, some examples of relevant EU policies embedding 
ethics into the policy sectors include the Science and Society Action Plan (COM(2001)71413), 
the Action Plan Life Sciences and Technology (COM(2007) 17514), the Nanotechnology  
Action Plan (COM(2007) 505 final15), etc. 

From a normative viewpoint, the list of Community regulations that are relevant to bioeth-
ics is long and also includes applications of biotechnology, information technologies and sev-

eral areas of biomedical sciences. Examples in the EU legislative sphere cover several dis-

parate areas of EU policy; from clinical trials (Directive 2001/20/EC) to patents (Directive 

98/44); from data protection (Directive 95/46) to research (FP) and medicinal products for hu-

man use (Directive 2001/83/EC and others, e.g. 2003/63/EC); from animals used for exper-

imental and other scientific purposes (Directive 86/609/EC) to animal welfare (Protocol to 

the Amsterdam Treaty) etc. Recent examples also include a Code of conduct for responsible 

nanosciences and nanotechnology research, adopted by the Commission in February 2008, 
to ensure the active contribution of the research community in identifying and monitoring 
possible risks and respecting fundamental rights, or (24 June 200916), the new EU Chemical, 
Biological, Radiological or Nuclear (CBRN) Action Plan, requiring education in bioethics for

ticular the Common Agricultural Policy (see the values-oriented revision of EU CAP in the 
analysis by the European Group of Ethics on science and technology18), global trade19, food 
safety20 and security policies.

The above examples are not exhaustive. The embedding of ethics into the EU policy design, 
in fact, includes creating platforms for debate between National Ethics Councils, interna-

tional affairs, Commission ‘in-house’ coordination, research funding and many other con-

crete activities being carried out by the European Commission and other EU institutions. 

Thematic examples of EU action on the ethical aspects of science and new technologies in-

clude research funding, networking, external activities and public perception of fundamen-

tal values.

Research funding

Since the 4th EU Framework Programme for research, the Commission has financed Europe-
an interdisciplinary research into the ethics of science and bioethics (ELSA Programme21 — 
FP4; Bioethics programme in Quality of Life22 — FP5; Ethics of science programme in Sci-
ence and Society — FP623). Under FP7 this research effort, which includes participation by 
developing countries, has been reinforced by financial support for ‘ethics, governance, hu-

man rights and democracy’ research projects under the Science, Economy and Society re-
search programme24. DG Research, with the help of external independent experts, also con-
ducts an ethics review for FP7 projects to check that Commission-funded research proposals 
involving issues of major significance on bioethics are ethically sound25 (e.g. use of human 
biological material, involvement of vulnerable people in research activities — children, el-

derly people etc., and use of non-human primates etc.)

Networking 

Ethical deliberation in politics started with medical ethics and bioethics but has become 

broader due to the societal impact of, for instance, information and communication technol-

ogy, agricultural technologies and nanotechnology. The Commission finances European de-

bates on bioethics and networking between relevant bioethics bodies. Some examples of net-

working activities promoted and supported by the Commission include: 

17 

 The  Action  Plan  also  outlines  three  main  areas  of  CBRN  security  work:  1)  Prevention  —  ensuring  that 
unauthorised  access  to  CBRN  materials  of  concern  is  as  difficult  as  possible;  2)  Detection  —  having  the 
capability to detect CBRN materials in order to prevent or respond to CBRN incidents; 3) Preparedness and 
response — being able to efficiently respond to incidents involving CBRN materials and recover from them as 
quickly as possible.

 In FP6, approximately 11 % of the Framework Programme proposals submitted are referred for ethical review, 
of which 45 % come from the health research area.

The Forum of National Ethics Councils (NEC Forum) established in 2003 by DG Re-

search and bringing together the National Ethics Councils of the Member States. It now 
involves all 27 Member States26. It consists of the chairpersons and the secretaries of the 
national ethics councils and meets twice a year to discuss developments in the field and 

to share information about best practice. 

b) 

The European Network of Research Ethics Committees (EUREC), which consists of al-

most all national associations of research ethics committees in Europe and is also man-

aged by DG RTD. 

Examples of efforts to encourage debate include public consultations (e.g. in 2007 the Com-

mission launched a public consultation on responsible nanosciences and nanotechnologies 
research27 and a public consultation on the ethics of animal cloning for food supply28) and 
conferences on issues of major significance in bioethics (e.g. scientific integrity29; human ge-
netics30; globalisation and research31; biometrics32, animal testing33 etc.) 

External activities 

The Commission represents the EU in a number of international fora dealing with bioethi-
cal issues, including the Council of Europe, which involves the Commission in the drafting 

of international documents (such as the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of 

the Council of Europe, UNESCO Declarations, OECD guidelines etc.). On November 27 and 
28, 2007, the Commission hosted the 7th meeting of the United Nations Inter-Agency Com-
mittee on Bioethics. 

In addition, the Commission has decided to step up activities on bioethics with non-EU 

countries. For example, an international platform on ethics for all National Ethics Commit-

tees or similar bodies dealing with bioethics was established in February 2009. Countries 

considered to be part of this initiative include: US, Canada, China, Brazil, India, Japan, Aus-

tralia, South Africa, Korea and some regional Bioethics Associations bringing together rele-

vant bodies in Africa, South America, and Asia. The platform is intended to encourage dis-
cussions and debate on the ethical, legal and social aspects of several international policies34 
and to implement the Commission’s position that the EU should promote peace, human 

rights and democracy worldwide. 

The examples here show that the embedding of ethics into EU policies has not only been 

agreed at the highest level of the EU, but also became a reality some time ago, as shown by 

the Community competences stated in the Treaty and the interinstitutional co-decision 
mechanisms. It is considered important for negotiations on international treaties to reflect 

the ethical positions adopted within the EU.

Public perception of fundamental values

As part of the spring standard Eurobarometer 693, a set of questions were put to respon-

dents on European values. The aim was to see if there is a basis of common values shared 

across the European Union and if so, to identify such values. The public perception survey 
(spring standard Eurobarometer 69335) was then published in July 2008. For Europeans, hu-
man rights, peace and democracy are the main values in Europe. Leaving aside issues relat-

ed to the relevance of specific values in different regions of the EU, these data show that the 

idea of Europe as a community of values is not ‘only’ a policy design of the EU but also a 

view shared by the general European public. The Eurobarometer figures still need to be in-

terpreted by correlating them specifically with the Opinions.

 This standard Eurobarometer was carried out between 25 March and 4 May 2008 in 31 countries or territories: 
the 27 Member States of the European Union, the three candidate countries (Croatia, the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia and Turkey) and the Turkish Cypriot Community. According to data from the above 
Eurobarometer, 54 % of respondents think that, in terms of shared values, the EU Member States are close to 
each other. http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/index_en.htm.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  The EGE Opinions  

and EU policies 

2.1 The role of the EGE  

in the embedding of ethics  
in EU policy design

In November 1991, the European Commission decided to incorporate ethics into the deci-

sion-making process for Community research and technological development policies by 

setting up the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology (GAEIB). The 

Commission decided on 16 December 1997 to replace the GAEIB by the European Group 

on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE), extending the Group’s mandate to cov-

er all areas of the application of science and technology. The EGE’s mandate was renewed by 

the Commission Decision of 26 March 2001 for a four-year period and its remit was slight-

ly modified to improve the Group’s working methods. The EGE’s mandate was decided on 

11 May 2005 (2005/383/EC), and extended by a Commission Decision of 14 October 2009 

(2009/757/EC). A new EGE mandate was adopted by Commission Decision on 23 Decem-

ber 2009 (C(2009)10353). As part of each Council Presidency, the EGE meets the Presidency 

country’s National Ethics Committee (NEC) and holds joint meetings with the NEC Forum 

(see below). The EGE issues its Opinions following a series of meetings, hearings with exter-
nal experts, and public round tables with relevant stakeholders36. 

According to the EGE Remit, the role of the EGE is to provide the Commission with high 

quality and independent advice on ethical aspects of science and new technologies to help 

prepare and implement EU legislation and policies. The EGE is therefore necessarily an in-

dependent, pluralist and multidisciplinary body. The EGE provides its advice either at the re-

quest of the European Commission or on its own initiative. The mutual independence of the 

two bodies is the key element that characterises the rationale and working link between the 

EGE and the EU institutions.

The work done by the EGE  
(2005-2010)

The EGE adopted five Opinions, had 45 working meetings, four public round tables and met 

the Forum of EU–27 National Ethics Councils under all Council Rotation Presidencies (UK, 

A, FI, DE, PT, SL, FR, CZ, and SE). The Group published five Opinions, four Round table pro-

ceedings, and seven issues of ‘Ethically speaking’. The above activities followed a precise 

strategy seeking transparency and inclusiveness as the main elements for the work of the 

EGE and its relationship with external stakeholders.

2.2.1 Transparency

EGE Selection and rules of procedures

The EGE members were selected by the European Commission President following an open 

call for applicants published on the web and publicised widely. This approach aimed to im-

prove the transparency of the selection process. It remains an unprecedentedly transparent 

approach which has no equivalent in EU National Ethics Councils or the advisory bodies of 

relevant international organisations. To further increase the transparency of the EGE’s work, 
its mandate and rules of procedures were also published on the internet37.

EGE website and publications of EGE documents

During the EGE’s 2005-2010 mandate, it decided to employ the EGE website as a communi-

cation tool, making information about the EGE and its work widely available to all interest-

ed parties. For the sake of transparency, the website is regularly updated with information 

on the EGE’s monthly meetings, including the agendas and presentations to invited speak-

ers. Information is also made available on public round table discussions organised by the 

EGE, including the videos of the discussions, the speeches and presentations given, and lists 

of participants. All EGE publications and press releases are published on the website, as well 

as many useful links, e.g. to the National Ethics Committees of EU Member states. A spe-

cial sub-page was created for the international dialogue on bioethics initiated by the EGE, 

containing all relevant information on the initiative. The mandate of the EGE, its rules of 

procedure, and the composition of current as well as previous EGE groups are all published 

on the website. Contact details of the EGE Secretariat are available for any inquiries. As a re-

sult, the number of visits to the website has risen steadily in recent years.

2.2.2 Inclusiveness

Open round tables

Before finalising each EGE Opinion, the Group was able to discuss the subjects with rele-

vant stakeholders (industry, civil society, patients, NGOs, representatives of churches and re-

ligious groups, etc.). To allow this consultation step, a number of round tables were organised 

prior the adoption of the EGE Opinions. The above round tables were open, free of charge and 

structured in such a way that participants had time and opportunity to speak directly to EGE 

members on issues they felt merited specific attention by the Group in preparing its Opin-

ions. To maximise participation in the discussion, the round tables were webstreamed and 

comments sent in by relevant parties were distributed to the Group.

Consultation and debate with EU–27 National Ethics Councils (NEC)

The EGE discussed the topics covered by its Opinions with the chairpersons and the secre-
taries of the EU–27 national ethics councils at the meetings of the NEC Forum38 hosted by 
the EU Council rotating presidencies (UK, A, FI, DE, PT, SL, FR, CZ, and SE). Joint EGE–

NEC Forum meetings were organised for this purpose. Representatives of the European Par-

liament were also invited to these events (STOA). The EGE was also having bilateral meet-

ings with NECs of all countries hosting the EU Council Rotating Presidency.

2.3  

Overview of EGE Recommendations 

The EGE adopted the following Opinions: Opinion No 21 on the ethical aspects of nanomed-

icine (December 2006); Opinion No 22 on the ethical review of human embryonic stem cell 

research projects financed by the European Union (July 2007); Opinion No 23 on the ethics 

of animal cloning for food supply (January 2008); Opinion No 24 on the ethics of modern de-

velopments in agricultural technologies (December 2008); Opinion No 25 on the ethics of 

synthetic biology (November 2009). For performing ethical analysis of a concrete scientific 

or technological area and producing its Opinions, as asked for by written requests from EC 

President Barroso, EGE used the following step-by-step approach, in consultation with exter-

nal stakeholders (experts, round table participants, EU–27 National Ethics Councils, Com-

mission services): 

1. 

familiarising itself with the 

state of the art of the science or technology in question as 

envisaged in the present, near future and a more distant future perspectives,

2. 

obtaining information on / 

overview of the relevant legal/regulatory framework of the 

scientific and/or technology area in question in the EU and EU Member States (check-

ing whether any important differences existed between relevant EU MS’ national legis-

lation) and internationally, 

3. 

identifying the ethical issues

 raised by the science/technology developments considered,

4. 

defining a 

general ethical framework to be used by the EGE to analyse the ethical issues 

identified and to develop its recommendations on how to deal with those ethical prob-

lems and/or dilemmas,

5. 

developing concrete 

recommendations/suggestions with regard to existing or novel EU 

policies to deal with the ethical issues (and, where appropriate, also with the legal and 

social implications) of the scientific/technological area analysed. 

From the thematic point of view, interestingly enough, the work of the EGE during this man-
date developed from dealing with the ethical issues stemming from novel biomedical re-

search and technology developments (nanomedicine, human embryonic stem cells), through 

the problems of certain biotechnology use in agriculture and food production (animal clon-

ing for food) to the broader analysis of novel technologies in agriculture, in particular with 

regard to crop production for food, feed, fibre and fuel (new technologies in agriculture) and 

finally embarking on reflection about emerging molecular biology developments touching on 

the very paradigm of biological life itself, as understood so far (synthetic biology).

The following paragraphs give a brief, non-exhaustive overview of the most important ethical 
issues dealt with and approaches used by EGE when producing its Opinions. Most of the text 

below is based on citations of the original wordings used by EGE in the recommendations 

developed in concrete science or technology areas. For a more detailed account, the reader is 

referred to the EGE Opinions themselves. As several of the ethical issues have come up re-

peatedly in EGE’s work on the Opinions, the following table gives an overview of recommen-

dations on them, as they appear in the respective EGE texts.

In its Opinions the EGE adopted a number of recommendations, such as the ones quoted be-

low. These reccomendations may be classified in different ways; one such classification is 

presented below 

I. General ethical considerations

The ethical framework of EGE’s reasoning, which has been used when approaching ethical 

issues under consideration, is usually described within the descriptive part of the Opinion. 

In some of the Opinions, however, some of the key ethical principles were pointed out or un-
derlined also in the language of the recommendations. Some examples are39: 

•	

As stated in many European and international documents, the interests of science are 

legitimate and justified insofar as they are compatible with human dignity and human 

rights [Opinion 21]. 

•	

New technologies are scrutinised with respect to the prospects of contributing to the im-

provement in human well-being they are aiming at, and with respect to possible threats 

to human well-being, be it at European or global level [Opinion 21].

•	

EGE recognises the need to promote responsible research that is transparent, serves the 
public interest, respects Member States’ autonomy, preserves public trust, promotes in-

ternational cooperation and requires the embedding of ethics within research practice. 

[Opinion 22] 

•	

As is the case in the European Union, there are divergent views within the EGE on the 

moral legitimacy of research on human embryos and hESCs, ranging from objection to 

research involving the destruction of human embryos (which makes the full respect of 

dignity of the human embryo impossible), to a position allowing hESC research under 

certain conditions or on a broader basis [Opinion 22]

•	

The fundamental rights include: protection rights such as protection of human life, re-

spect of its integrity, protection of health and freedom, political rights such as freedom 

from undue state intervention or participatory rights in political affairs, and positive 

rights such as basic social and economic rights insofar as these contribute to health and 

a threshold of development, resulting in health-related governance. […] The balancing of 

these three groups of fundamental rights is by no means easy or pre-determined. Rath-

er, it involves ongoing efforts to ensure their protection, granting and promotion of hu-

man dignity and human rights and, more concretely, it involves priority setting with re-
spect to health-related research. […] General criteria for research incentives in specific 

areas incorporate this balancing. They can be summarised as follows: scientific neces-

sity and high-ranking status of the research, urgency and social desirability, primacy of 

the interest and welfare of the human being over the sole interest of society or science. 

[Opinion 22]

•	

Social desirability is open to political and societal discourse on the goals and perspec-
tives of the European Union in the 21st century, in particular the relation between eco-
nomic growth and social goals, such as the promotion of healthcare standards and their 

sustainable application at national, international and global level. [Opinion 22]

•	

The EGE wishes to emphasise that embarking on cloning for food supply means open-

ing up a new dimension in the general context of breeding that is not merely technical, 

39

and which for some people may create a moral unease that cannot be simply dismissed 

[Opinion 23]. 

•	

The EGE calls for explicit embedding of ethical principles in agricultural policy (wheth-
er traditional or innovative) and argues that respect for human dignity and justice, two 

fundamental ethical principles, have to apply to production and distribution of food prod-

ucts too. In addition, the EGE calls for impact assessment of agricultural technologies 

[Opinion 24].

II. Safety 

The problem of safety, especially of the prospective risk evaluation and management (includ-

ing precautionary principle related considerations), has been among the most important con-

siderations when embarking on evaluation of the Ethical Legal and Social aspects of any nov-

el technological or scientific development and its possible practical applications. Examples of 

translation in concrete recommendations are given below: 

•	

Measures should be established to verify the safety of nanomedical products and to 

ensure that nanomedical devices are properly assessed with regard to public health 

 [Opinion 21].

The same level of safety currently applied to medicine and medical devices should then 

apply to nanomedical products [Opinion 21]. 

The Group proposes that institutions already operating at European and national level to 

protect the safety of patients and citizens should be charged with the additional task of 

overviewing the safety and security aspects of new tools and devices in nanomedicine. 

Networking of relevant bodies, at national, European and international level should then 

be encouraged to favour the proper implementation of safety measures and the adoption 

of common and validated standards [Opinion 21]

The Group considers it paramount that no nano-based products enter the market without 

risk assessment, thereby securing their safety with regard to users’ health [Opinion 21]. 

•	

Although the Group is aware of the importance of respecting animal welfare, it is con-

cerned that respect for human dignity may not be maintained when hESCs are used in 

toxicity testing of industrial or other commercially produced chemicals not related to 

drugs, such as cosmetics, or for replacement of animal testing. Therefore, particular at-

tention is to be drawn to this issue [Opinion 22].

•	

The EGE underlines the importance of guaranteeing the safety of food products for hu-

man consumption as a pre-condition for their marketing and stresses the importance of 
scientific updates and follow up research into progeny40 [Opinion 23]. 

Current EU legislation on food regarding traceability of animals and their food products 
should be enforced. It should be ensured that EU legislation provides for the ability to 

identify individual animals where necessary. [Opinion 23]

•	

The group considers food safety a prerequisite for production and marketing of food prod-

ucts from arable agriculture, including imports of agricultural commodities and products 

from third countries, and calls on the competent authorities to monitor enforcement of 

food safety provisions and the outcomes expected to achieve its goals, but also at ethi-

cal level (where members of society act and interact on the basis of commonly held val-

ues) [Opinion 24].

•	

The Group recommends that any use of synthetic biology should be conditional on spe-
cific safety issues identified in this Opinion. Therefore the Group asks the Commis-

sion to initiate a study on current risk assessment procedures in the EU. The study 

should: (a) make a survey of relevant bio-safety procedures, (b) identify possible gaps in 

the current bio-safety regulation to effectively assess organisms and novel products de-

veloped through synthetic biology; (c) indicate the mechanism to fill the identified gaps 

 [Opinion 25]. 

The identified risk assessment procedure should then be carried out by the competent 

Authorities within the EU (e.g. EC, EMEA and EFSA) and National Authorities. This 

should be conditional for financing of synthetic biology research and the marketing of 

synthetic biology products in the EU [Opinion 25]. 

The Group proposes that, when the above bio safety rules are defined, the Commission 

starts an international debate with relevant counterparts to facilitate a standardised ap-

proach to bio-safety of synthetic biology for public and private funded trials. Instruments 

for the monitoring of the implementation of such provisions should be conceived as inte-

gral part of the bio-safety rules (including liability issues) [Opinion 25]. 

Competent authorities properly monitor the authorisation procedures for the produc-

tion of synthetic biology-derived chemicals and materials, if not identical to equiva-

lent substances, by taking into consideration (a) risk assessment factors and (b) safety of 

workers exposed to synthetic biology chemical agents and (c) environment protection 

 [Opinion 25]. 

III. Biosecurity, prevention of bioterrorism, dual uses

Novel scientific and technological developments may pose a special safety risk when run-

ning out of control, or when used with malicious aims or goals (bio/terrorism, warfare). The 

EGE was clear on pointing out the urgent necessity of attending to these important threats 

and fears. Examples of the concrete formulations of the recommendations include: 

•	

The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling 

of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction should in-

corporate provisions on the limitation or prohibition of research in synthetic biology. 
 [Opinion 25] 

•	

The Group asks the Commission to define, in consultation with the EGE, a comprehen-

sive security and ethics framework for synthetic biology [Opinion 25]. 

•	

 The Group recommends that the European Commission 1) ensure that databases are 

available to all who use them; 2) Provides the legal systems for companies to report to 

Competent Authorities when asked to synthesise suspicious sequences whilst ensuring 

privacy; 3) Identifies the chain of responsibility for placing particular sequences in the 

database(s) and identifying them as potentially harmful [Opinion 25].

IV. Protection of environment and biodiversity 

The problem of protection of the environment, including preservation of biodiversity, vis à 

vis the development and implementation of new technologies has been among the central is-

sues of the EGE considerations. Hereby, some examples of the language used:

•	

The Group also draws attention to the specific problems that nanomedicine may give rise 

to in terms of toxicity and environmental problems [Opinion 21].

•	

The Group is concerned about the global impact of increasing meat consumption on the 
environment as cloning of farm animals could be another step in increasing such im-

pact. [Opinion 23]

•	

Farm animal biodiversity and sustainability – The Commission should take proper mea-

sures to preserve the genetic heritage of farm animal species, for example by funding 

projects that aim to preserve domesticated breeds in Europe and to promote sustainable 

agriculture [Opinion 23]. 

•	

The strong ecological impact of agriculture highlights the need to implement a different 

model of agriculture in the future: a sustainable and multi-functional agriculture where, 

apart from securing safe food for everybody, stewardship of the land, preservation of the 

resource base, the health of farm workers, preservation of the small biota that are rich in 

biodiversity, the value of rural communities and the value of the agricultural landscape 

acquire important status. [Opinion 24] 

From an ethical perspective, sustainable agricultural technologies should help to maxi-

mise use of natural resources while protecting them from exhaustion and thereby allow-

ing natural regeneration. In order to achieve this, the Group advocates that:

 -

there is a need to optimise processes involved in primary production, distribution 

and storage of food;

 -

use of arable land needs to be optimised and methods are needed to turn areas not ac-

cessible at present, due to adverse environmental conditions, into arable land;

 -

all other processes involved, “from farm to fork”, need to be optimised and simpli-

fied (to reduce harvest losses and waste and, where possible, to implement waste re-

cycling systems). [Opinion 24]

The Group is aware that any decrease in genetic diversity means fewer opportunities for 

the growth and innovation needed to boost agriculture at a time of soaring food prices 

and possible future food shortages. The Group is equally aware that any decline of the 

agricultural biodiversity used in food and agriculture has an impact on the sustainabil-

ity of agriculture (including its capacity to adapt to climate change or water shortages). 

The Group therefore supports action to protect this biodiversity, such as the Internation-

al Treaty for Plant Genetics and Resources and the Global Plan of Action for the conser-

vation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. This in-

volves setting up systems to store genetic information and seed in order to maintain crop 

diversity. [Opinion 24]

The Group recommends that before an organism, fabricated or modified via synthetic 

biology, is released into the environment, ecological long term impact assessment stud-

ies must be carried out. Data resulting from such studies should then be evaluated tak-

ing into account the precautionary principle and the measures foreseen in the EU legis-

lation (Directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified 

organisms). In the absence of a favourable assessment the release of organisms fabricated 

or modified should not be authorised [Opinion 25].

V. Alternative energy supply 

EGE tackled the pressing problem of alternative energies supply in connection with the prob-

lem of biofuels being produced by agriculture (Opinion 24) and the prospective use of syn-

thetic biology methods (Opinion 25): 

•	

The Group is aware that positions on the impact of biofuels on use of arable land are 

sharply divided. The Group recognises that introduction of biofuels in Europe could re-

duce Europe’s dependence on fuel imports and could be of interest to some farmers. The 

Group therefore considers that production of biofuels in Europe could be promoted, pro-

vided it does not interfere with food production, use of the fuels does not lead to any in-
crease in greenhouse gas emissions and, worldwide, no new land is cleared for biofuel 

production (e.g. in the form of deforestation). The development of second-generation bio-

fuels is important. Accordingly, the Group recommends that the infrastructure neces-

sary for these to be produced sustainably should be set up within the European Union. 

The Group therefore recommends that: 

 -

planting of crops for biofuel production should not interfere with food production, 

such as in the case of set-aside or marginal land;

 -

steps should be taken to recycle both crops and food waste in the production chain, 

using the biofuel derived from crop production in order significantly to improve the 
energy balance of biofuel production41;

 -

research should be funded, at EU and Member State levels, in order to obtain biofu-

el from waste materials, from non-edible parts of plants or from plant species that do 

not compete with food production or for resources such as water and land used for 

growing food; 

 -

 -

reduction of use of fossil fuels, especially in transport, should be promoted; 

infrastructure for second-generation biofuels should be promoted, financed and ad-

vanced in the European Union. [Opinion 24]

•	

The use of synthetic biology for alternative energy supply in EU Member States would 

be complementary to the EU renewable energy plan, and that international research tri-

als (e.g. EU-USA) be promoted and co-financed to favour an integrated international ap-

proach [Opinion 25].

VI. Animal welfare

The EGE considered the problem of animal welfare as especially relevant when dealing with 

the problems of animal cloning for food production purposes. Among other issues, EGE 

stressed the following: 

•	

In accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty (animals as sentient beings) and the Lisbon 

Treaty, additional requirements should be met in intensive animal breeding, with the 

aim of following the guidance on animal welfare provided by the World Organisation for 

Animal Health (OIE), e.g. the five freedoms: from hunger, thirst and malnutrition; from 

fear and distress; from physical and thermal discomfort; from pain, injury and disease; 

and to express normal patterns of behaviour [Opinion 23].

•	

Further studies and analyses on long-term animal welfare and health implications for 

clones and their offspring, as well as more comparative analyses with other assisted and 

traditional reproductive technologies in animal farming, should be carried out for a prop-

er assessment of this issue, in line with EFSA draft opinion. The Commission should 

take initiatives to prepare a Code of Conduct on responsible farm animal breeding, in-

cluding animal cloning. [Opinion 23]

•	

At present, the EGE does not see convincing arguments to justify the production of food 
from clones and their offspring42. [Opinion 23] 

VII. Food security and sustainable agriculture

Preparing its Opinion 24 in the context of the ongoing world food crisis, the EGE stressed the 

imperative of providing food for everyone (food security) and in a sustainable way as soon as 

possible and also in a long term perspective. Therefore, EGE called for an implementation of 

agricultural technologies contributing to reach these goals. Examples of the concrete recom-

mendations are given here: 

•	

Food and agriculture are means to an end that is not only technical, economic or politi-
cal in nature but also inherently ethical, namely to feed the world’s population while re-

specting future generations’ needs and expectations in terms of food security, safety and 

sustainability. [Opinion 24]

•	

The group considers the goals of food security, food safety and sustainability as first 

priorities and guiding principles to which any technology in agriculture must adhere 

 [Opinion 24]. 

•	

The starting point of any ethical agricultural policy must be the obligation of states and 
of the international community to secure all human beings’ right to food. Agricultural 

policies at national, EU and international levels must therefore aim, first and foremost, 

to secure access to food at regional, national and international levels, so that everyone 

has sufficient access to safe and healthy food corresponding to their particular cultural 

background and available scientific data [Opinion 24].

42  The conclusion in this paragraph was dissented by K. Marczewski.

VIII. Consumer rights

When commercialization of the new scientific and technological developments is fostered, 

the relevant rights of consumers should be respected, among those the right to choose from 

the variety of options being adequately informed. Examples of language the EGE used in this 

respect follow: 

•	

Medical tests of various kinds are currently offered for sale on the market, especially 

via Internet and other media, without medical prescription. In the near future such tests 

may also be based on applications of nanomedicine. [Opinion 21]

In order to protect consumers’ rights, the Group proposes that policies be developed to 

monitor the introduction of tests directly marketed to consumers, in line with the rele-

vant documents of the Council of Europe. [Opinion 21]

•	

The EGE is aware that import issues of food products derived from cloned animals, in-

cluding compliance with World Trade Organisations provisions, may complicate the mar-

ket situation. However, the EGE recommends that the Commission takes initiatives to 

ensure consumers’ freedom and rights. [Opinion 23]

The EGE is aware of the technical difficulties of labelling products from offspring, nev-

ertheless it recommends that the Commission takes the initiative to devise targeted pro-

cedures prior to the marketing of such food in the EU [Opinion 23]. 

•	

The protection of consumers´ rights is a key factor to consider in EU market and stress-

es that labelling of specific synthetic biology products, such as cosmetics and textiles, 

should be explored [Opinion 25]. 

IX. Biomedical research and health care

Special concerns in the development and implementation of new scientific and technological 

options in the realm of biomedicine arise in connection with these options being tested in 

clinical research with the participation of human subjects (healthy volunteers and patients) 

and their subsequent introduction into the medical practice and health care. Protection of 

human subjects, with regard to the foreseeable risks and ensuring just distribution of the re-

lated benefits and burdens are among the paramount requirements here. The EGE, especially 

in its Opinion 21, stressed the role of adequate ethical review provided by ethics committees 

or similar bodies, the role of competent authorities, as well as importance of a free, informed 

consent. Examples of the recommendations proposed are given below. 

Ethics review, ethics committees, competent authorities

•	

Nanomedicine, like other clinical research, is subject to the relevant EU legislation re-

quiring trials to be approved by local or regional ethics committees. Member States 

are thus responsible for making sure that there is an adequate ethical review process 

also for research projects involving studies of nanomedical devices on human beings 

 [Opinion 21]. 

•	

In addition to research on nanomedicine carried out at national level, a number of Euro-
pean or international research trials are being performed; the Group therefore proposes 

that initiatives should be taken to enhance information exchange between research eth-

ics committees in different Member States [Opinion 21].

•	

Further to the application of scientific and legal frameworks, specific ethics consider-

ations have also to be addressed by the competent Authorities (such as EMEA 217) when 

drugs and medical products will result from synthetic biology protocols. Data on medi-

cal applications of synthetic biology carried out in EU MSs or resulting from EU funding 

should be collected by relevant bodies in the countries where such trials take place and 

made available internationally [Opinion 25]. 

•	

Where morally sensitive means are to be used to achieve well-accepted goals - as in the 

case of human embryonic stem cells - where not the goal of therapy-oriented research is 

questioned but the means to accomplish it, the EGE holds that additional criteria apply 

concerning the necessity of the research: 1) non- availability of validated alternatives and 

(2) the non-redundancy of FP7 projects. […] Should alternatives to hESCs with the same 

potential as embryo-derived stem cells be found in the future, the implications of such 

developments for both scientific and ethical aspects of the hESC-based research projects 

ought to be taken into account as soon as possible. [Opinion 22]

Information and consent 

•	

Requirement for informed consent is of crucial importance in both medical research and 
health care. But both the lack of knowledge and the uncertainties that exist create prob-

lems for the attempts to provide adequate and understandable information and obtain 

consent that cannot exclusively be met by informed consent forms signed by patients. It 

is especially important to consider these problems in the context of developments that 

may contribute to a shift of responsibilities from the doctor to the patient. [Opinion 21] 

•	

The Group underlines the need to share relevant information among competent bodies 

and to properly address informed consent procedures with regard to safety. [Opinion 21] 

•	

The Group considers it important that initiatives are taken on different levels to help en-

sure that decision-making is in the long-term interest of the concerned citizens them-

selves. [Opinion 21] 

•	

Against this background, the Group encourages further efforts at national and Europe-

an level to develop improved methods of providing information and obtaining consent 

e.g. through research projects under the ELSI (Ethical, Legal and Social Implications) pro-

gramme. [Opinion 21]

X. Governance 

The requirements of adequate governance provisions and procedures in place, as well as 

their steady improvements in pro-active responding to the continuously emerging challeng-

es posed by the developments in science and new technologies realm were seen by EGE as 

necessary prerequisites enabling proper management thereof. In addition to the analysis of 

existing governance mechanisms already in place, as well as their possible weaknesses and 

needs for improvement given in the analytical – descriptive parts of the Opinions, the group 

stressed some of the relevant governance aspects also in the respective recommendations. 

Some examples of the language used are given here. 

•	

Monitoring is needed to ensure that regulatory systems exist to address all nanomedici-
nal products. Moreover the difference in the content of regulations e.o. regarding the con-

ditions of risk evaluation, the responsibility for its performance and the involvement of 

third parties should be addressed by the relevant Authorities. [Opinion 21]

Nanomedical products may combine different mechanisms of action, be they mechan-

ical, chemical, pharmacological or immunological, for instance. The mechanism of ac-

tion is a key factor in deciding whether a product should be regulated as a medicinal 

product or a medical device. [Opinion 21]

The Group proposes that possible cases of nanomedicine applications where there might 

be overlap between regulations, which could create uncertainty as to which regulations 

should be applied, should be explored by the relevant authorities so that the existing reg-

ulations can be implemented in an unambiguous way. [Opinion 21]

The Group proposes that networking between relevant authorities should be encouraged 

in order to deal in an optimal way with the problems outlined above, and that – if nec-

essary – new specific implementing measures should be derived from the current regu-

lations. [Opinion 21]

•	

EGE would also welcome interaction with the Advisory Board of the European Registry 
on hESC Research, in particular with the Registry’s Ethics Advisory Board, in order to 

address the ethical concerns regarding the procurement of stem cells and the storing of 

data in the light of the ongoing progress in this area [Opinion 22] 

•	

The Group urges the Commission to propose a robust governance framework for syn-

thetic biology and put it in place in the EU. The Commission should review the legisla-

tion applicable to synthetic biology and assess its relevance to address the issues raised 

by synthetic biology. The above framework should address relevant stakeholders (scien-

tists, industries, military agents, and political and administrative agents) and clearly in-

dicate their responsibilities. [Opinion 25]

•	

EGE Proposes that the EU takes up the question of governance of synthetic biology in 

relevant global fora [Opinion 25]. 

•	

Applicants should use hESCs banked in the EU Registry

43. The need to use other hESC 
lines in FP7 proposals must therefore be justified on both scientific and ethical grounds. 
[…] With regard to the use of the hESC lines banked in the Registry44, the EGE recom-
mends: Once the Registry is operational, after a necessary transitional period, the use 

of the hESC lines banked in the registry should be in line with the criteria indicated in 

IV.2.3. The Commission should develop and actively maintain the necessary means to 

ensure this requirement is fulfilled. [Opinion 22] 

Codes of Conduct guidelines

•	

The relevant science communities should be encouraged to establish ethical, preferably 

global, guidelines which may act as signposts and lead science institutions and individ-

ual researchers to assess the impact of their work including the consequences of misuse 

[Opinion 25].

•	

The Group advocates that a Code of Conduct for research on synthetic microorganisms 

should be prepared by the Commission. The Code should, for example, assure that syn-

thetic biology organisms are manufactured in a way that they cannot autonomously sur-

vive if accidental release into the environment would take place [Opinion 25].

XI. Intellectual property 

The EGE has devoted special attention to the problems of intellectual property rights, espe-

cially in connection with patenting and a possible creation of monopolies. It is often said that 

the purpose of the IP system is to ensure that innovation can occur and that inventors reap 

the rewards. Such monopolies, however, might not serve to facilitate the practical applica-

tion and accessibility of scientific and technological developments. The importance of inno-

vation is clear; the system must serve the interests of society as well of inventor. Examples 

of the recommendations include: 

•	

According to the current regulatory system for patenting, some exemptions are allowed 

with regard to the patentability of therapeutic and surgical procedures. The exemptions 

in the present patent system are based on a balance of interests whereby diagnosis, ther-

apy and research should be available to patients without patents being a hindrance. This 

is likely to be blurred because the new nanomaterials may logically fall within more 

than one category. To protect the ethical position that has led to these exemptions it is 

important to ensure that patents in these new areas do not alter the current balance. 

There are risks of overly broad patents being granted that may hinder their therapeutic 

availability. […] This is also the case for nanomedicine. The Group therefore draws at-

tention to the need for research into the manner in which the patent system can prop-

erly balance the need to reward innovation and ensure availability. This could lead to 

a more general review of the nature of the patent system in relation to new technolo-
gies that do not easily fit into a system devised in the 19th century, possibly with a fo-
cus on use or process patents rather than product patents. There is a need to look fur-

ther into the balance between knowledge protection and information dissemination. 

[Opinion 21]

•	

Comparative research on the merits and short comings of different patent systems in var-

ious parts of the world is needed. [Opinion 21]

•	

The current provisions for patenting hESC-derived materials need to be addressed. Given 

new developments in research and taking into consideration the ongoing debate on the 

limits of patenting of biological materials, the EGE would like to deal with this issue at 

a later point in time. [Opinion 22]. 

•	

The tension induced by a policy that encourages both free donation and commercial use 

of derivates from human substances needs to be addressed. [Opinion 22]

•	

The Group is concerned that patents might be extended to specific genes or to animals, 

and that this would lead to a monopoly/concentration of the resources that are impor-

tant for breeding [Opinion 23]. 

•	

The Group also advocates further clarification, inter alia, through research, on the appli-

cability of the exclusion clauses in Directive 98/44/EC (Art. 6) and the EPO rules (23 d) 

to animal cloning for food supply. [Opinion 23] 

•	

The EGE proposes that debates on the most appropriate ways to ensure the public 

access to the results of synthetic biology is launched. These debates should include 

also what can be object of patent and what should be available through open access 

 [Opinion 25].

•	

The EU Patent Directive (98/44/EC) defines the EGE as the Body to assess ethics impli-

cations related to patents. The Group urges the European Patent Office and the National 
Patent Offices to take account of Article 7 of the Patent Directive and refer contentious

ethical issues of a general relevance to the EGE for consideration. This is particularly im-

portant if a class of inventions that ought not to be directly exploited commercially has 

to be defined [Opinion 25]. 

XII. Trade and global justice 

The EGE has pointed out repeatedly in its Opinions that just sharing and distribution of the 

benefits and burdens of the development and application of new scientific and technological 

advancesn have acquired a global dimension. Examples of the recommendations proposed 

are given here. 

•	

Against this background the Group proposes that further initiatives be taken at nation-
al and European level to clarify the ways in which public investments in this area will 

benefit the citizens of Europe. The initiatives should be conducive to European econom-

ic growth and social welfare but also contribute to the UN Millennium Development 

Goals. [Opinion 21]

•	

The import of cloned animals, their offspring and materials derived from cloned animals 

(e.g. semen and food products) should be conditional on proper documentation, in partic-
ular with regard to traceability provisions and animal welfare [Opinion 23]. 

•	

The Group encourages and calls for development and promotion of the above-mentioned 

technologies in the EU and worldwide. In order to narrow the technological divide, the 

Group encourages development of specific measures, both within Europe and on a wid-

er global scale. Development and technology plans should, however, guarantee farmers’ 

and producers’ free choice of methods of production and promotion of new technologies 

for competitive local production. The Group also supports precision farming in the EU 

and in developing countries, where its advantages over conventional farming could be 

greatest. [Opinion 24]

•	

In agriculture, not only technologies have strong ethical implications but also trade and 
the framework for trade. The European Union accounts for 60% of official development 

assistance worldwide and yet food security cannot be guaranteed for about one billion 

people. The Group supports the key role which the EU is playing in promoting global aid 

for food security across the EU and worldwide. The Group supports the G20 decision to 

find a constructive agreement to bring the WTO Doha Round to a successful, rapid and 

pro-development conclusion. The Group is also aware that, to date, the EU has been a 

world player in agricultural trade, both as an importer and exporter of agricultural prod-

ucts, and urges the EU to take the identified priorities of food security, safety and sus-

tainability as ethical principles in its role in the global economy. [Opinion 24]

•	

To achieve the goals identified, global agricultural trade needs an ethical framework. Sol-

idarity, justice and free and fair trade in agricultural products and technologies are pri-

orities. The Group therefore advocates that the EU promotes a market system that in-

cludes aid for trade, fair (protected) trade and free trade and emphasises the importance 

of aid for technological development as laid down in the UN Millennium Development 

Goals. To try to achieve these goals, the Group advocates consideration of a new frame-

work for trade in agricultural products and urges policy-makers, relevant stakeholders 

and the international community to take into account the ethical principles and human 

rights laid down in the EU and UN declarations, and to follow the EGE in setting the pri-

orities of food security, safety and sustainability as ethical goals for the global agricul-

tural market. [Opinion 24]

•	

In accordance with the principle of justice, as indicated in section 9.12, the Group recom-

mends that the revision of the common agricultural policy, including subsidies, should 

take into account the effects of European policies on (a) trade with Europe and (b) local 

agricultural production in countries lacking sufficient production and access to food. In 

this way the EU could play an important role in promoting fair trade. [Opinion 24]

•	

The Group not only considers that sanitary and phytosanitary standards for imported 

agricultural products should match those required by the EU regulatory framework but 

also proposes that the measures provided for in the CAP, such as respect for consumers’ 

choices, animal welfare, biodiversity and socio-environmental protection, should also be 

taken as the basis for imports of agricultural goods into the EU. This should be progres-

sively implemented at multilateral or bilateral level. [Opinion 24]

•	

The EGE recommends that when synthetic biology is discussed at international level, 

including the WTO, the ethical issues associated to the technology should be addressed. 

This should be taken into account in the Doha round negotiations. [Opinion 25]

•	

The EGE urges that EU Biosafety standards for synthetic biology products as identified 

in recommendations N°1, 2 and 5 of this Opinion are adopted as minimal standards for 

EU import-export of synthetic biology products. [Opinion 25]

•	

The Group recommends specific EU actions to avoid new gaps between EU and develop-
ing and emerging countries, or within EU Members States, and to put into effect the rec-

ommendations expressed in this Opinion. Such actions should be introduced in bilateral 

and multilateral science programmes of the EU and in the EU policies concerning devel-

oping and emerging countries. [Opinion 25] 

XIII. Science and society dialogue 

The EGE has constantly stressed the importance of a vivid science and society dialogue as a 

necessary pre-requisite of a successful implementation of the scientific and technological de-

velopment in practice. Examples of the recommendations are given below.

•	

Transparency is essential for public trust. This also holds for openness about uncer-

tainties and knowledge gaps. Such transparency and openness should not be limited 

only to safety issues but should also extend to funding of research and development. 

 [Opinion 21]

•	

The Group proposes that initiatives should be taken at national and European level to 

prepare surveys of public perception of the benefits and risks of the applications of nano-

technologies, with special reference to medical sectors. […] The Group also recommends 

that there should be an EU website on ethics and nanomedicine which is updated regu-

larly, and where citizens can find information and raise questions. […] The Group finally 

proposes that initiatives be taken to organise academic and public debates on problems 

and possibilities of present and near-future nanomedicine. [Opinion 21]

•	

The Registry

45 should prepare and publish (on its website) information on the hESCs 
banked and on the positive and negative results of the research performed with/on the 

hESC lines provided to the researchers. At the project’s conclusion, in addition to the sci-

entific data, particularly health-related information, the publication of user-friendly in-

formation on hESC research, freely accessible to EU citizens, is also highly recommend-

ed. The portal should include interactive elements if possible. [Opinion 22] 

•	

Researchers working in the field have a responsibility to inform the public about their 

work, but also to engage with the social, political and ethical debates. With regard to 

open questions such as how to balance different rights and how to prioritise conflicting 

interests, researchers should participate in public discourse and respect the democratic 

decision-making process with regard to common societal goals. Applicants should there-

fore commit time, money and activities to advance the dialogue of science and society 

in the field of human embryonic stem cell research. Applicants for hESC research under 

FP7 are therefore strongly encouraged to include the science and humanities dialogue, 

i.e. social, cultural/religious, philosophical and ethical reflection on hESC research, in 

their projects and to collaborate for this purpose with other disciplines from the human-

ities. [Opinion 22]

•	

The Group therefore recommends that the Commission launch a thematic Eurobarome-

ter survey on animal cloning for food supply, in order to collect indicators on public per-

ception on the introduction of such products on to the food market as is being done in 

other countries. [Opinion 23]

•	

Public debates should be promoted on the impact of farm animal cloning on agriculture 

and environment, on societal impact of increasing meat consumption and rearing of bo-

vines, as well as on the fair distribution of food resources. The Commission should take 
a pro-active role in promoting public discussion on the use of animal cloning, and its po-

tential implications, by financing a number of ad hoc initiatives aimed at promoting pub-

lic debate on the marketing of food products derived from animal cloning. [Opinion 23] 

•	

The Group asks the EU and EU Member States to take actions to promote public debates 

and engagement amongst the stakeholders in order to identify main societal concerns in 

the different areas covered by synthetic biology. [Opinion 25] 

•	

The Group recommends that journalists, editors, including science editors, and other 

stakeholders promote responsible reporting on synthetic biology. [Opinion 25] 

•	

In order to promote a comprehensive approach to new technologies by the media the 

Group asks the Commission to stimulate specific actions, such as, inter alia, creating 

fora, seminars and courses, addressing the implications of synthetic biology in the me-

dia. [Opinion 25] 

•	

The Group notes that synthetic biology could lead, in the future, to a paradigm shift in 

understanding concepts of life. It therefore calls on the Commission to initiate an open 

intercultural forum to address the issues, to include philosophical and religious input 

[Opinion 25]. 

XIV. Research support 

The EGE has recognised the utmost importance of appropriate funding policies, at the na-

tional and at EU level, in order to promote developments in science and technology, taking 

into account not only commercial short term interests. The EGE has stressed the importance 

of sustainable development and growth in shorter as well as in long term perspectives. This 

is especially important with regard to basic scientific and technological research, including 

the research on safety and (bio) security issues, as well as the research on ELSI aspects, where 
the commercialisation and benefits are not foreseeable in the nearest future, or at all, and

therefore securing the appropriate funding of such research indeed poses a special challenge. 

Examples of the recommendations follow. 

•	

Furthermore, the Group suggests that the Commission should, inter alia, fund a study of 

the social effects of nanomedicine in the developing countries. Such research should also 

focus on macroeconomic trends, trade implications and possible international problems, 

and in particular examine the risk of creating a nano-divide which could widen the gap 

between the developed and developing countries. [Opinion 21]. 

•	

As the ethical conflicts concerning hESCs have not been resolved either academically or 

politically, the EGE recommends that, under the FP7, funding should be provided in order 

to foster further collaborative and multidisciplinary international research on the ethi-

cal implications of hESC research and the pertinent surrounding issues, as well as to en-

courage informed public debate. [Opinion 22]

•	

Further research is needed, in particular basic research on animal cloning, as well as 

impact on human health, animal welfare for farmed species other than those covered 

by EFSA. Similarly, further ethical, legal and social implications of animal cloning for 

food supply as well as qualitative studies on public perception should be carried out. 

 [Opinion 23]

•	

The Group invites the Commission to support basic research in the fields of biology, 

chemistry, energy and materials science and engineering and applied research as identi-

fied in this Opinion. This should be reflected in the R&D EU research Framework Pro-

grammes budget. A similar invitation is addressed to EU member states in their nation-

al R&D programmes. [Opinion 25]

•	

The Group requests the EU to properly finance interdisciplinary research on the follow-
ing aspects of synthetic biology: 1) risk assessment and safety; 2) security uses of syn-

thetic biology; 3) ethical, legal and social implications; 4) governance; 5) science and so-

ciety (including media and the public). This should be reflected in the R&D EU research 

Framework Programmes budget. Similar request is addressed to EU MS in their nation-

al R&D programmes. [Opinion 25] 

•	

The EGE emphasises its view that the use of human embryos to generate stem cells 

should be minimised as much as possible. The EGE calls on the European Union to de-

velop appropriate systems to minimise the use of human embryos to cases for which no 

alternatives exist. […] The EGE also acknowledges that a number of issues will need fur-

ther clarification, interdisciplinary research, thorough ethical evaluation and, if found 

necessary in the future, also appropriate legal action. At present, the EGE believes, the 

following issues require particular attention: 1. The current provisions for patenting 

hESC-derived materials need to be addressed. Given new developments in research and 

taking into consideration the ongoing debate on the limits of patenting of biological ma-

terials, the EGE would like to deal with this issue at a later point in time. 2. The tension 

induced by a policy that encourages both free donation and commercial use of derivates 

from human substances needs to be addressed. [Opinion 22]

In addition to the above EGE Recommendations, Prof. Krzysztof Marczewski advocat-

ed in his personal dissenting statement on Opinion 21 that “Having regard to insuffi-

cient risk evaluation, before this lack of knowledge will be overcome, the medical and 

health related application of nanotechnologies (e.g. cosmetics) should primarily be con-

centrated in to solving the problems in which a generally accepted traditionally alterna-

tive not exist”.

EGE Opinions and EU policies

Several of the European Commission’s decisions are consistent with EGE Recommendations. 

Although it cannot be claimed that the Commission took these decisions because they were 

recommended by the EGE, it can be shown that the decisions are in line with the EGE pro-

posals. Some examples that illustrate this link between the EGE and the decision-making 

process of the EU (with the Council and the Parliament as key actors in the co-decision pro-

cedures) are the following: 

As far as EGE Opinion No 21 on the ethical aspects of nanomedicine (17 January 2007) is 

concerned, in Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies: An action plan for Europe 2005-2009 

– Second Implementation Report 2007-2009 the Commission indicates that nanotechnolo-

gy products must comply with the high levels of consumer, worker and environmental pro-

tection set in Community regulations. These products will enjoy public acceptance only if 

these regulations adequately address the new challenges from the technologies. In June 2008, 
the Commission adopted the Communication ‘Regulatory aspects of nanomaterials’,46 ful-
filling a commitment made in the Action Plan. The Communication was accompanied by 

a Staff Working Document providing a summary of legislation in relation to health, safety 

and environmental aspects of nanomaterials, and outlining regulatory research needs and 
related measures.47 This regulatory review concluded that existing Community regulatory 
frameworks cover in principle the potential health, safety and environmental risks related 

to nanomaterials. Without excluding regulatory change in the light of new information, the 

Commission stressed that the protection of health, safety and the environment needs to be 

enhanced mainly by improving the implementation of current legislation. In addition to sup-

porting research on risk assessment, the Commission is working in several regulatory areas 

to improve implementation, assess the adequacy of existing legislation, and consider wheth-
er regulatory change on specific aspects is necessary.48

The Communication was examined by both the European Parliament49 and the Europe-
an Economic and Social Committee.50 The European Parliament in particular questioned 
whether, in the absence of explicit provisions for nanotechnology in Community law, legis-

lation can be deemed adequate to cover the risks related to nanomaterials. Given the lack of 

appropriate data and assessment methods, the Parliament asked that existing regulations be 

carefully reviewed. At the request of the European Parliament, specific provisions in relation 

to nanomaterials have been introduced or are being considered for legislation on cosmetics, 

novel food and food additives. As planned, the Commission will present an updated regula-

tory review in 2011, paying particular attention to the points raised by the European Parlia-

ment and the European Economic and Social Committee. The Commission has supported 

innovation in nanotechnology through different policies and actions. The main initiatives 

related to nanotechnology include: Increased emphasis on applications in the research fund-

ed under FP7; a continued commitment to regulatory and standardisation activities; and the 
creation of a nanotechnology observatory, ObservatoryNANO,51 to study opportunities and 
risks in various technology sectors. In this context, special attention is paid to SMEs and 

start-ups.

Several measures pursued the general objective of taking people’s expectations and concerns 

into account. In February 2008, the Commission adopted the recommendation for a ‘Code 
of Conduct for responsible nanosciences and nanotechnologies research’,52 which provides 
guidelines favouring a responsible and open approach. As called for by the Council in Sep-
tember 2008,53 the Commission will regularly monitor the Code, and revise it every two 
years to take account of developments in nanotechnology and their integration in Europe-

an society.

All FP7 proposals that are considered for funding and raise ethical issues undergo a thor-

ough ethical review. This includes many nanotechnology proposals. Such proposals must 

discuss the ethical dimension of the research to be undertaken and meet Community ethi-

cal requirements, such as the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in addition to national re-

quirements. A particular requirement in EU policy relates to the promotion of alternatives 

to animal testing. The Commission has established a partnership with industry and funds 

research into alternative testing methods.

Several outreach projects have been funded under FP6 and FP7. These suggest that there is a 
need for a more permanent public deliberation on nanotechnology in its broad societal con-

text. Public dialogue and public engagement are probably most effective at the national lev-

el. Nevertheless, the Commission has pursued an active policy of engagement and consulta-

tion with stakeholders, in particular through the continuous involvement of stakeholders in 

Commission working groups charged with coordinating the implementation of regulation; 

and in the annual nanotechnology ‘Safety for Success Dialogue’ workshops.

The call for dialogue and engagement in the Action Plan has also been reflected in various 

other initiatives organised by industry, in European Technology Platforms and in special in-

terest forums such as consumers’ groups. The existence of diverse fora indicates a need to 

monitor the debates at national, European and international levels, for instance with support 
from future FP7 activities, in order consistently to convey messages from public debates to 

policy makers. The Commission has published a wide range of informative material in many 

languages and for various age groups. And a specific entry for nanotechnology on the Com-

mission’s Europa website helps the public to follow all its nanotechnology activities.

The above EGE Opinion was also discussed together with EGE and all EU National Ethics 
Councils at the 8th NEC Forum, 21-22 September 2006, Helsinki, Finland. Several EU NECs 
have accordingly issued Opinions on Nanotechnology, namely IT, FR, NL and IRL. 

As far as EGE Opinion No 22 on the recommendations on the ethical review of hESC FP7 

research projects (20 June 2007) is concerned, the Commission has carried out a systemat-

51  Resolution of 24 April 2009 on regulatory aspects of nanomaterials (2008/2208(INI)).

ic  ethics review of FP7 hESC projects. All Opinions of the Commission Ethics Review Pan-

els on FP7 research proposals involving hESCs have taken account of this Opinion (especially 

sections IV.2.1 General criteria and IV.2.2 Ethical criteria for research projects). The Opin-
ion was also mentioned in the reference material for applicants for FP7 research funding54. 
The EGE suggested that the following considerations should apply to hESC funded by the EU:  

1) FP7 hESC lines have to result from non-implanted IVF embryos; 2) hESC lines banked in 

the European Registry should be used where possible; 3) If alternatives to hESC with the same 

scientific potential as embryo-derived stem cells are found in the future, their use should be 

maximised; 4) Donors’ rights (in terms of health, informed consent, data protection and free 

donation) have to be protected and safeguarded; 5) Action to stimulate public debate on this 

research area is needed at EU level. Following President Obama’s request (9 March 2009), on 

6 July 2009 the NIH released the final guidelines for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) re-

search, implementing President Obama’s Executive Order 13505 ‘Removing Barriers to Re-

sponsible Scientific Research Involving Human Stem Cells,’ which overturned the prior ad-

ministration’s policy restricting federal funding to research using hESC lines derived before  

9 August 2001. The final NIH guidelines require that 1) the embryos were donated with the 

informed consent of the embryo donor without any restriction or direction regarding who 

may receive medical benefit from the use of the stem cells, 2) no payments were offered for 

the donated embryos and 3) the donors should not receive financial or any other benefit from 

the use of the stem cells. The NIH Guidelines are in line with the EGE Recommendations. 

As far as EGE Opinion No 23 on the ethical aspects of animal cloning for food supply (16 Jan-

uary 2008) is concerned, in February 2007, after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 

announced possible authorisation to place on the market food products derived from cloned 

cattle, pigs and goats, Commission President Barroso asked the European Group on Ethics 

in Science and New Technologies (EGE) to draft an Opinion on the ethical implications of 

cloning animals for food. In parallel, the Commission asked the European Food Safety Au-

thority (EFSA) to provide a scientific opinion on food safety, animal health and welfare and 

the environmental impact of animals derived from cloning and their offspring. After sever-

al months of expert hearings, a public consultation on the Europa website (800 contributions 

received), a consultation with the Forum of EU–27 National Ethics Councils and a round ta-

ble with stakeholders from academia, industry, NGOs, civil society, international organisa-
tions and industry55, on 23 January 2008 the EGE delivered its Opinion on the ethical aspects 
of animal cloning for food supply56 to President Barroso. In its Opinion, the Group stated 
that animal welfare and health are affected by animal cloning for food supply, in particular 
the welfare and health of surrogate dams and the first generation of clones. The Group ex-

pressed doubts about whether the current situation as regards the welfare and health of an-

imal clones is ethically justified by the existing arguments in support of cloning for food. 

The Group advocated that, in the absence of proper data, this consideration cannot be ex-

tended to clones’ offspring. Under these conditions, the EGE did not see good enough rea-

sons to endorse production of food from clones and their offspring at present. On the other 

hand, the Group did not see any categorical reason to propose a ban. The EGE also asked the 

Commission, amongst other things, to launch a thematic Eurobarometer survey on animal 

cloning for food supply and to promote public discussion on this specific use of animal bio-

technology.

On 24 July 2008 the European Food Safety Agency’s (EFSA) parallel final opinion was re-

leased. The EFSA acknowledged uncertainties in risk assessment because of the limited evi-

dence base and concluded that, in relation to food safety, there is no indication that differenc-

es exist between meat and milk from clones and their progeny and from conventionally bred 

animals. The EFSA opinion recognises that there are significant animal health and welfare is-

sues that can be more frequent and severe for clones than for conventionally bred animals. 

In response to the EGE’s request, in July 2008 the Commission launched a Eurobarometer 

survey on EU consumers’ attitudes to cloning for food production. The results were pub-
lished in October 200857. They found that EU citizens were not willing to accept animal 
cloning for food production purposes: the majority of respondents (58 %) said that such clon-

ing should never be justified. The main reasons for rejection of cloning by the vast majority 

of EU citizens were: the long-term effects of animal cloning on nature are unknown (84 %); 

animal cloning is morally wrong (61 %); and animal cloning might decrease genetic diversi-

ty within livestock populations (63 %). According to the Eurobarometer survey, 84 % of EU 

citizens said that their greatest concern was that not enough is known about the potential 

long-term health and safety effects of using cloned animals for food and three quarters agreed 

that there could be ethical grounds for rejecting animal cloning. Almost four out of every  

10 respondents (38 %) answered that none of the potential benefits suggested to them (health 

or economic) would justify breeding cloned animals for food production. On the other hand, 

around 60 % answered that cloning would be acceptable for specific purposes (e.g. preserva-

tion of rare species or breeds).

Following publication of the EGE and EFSA Opinions, in February 2008 the Chairman of the 

European Parliament’s Agriculture Committee, supported by several members of the Euro-

pean Parliament’s Intergroup on Animal Welfare, tabled a motion for a resolution calling on 

the European Commission to ban all food from cloned animals in the European Union, along 

with imports of food derived from cloned animals and their offspring. This motion was ad-

opted in September 2008, with 622 votes in favour, 32 against and 25 abstentions. 

The Council’s and the Commission’s positions concerning legislation covering cloning are 

now expected soon.

As far as EGE Opinion No 24 on the ethics of modern developments in agricultural technol-

ogies (17 December 2008) is concerned, in this Opinion the EGE develops an ethical frame-

work for modern developments in agriculture technologies. According to the Opinion, the 

EGE is aware of the need to promote innovation in agriculture but it is equally aware that 
technologies alone cannot provide final solutions to the challenges modern agriculture is fac-

ing in the EU and worldwide. The Group however supports all technologies in agriculture in-

sofar they are conducive to the goals and priorities indicated in this Opinion. 

The Group also emphasises the need for an integrated view and an integrated approach on ag-

riculture technologies so that the production, storage and distribution processes are consid-

ered together when the implications of any new technology are assessed ethically. The Group 

considers the goals of (1) food security, (2) food safety and (3) sustainability as first priorities 

and guiding principles to which any technology in agriculture must adhere. Therefore the 

Group recommends an integrated approach in agriculture, based on a system where its con-

stituent units are balanced, not just at a technical level (where there is a continuous assess-

ment of the balance between required input, e.g. resources, energy etc., and expected out-

comes to assure its goals) but also at an ethical level (where members of society interact and 

act on the basis of commonly held values). 

The EGE calls for the explicit embedding of ethical principles in agriculture policy (whether 

traditional or innovative) and it argues that respect for human dignity and justice, two fun-

damental ethical principles, must apply to the production and distribution of food products 

too. The Group also advocates integrating ethics in WTO rules on trade in agricultural com-

modities. 

Using this ethical framework as a point of departure, the EGE in this opinion also makes rec-

ommendations on a plethora of issues, such as: revision of EU Common Agricultural Policy, 

technology impact assessment of agricultural technologies; the right to food; Sustainability 

of agriculture technologies; Food safety; Agricultural biodiversity; Soil and water protection; 

Biofuels; Genetically Modified (GM) crops; Research in agricultural sciences; policy-making 

in arable agriculture; Global trade in agricultural products; Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) 

system; Fair competition and ‘vertical monopolies’; Food prices; Societal aspects; Public par-

ticipation; Responsibility of EU citizens; Food waste etc. Examples of EC actions in line with 

EGE requests included (inter alia), the latest policy review, dubbed the Common Agricultur-

al Policy (CAP) Health Check and launched in 2008, aimed to further modernise the poli-

cy and assess whether adjustments are needed to ensure that it is still relevant for new chal-

lenges, such as climate change. 

The EU–27 also agreed to further cut direct subsidies to farmers, for the benefit of rural de-

velopment policy, and to abolish milk production quotas. While subsidising production on a 

large scale and buying up surpluses in the interests of food security are now largely consid-

ered policies of the past, soaring global food prices in 2008 have prompted a renewed debate 

about maintaining sufficient subsidies to the EU farming sector, as some argue that feeding 

people cannot be left to the mercy of the market. 2009 will see debate on the CAP’s future 

beyond 2013, in the context of a general review of the EU budget.

The Health Check modernises, simplifies and streamlines the CAP and removes restrictions 

on farmers, helping them to better respond to signals from the market and to face new chal-

lenges. For example, it abolishes the requirement to leave 10 % of arable land fallow, increas-

es milk quotas gradually leading to their abolition in 2015 and uses market intervention (EU 

purchase of excess supply) as a safety net when food prices are unsustainably low. In addi-

tion, direct payments to farmers will be reduced and the money transferred to a fund for the 

development of rural regions. The EU guarantees its consumers the authenticity and quali-
ty of organic farming products from around the world through strict rules on their labelling 

and traceability. 

The EU’s Rural Development Policy seeks to maintain the vitality of the countryside through 

the balanced development of rural areas. It is an important part of the CAP. The budget for 

2007–13 for all 27 Member States amounts to € 92 billion (current prices). Rural development 

funds can be used for both agricultural and non-agricultural activities, such as: extending 

broadband coverage; helping small businesses; helping the food processing industry; extend-

ing childcare so that more mothers living in rural areas can return to work. 

EU countries set their own priorities for rural development, but must spend at least 10 % 

of their budget to boost the competitiveness of their farming and forestry sectors, at least 

25 % to improve the environment and the countryside and at least 10 % to diversify the ru-

ral economy. Each country formulates a national strategy for rural development but specific 

programmes can be designed and implemented at regional level. Regional development pol-

icy provides help mainly to the most disadvantaged regions of the EU. Rural development 

policy applies to all regions in all countries. Rural development policy today not only helps 

farmers but also people participating in the rural economy like forest owners, farm work-

ers, small business, local non-governmental organisations, etc. Each rural development pro-

gramme must include measures for the protection and enhancement of the EU’s natural re-

sources and landscapes in rural areas. Rural development money is given in exchange and 

as compensation for actions that not only protect and preserve the EU countryside, but also 

help fight climate change. Examples include: preserving water quality; sustainable land man-

agement; planting trees to prevent erosion and floods.

During  the  2007–08  crisis,  the  European  Union  let  farmers  increase  their  production 

of cereals and milk and temporarily suspended import duties for all cereals except oats. 

Among other things, it is also planning to abolish quotas on production to allow farmers to 

maximise their production potential, revise the food security programme for the EU’s poor-

est people and increase aid to poor people outside the EU. The EU Ministers have already 

granted € 1 billion to developing countries for 2008–10, primarily for improving food supply 

and access to fertilisers and seed. Under the reformed CAP the incentive is not to produce 

more, but to produce in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly way. The CAP stops pay-

ments to farmers who do not respect its basic environmental requirements. It also uses more 

and more of its budget to stimulate extensive and organic farming, landscape preservation 

and habitat and biodiversity conservation, all of which ultimately protect our environment. 

The EU provides more trade-related assistance to developing countries than the rest of the 

world put together — almost € 1 billion a year for the last 2–3 years. The EU takes in 58 % 

of the agricultural exports of the least-developed countries (€ 2.79 billion in 2007), as well as 

60 % of Africa’s and 45 % of Latin America’s farm exports. It is by far the biggest agricultur-

al importer from these regions. Food quality is guaranteed through labelling, marketing and 

quality rules, such as the protection of geographical indications, obligatory nutritional in-

formation on labels, quality logos and animal welfare standards. The EU has improved food 

safety significantly since the food scares of the 1990s and now protects it through hygiene 

measures, rules on animal and plant health and control of pesticide residues and additives in 

food, to give only a few examples.

EU institutions and member countries must take into account animal health and animal 

welfare when formulating and implementing laws and policies. Under the CAP, farmers must 

respect animal welfare standards and are given incentives to improve animal welfare even 

further.

As far as EGE Opinion No 25 on the ethics of synthetic biology (17 November 2009) is con-
cerned, in its Opinion the EGE identifies and addresses ethical concerns particularly (but not 

exclusively) from the point of view of safety and security. Beyond this, ethical reflection ad-

dresses justice, governance, the dialogue between science and society, intellectual property 

and concepts of life. In its Opinion the EGE proposes a number of specific recommendations 

on synthetic biology, addressing, inter alia, issues related safety; impact assessment of envi-

ronmental applications; use of synthetic biology for alternative energy supply in EU Member 

States, labelling of specific synthetic biology products, such as cosmetics and textiles; eth-

ics considerations for approval and marketing of drugs and medical products that may result 

from synthetic biology protocols; biosecurity, prevention of bioterrorism and dual use; gov-

ernance framework for synthetic biology, identifying the relevant stakeholders and indicat-

ing their responsibilities; patenting; trade and global justice (WTO rules, import export etc.); 

public debates, support for basic research in the fields of biology, chemistry, energy, materi-

als science, and engineering, as well as applied and interdisciplinary research, also on the 

paradigm shift in understanding concepts of life (including philosophical and religious in-

put). The EGE adopted its Opinion on 18 November 2009, so it is difficult to describe EU ac-

tion in line with EGE requests, but some examples include EU action on biosecurity, open 

access, research and biosafety.

Over the past ten to fifteen years, the threat of a terrorist group acquiring Chemical, Biolog-

ical, Radiological or Nuclear (CBRN) materials has led governments and international or-
ganisations to adopt far-reaching regulations58 and programmes to defend populations against 
the associated risks. Tackling terrorist access to CBRN material is currently considered a 
key priority for the European Union.59 On 24 June 2009,60 the Commission adopted an ac-
tion plan defining the new EU CBRN policy.61 The Action Plan sets out three main areas of 
CBRN security work: 1) Prevention — ensuring that unauthorised access to CBRN materi-

als of concern is as difficult as possible; 2) Detection — having the capability to detect CBRN 

materials in order to prevent or respond to CBRN incidents; 3) Preparedness and response 

— being able to efficiently respond to incidents involving CBRN materials and recover from 

them as quickly as possible. The most important part of current EU external relations policy 

related to the CBRN threat is the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass De-

struction — also known as the EU WMD strategy, adopted in December 2003. This Strategy 

was recently updated and reviewed, resulting in the adoption by the Council of ‘New lines 

for action by the European Union in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc-
tion and their delivery systems’ in December 2008.62 From the public health perspective, the 
Commission has presented a Communication on health security in 2009, outlining the in-

ternal and external aspects of health security.

As for open access issues, in 2007 the Council invited the Commission to experiment with 
Open Access (OA) for projects funded by the 7th Framework Programme. In 2008 the Com-
mission launched an Open Access Pilot in FP7. It applies to seven areas including energy, en-

vironment and health, covering around 20 % of the FP7 budget. In 2009, the Commission 

sent a questionnaire to the members of the CREST (Scientific and Technical Research Com-

mittee) to take stock of the situation in Europe. Many funding bodies already implement 

Open Access policies for the research that they fund, e.g. the Wellcome Trust and many of 

the Research Councils in the UK; the Research Council for Science, Engineering and Tech-

nology in Ireland; the Superior Institute of Health in Italy; INSERM in France; the German 

Research Foundation in Germany; and many others. The EU Research programme has in-

corporated OA rules in several FP7 Research sectors, namely, ‘Health’, ‘Energy’, ‘Environ-

ment’, ‘Information & Communication Technology’ (Cognitive systems/robotics), ‘Research 

infrastructures’ (e-infrastructures); ‘Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities’, ‘Science in 

Society. Other actions taken by the EC include: 2007: Communication COM(2007)56 on 

‘Scientific information in the digital age: access, dissemination and preservation’; Council 

Conclusions on ‘Scientific information in the digital age’; 2008: European Council Conclu-

58  Such as UN Security Council Resolution 1540.

59 

 The Council Conclusions of 6 December 2007 ‘addressing Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear risks 
and on bio-preparedness’ provide the most recent EU-level overview of ongoing activities.

60  COM(2009) 273 final ; SEC(2009) 874 ; SEC(2009) 790 ; SEC(2009) 791.

61 

 The EU CBRN Action Plan is not a legal instrument. Immediate legal and budgetary consequences for the 
EU could only derive from possible future legal instruments implementing the Action Plan, which would be 
subject to separate prior impact assessment — including an assessment of their impact on economic sectors 
and research environments and systematic and rigorous monitoring to ensure compatibility with the Charter 
of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

As far as the EGE request to launch a global debate on the ethics of science and new technol-

ogy (EGE Activity report) is concerned, on 19 February 2009, the first meeting of the EC in-

ternational dialogue on bioethics was held, organised by the European Commission (BEPA) 

at the request of the European Group on Ethics of science and new technologies (EGE). The 

International Dialogue aimed to facilitate information sharing and open dialogue in the 

field of bioethics between European and non-European National Ethics Councils (NECs). 

The event was chaired by the President of EGE, Prof. Göran Hermerén, and the Chair of the 

National Ethics Council of the European Union Member State holding the Council Presi-
dency and representing the EU–27 NEC Forum, Prof. Josef Kuře. Dr Noëlle Lenoir, former 
French Minister of EU Affairs and former President of the EGE, gave a keynote speech fol-

lowing the opening address by the Chair of the European Parliament’s Scientific Technolo-

gy Options Assessment commission (STOA), Mr Philippe Busquin, and the Commissioner 

for education, training, culture and youth, Mr Ján Figel. Participants at this event includ-

ed the members of the EGE, the Chairs of 15 non-EU NECs, the Chairs of the EU–27 NECs 

and representatives of international organisations. The non-European countries represent-

ed were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, 

Philippines, Russia, South Africa, USA, and PABIN (Pan African Bioethics Initiative, an Af-

rican ethics network together with COPAB (Pan African Bioethics Congress) a cluster of Af-

rican NECs). EU–27 NECs were all represented, with the exception of Bulgaria and Cyprus, 

which were unable to attend due to other commitments. In total, National Ethics Councils 

(NEC) from 40 countries, representatives of UNESCO, WHO, EP (STOA) and the Commis-

sion attended the meeting. The Chairs of all 40 NECs unanimously agreed that this event 

should be held on an annual basis, with the Commission taking the initiative and provid-

ing the secretariat.

Future challenges 

Introduction

Many different developments influence the ethical themes and challenges individuals and 

political institutions face. The work and the focus of the Group has itself evolved in relation 

to these developments. An important change is the widening of its scope from the ‘classical’ 

field of ethical issues in medical research and biotechnology, to taking up wider themes such 

as ethical aspects of modern agricultural technologies. On the basis of its work and experi-

ence in the past years, the Group has identified some challenges that will have to be faced 

and deserve to be discussed in the future. This is a non-exhaustive list.

As suggested in chapter two of this report, these challenges are not located in a political or 

moral vacuum, but have to be seen in light of the societal background of important develop-

ments: the development of science and technologies, and ethical deliberation and decision-

making, all take place within a wider context. 

There are ethical issues that have a particular European dimension and which will have an 
impact on the ethical analysis of issues related to science and new technologies (for example 

free circulation of patients in the EU). Besides, ethical dimensions can also be at the heart of 

priority-setting in European research and technology and in the European economic strate-

gy – Europe 2020. 

On many levels and in many different fields important developments influence the stage at 

which ethical deliberation and decision-making take place. As most have been outlined in 

earlier chapters we will only summarise here: 

•	

the 

global challenges facing the EU, but not only the EU (e.g. climate change, the eco-

nomic crisis); 

•	

changes within the EU itself

 (e.g. new tasks for EU institutions, the new Member States, 

changing opinions and practices of governance); 

•	

demographic changes

 (e.g. a different composition of populations due to an ageing popu-

lation, more chronic diseases; more multiple diagnoses, more neurodegenerative diseas-

es/dementia);

•	

changing views on the relation between science and society

 (e.g. the responsibilities of 

scientists and the involvement of society, open access);

•	

 in different areas (e.g. the neurosciences, imaging techniques, 
scientific developments
and the important phenomenon of converging technologies, e.g. nano-medicine and ICTs) 

as the convergence of different technologies and disciplines, such as synthetic biology, 

raise new ethical issues and may also lead to new risks.

In this complex architecture of interrelated political, scientific, technological, cultural, ide-

ological and social challenges, the task of the European Group (EGE) is to contribute to eth-

ical reflection.

Some challenges 

Surveillance technologies 

Internet profiling, body scans, the use of different bio-identification tools such as fingerprint-

ing, chips inserted into humans, iris photos, biometrics, Radio Frequency Identifier Devices 

and other surveillance methods, if used for the identification and the traceability of individ-

uals, could lead to a leakage of vital and controversial biological information, e.g. on poten-

tial lethal diseases, and will continue to raise hard questions. This also applies to using ICTs 

for identifying all kinds of objects and locations, particularly when combined with personal 

data or stored in databases. The information held in databases may well infringe the rights 

of the individuals identified, and mechanisms must be put in place to ensure the ethical use 

of information. This area, where medical and non-medical technologies meet, will remain 
an important theme for the future: it is one where values such as privacy64, bodily integrity, 
safety and autonomy are at stake, may come into conflict, and have to be balanced.

Massive amounts of data 

Massive sequencing, in combination with epidemiological information, raises new issues. 

Besides the tendency for technologies themselves to converge and combine, a growing con-

cern is dealing with combination and convergence of data and various kinds of informa-

tion. Massive amounts of data and data flows, often through internet platforms, have exist-

ed for years in genomics and there is now an explosion of sequence data. Similar massive 

amounts of data are now produced in other domains of biology (proteomics, metabolomics 

etc.) but they are also developing in epidemiology and other fields. For such data to be proper-

ly analysed and interpreted, they need to be linked to clinical and lifestyle data on individu-

als and groups. Biological data bases are diversifying, and are linked to large-scale biobanks 

and various other data bases at national, European and international level, involving increas-

ing cross-border exchanges of data. This generates ethical issues that need to be evaluated 

in terms of individual and group protection, such as the possibility of re-identification when 

combining data sets that independently are not identifiable. Also the direct access of con-

sumers to many kinds of information that may be sensitive, among them genetic informa-

tion, changes the landscape of personal information flow. The status of data may have dif-

ferent status as regards their level of interpretation and their clinical or social usefulness, 

and these can evolve over time. Producing and accessing them requires new data manage-

ment systems and due consideration not only in extended scientific communities, but also 

in health and social systems.

Changing human capacities 

More and more technologies are available, and will become available, to change human na-

ture. These technologies stem from fields as different as pharmacology, robotics, information 

and communication technologies, genetics, neurosciences (e.g. ways to visualise thinking 

64 

 The  European  data  protection  supervisor  (Peter  Hustinx)  has  said  that  Intellectual  Property  is  important  
to  society  and  must  be  protected  (where  the  innovator  so  chooses  but  it  should  not  be  placed  above  
individuals’ rights to privacy and data protection. 
(http://www.macworld.co.uk/business/news/index.cfm?rss&newsid=28751).  Protection  could  include  open 
access agreements, where the innovator chooses to offer their work for open use, under defined conditions.

processes65), and perhaps in the future synthetic biology. They confront us with the question 
of what constitutes human nature, and in what way we should protect the integrity of our 

body. Furthermore, to what extent is it reasonable to change the biological and/or cognitive 

features and capacities of humans using the tools of technology, e.g. to influence life-span, 

overall health, or mental capacities. Values such as autonomy, authenticity, identity, integri-

ty and health are at stake, but they may well also clash with the moral principle of justice, 

identity and the value of equality. 

Public health

Public health in the sense of measures taken and technologies applied in order to improve 

the health of populations is high on the global agenda. Many measures are morally uncon-

tested ( quality of drinkable water etc), but there are more complicated themes, such as mor-

al views on participation in preventive measures (e.g. vaccinations), on the promotion of a 

healthy lifestyle, on diagnostic procedures in prevention programs. New technological de-

velopments in the area and societal changes are tightly interrelated and they have to be dis-

cussed in relation to the scarcity of resources for the provision of health care. This raises new 

issues: should the population at large be informed of the different costs and implications of 

political choices related to public health? How strong can recommendations to participate in 

preventive programs be? More and more drugs will be created for particular segments of the 

population and that could create ethical problems. Important values such as freedom, respon-

sibility for heath, responsibility for the health of others (e.g. pandemics), justice and wellbe-

ing, are at stake and need to be balanced.

Animal health and welfare in relation to the needs of research, agriculture, 
food industry

Europe has regulated a number of aspects under which animals are used in agriculture and 

especially for food, as well as for research. An opinion on animal cloning for food supply has 

already been formulated by the EGE, but more needs to be done now that genetically modi-

fied animals have started to be approved for food and production of pharmaceutical products. 

These developments might also be the object of ethical analysis. For the European Union, 

animal welfare is an important value. And yet, it needs to be contextualised and related to 

human rights and values of humans. Where to draw the line of ‘utilising’ animals for the 

well-being of humans must be ethically analysed in view of the emerging practices and new 

technologies. 

Food and agricultural techniques

There is an increasing demand for a sufficient amount of food (food security) worldwide, es-

pecially for populations without proper access to food. That might increase in the near fu-

ture. The demand is for a safe and healthy food supply. New technologies (including nano-

technology and genetic modification) help in transforming agricultural raw materials into 

either foodstuffs or industrial products such as bio-fuels or chemicals and in preserving 
them. New technologies will also have an impact on animal welfare (demand for more pro-

duction). They may make it economically feasible to produce alternative products to food-

stuffs. At the same time these demands might conflict, and might also lead to increased sus-

tainability problems in agriculture in the future.

IPR and open access

New ways to deal with technological innovations and scientific findings have been on the 

agenda of the Commission and of the Group in recent years. When the TRIPS Agreement 

was negotiated in 1994, the legal system to protect Intellectual Property (IP) had been de-

vised at a time when most inventions were in (mechanical) engineering and almost all copy-

right referred to the printed word. We are in a new age, when new technologies strain the 

systems to breaking point. The patent system works well with inventions that are easily and 

unambiguously described in writing; this includes most engineering or innovations in the 

chemical industry. It may be far more difficult to describe inventions that involve biology, 

with its inbuilt variability, or those which straddle interdisciplinary boundaries. Through-

out the history of the IP legal system there has been an (explicit) agreement that protection 

of the rights of the inventor should be balanced with the needs of society and the need to en-

sure continuing innovation. The mechanisms to ensure this have included a limited period 

of time for protection and a requirement to publish details of the invention so that it could 

be duplicated by those skilled in the art. There is now a general concern that the patent sys-

tem is being used in ways inimical to this compact — multiple patents and cross-licensing 

may exclude others from using the technologies, and inventors or users in developing coun-

tries are unable (often for reasons of cost or absence of infrastructure) to utilise new technol-

ogies effectively.

Copyright issues are also suddenly of significance in the debate about the rights of the in-

novator and the rights of society. The change is even greater than that in the area of patents. 

The published work, whether it be written, a work of art or music, photographs and video me-

dia, is no longer a discrete entity. The rights of those producing these works have to be bal-

anced with the rights of society as a whole. The rights of society to own and use material de-

veloped by others must be part of the compact.

COMMISSION

COMMISSION DECISION

of 11 May 2005

on the renewal of the mandate of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies

(Only the French text is authentic)

(2005/383/EC)

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Having regard to the Treaty
Community,

establishing the European

principles and guidelines (COM(2002) 713), states that
‘open calls may be particularly appropriate when dealing
with sensitive issues and when groups are liable to stand
for a reasonable period of time’.

Whereas:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

In November 1991, the European Commission decided
to incorporate ethics into the decision-making process
for Community research and technological development
policies by setting up the Group of Advisers on the
Ethical Implications of Biotechnology (GAEIB).

The Commission decided on 16 December 1997 to
replace the GAEIB by the European Group on Ethics in
(EGE) extending the
Science and New Technologies
Group’s mandate to cover all areas of the application
of science and technology.

The EGE’s mandate was renewed by the Commission
Decision of 26 March 2001 for a four-year period and
its remit was slightly modified to improve the Group’s
working methods.

The EGE requires new working methods in order to
respond to more rapid science and technology devel-
opments in a timely manner and requires new compe-
tences in order to address a greater range of science and
technology applications.

(6)

The current EGE remit comes to an end on 25 March
2005 and the following decision shall therefore replace
the
annexed to the Communication to the
Commission of 26 March 2001 (C(2001) 691),

remit

HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:

Article 1

The Commission hereby decides to renew the mandate of the
European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies
(EGE) for a four-year period.

Article 2

Mission

The task of the EGE shall be to advise the Commission on
ethical questions relating to sciences and new technologies,
either at the request of the Commission or on its own initiative.
The Parliament and the Council may draw the Commission’s
attention to questions which they consider to be of major
ethical
importance. The Commission shall, when seeking the
opinion of the EGE, set a time limit within which such an
opinion shall be given.

Article 3

Composition — Nomination — Appointment

(5)

The Communication from the Commission on the
collection and use of expert advice by the Commission:

The EGE members are appointed by the President of the

1.
Commission.

66 

 On 14 October 2009 the Commission adopted a Decision on the extension of the mandate of the European 
Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies and of the period of appointment of its members (2009/757/
EC), see http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:270:0018:0018:EN:PDF

12-month period involving around 12 working days a year.
Members are expected to attend a minimum of four meetings
a year.

— Each member of the EGE shall be appointed for a term of
four years. Such appointment may be renewable for a
maximum of two further terms.

For the purposes of preparing its opinions and within the

and technical information,

— may set up working groups to consider specific issues,

— The list of EGE members

it
shall include any dissenting point of view. Where there is an
operational requirement for advice to be given more quickly on
a particular subject, short statements will be produced, to be
followed if necessary by a fuller analysis, while ensuring that
transparency is
for any other opinion. EGE
opinions always refer to the state of the art of the technology
at the time the opinion is issued. The EGE may decide to update
opinions if it deems it necessary.

Annex I.d: Press releases on EGE Opinions

EGE Opinion N° 21 on the ethical aspects of nanomedicine (17 January 2007)

The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies adopted on 17 January 

2007 Opinion No 21 on the ethical aspects of nanomedicine and presented it today to Pres-

ident Barroso. 

Following the request made by President Barroso on 10 November 2005, the European Group 

on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) chaired by Swedish philosopher Göran 

Hermerén today handed the President its Opinion on the ethical aspects of nanomedicine. 

In finalising its work the EGE received inputs from a number of hearings with experts in 

the field, decision makers and relevant stakeholders, as well as a public round table that took 

place in Brussels, in March 2006. These meetings were organised by the Bureau of European 

Policy Advisers (BEPA), which acts as the Group’s Secretariat. 

The EGE is an independent, multidisciplinary and pluralist advisory group composed of 14 

members. Its role is to advise the European Commission on how ethical values should be 

taken into consideration in the preparation and implementation of Community legislation 

or policies. 

Nanomedicine and nanotechnology in the EU Research Programme 

Nanomedicine is an area of nanotechnology which raises high expectations with regard to 

its potentials in diagnostics, drug development and delivery, imaging and other health- relat-

ed applications. It is a major research sector covered by the EU Research and Development 

Programme. 

Under the 6th EU Framework Programme for research (FP6) the Commission has invested 
more than €1.36 Billion in nanotechnology (550 projects financed) and under the 7th Frame-
work Programme for research (FP7) some €3.5 billion should be allocated to this research 

sector. 

The first FP7 call for proposals on nanotechnology has been launched and it has been esti-

mated that €300-400 million could be allocated to nanotechnology in 2007. Around €100 

million per year is expected to be allocated to nanomedicine project proposals. 

Like other research sectors, however, this new area of nanotechnology needs a proper analy-

sis of its ethical implications. 

The EGE Opinion on the ethical aspects of nanomedicine. 

In its Opinion the EGE acknowledges that nanomedicine offers the possibility of new diag-

nostic, treatment and preventive methods that may open up promising areas of medicine. 

The Opinion focuses on ethics issues arising from nanomedicine but also discusses a num-

ber of problems raised by nanotechnology insofar as they concern primarily health-related 

issues. 

The EGE underlines the vital importance of addressing concern for safety with respect to 

nanomedical developments (and, in fact, nanotechnology in general) and therefore advocates 

the need to establish measures to verify the safety of nanomedical products and to ensure 

that nanomedical devices are properly assessed with regard to public health. The Group pro-

poses that institutions already operating at European and national level to protect the safety 

of patients and citizens should be charged with the additional task of overviewing the safe-

ty and security aspects of new tools and devices in nanomedicine. The Group then under-

lines the need to properly address risk assessment at national and EU level and invites rele-

vant stakeholders to devote adequate efforts to understanding and preventing risks that may 

be linked to nanomedicine. 

As far as public participation is concerned, the Group argues that transparency (including 

openness about uncertainties and knowledge gaps) is essential for public trust in nanotech-

nology. The Group therefore proposes that initiatives should be taken at national and Euro-

pean level to prepare surveys of public perception of the benefits and risks of the applications 

of nanotechnologies, with special reference to medical sectors. The Group also calls for ini-

tiatives to be taken to organise academic and public debates on problems and possibilities of 

present and near-future nanomedicine. 

Additionally the Group underlines the need for: prospective technology assessment, includ-
ing consideration of social effects (also in developing countries); interdisciplinary research 

on the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) of nanomedicine; the establishment of a 

European Network on Nanotechnology Ethics; and enhanced information exchange between 

research ethics committees in different Member States or among competent bodies in par-

ticular on toxicity studies, ELSI-related aspects of nanomedicine and informed consent pro-

cedures with regard to safety. 

As far as the legal implications of nanomedicine are concerned, the EGE does not propose 

any new regulatory structures specifically dealing with nanomedicine at this point, and ar-

gues that any changes should be made within existing structures (with focus on implemen-

tation of existing regulations). The Group proposes, however, that possible cases of nano-

medicine applications where there might be overlap between regulations, which could create 

uncertainty as to which regulations should be applied, should be explored by the relevant au-

thorities so that the existing regulations can be implemented in an unambiguous way. In ad-

dition the EGE calls for comparative research on intellectual property rights and nanomedi-

cine and advocate the needs to look further into the balance between knowledge protection 

and information dissemination.

EGE Opinion N° 22 on the recommendations on the ethical review of hESC FP7  
research projects (20 June 2007)

European Group on Ethics gives its opinion on the ethics review of projects using human 
embryonic stem cells funded from the 7th Research Framework Programme

The European Group on Ethics (EGE) has delivered its most recent opinion to Commission 

President Barroso, looking at the issues of ethics reviews of research projects using human 

embryonic stem cells -hESC. The opinion was based on the Council and Parliament Decision 

that sets up the programme. The EGE recognised the need to promote responsible research 

that is transparent, serves the public interest, respects Member States’ autonomy, preserves 

public trust, promotes international cooperation and requires the embedding of ethics with-

in research practice. The Group suggested that, among others, the following considerations 

have to apply to hESC funded by the EU: 1) FP7 hESC lines have to result from non-implant-
ed IVF embryos; 2) hESC lines banked in the European Registry should be used where pos-

sible; 3) If alternatives to hESC with the same scientific potential as embryo-derived stem 

cells will be found in the future, their use should be maximised; 4) Donors’ rights (in terms 

of health, informed consent, data protection and free donation) have to be protected and safe-

guarded; 5) actions to stimulate public debate on this research area are needed at EU level.

EGE Opinion N° 23 on the ethical aspects of animal cloning for food supply  
(16 January 2008)

European Group on Ethics adopts its Opinion nr. 23 on ethical aspects of animal cloning 

for food supply 

In February 2007, following the announcement by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 

concerning possible authorisation of food products derived from cloned cattle, pigs and goats on 

the market, President Barroso asked the European Group on Ethics of science and new technol-

ogies (EGE) to issue an Opinion on ethical implications of cloning animals for food supply. 

At the same time, the European Food and Safety Agency (EFSA), was asked to produce an 

Opinion on food safety, animal health, and environmental implications of live cloned ani-

mals obtained through somatic cell nuclear transfer technique (SCNT), their offspring and 

the products obtained from them. 

After several months of internal working meetings, expert hearings, a public consultation 

launched in the Europa web site (800 contributions received) and a round table with repre-

sentatives from academia, industry, NGOs, civil society, International organisations and in-
dustry67, on January 16, 2007, the EGE has adopted its latest Opinion on ethical aspects of 
animal cloning for food supply. The Group is aware of the EFSA draft Opinion and the FDA 

Report published the day before the adoption of the Opinion. 

Considering the current level of suffering and health problems of surrogate dams and animal 

clones, the EGE has doubts as to whether cloning animals for food supply is ethically justi-

fied. Whether this applies also to progeny is open to further scientific research. 

At present, the EGE does not see convincing arguments to justify the production of food from 
clones and their offspring68. If in the future food products derived from cloned animals were 
to be introduced to the European market, the EGE recommends that the following require-

ments are met: 

Food safety - The safety of food products for human consumption as a pre-condition for their 

marketing must be guaranteed and scientific updates and follow up research into progeny 

should be carried out. 

Animal welfare and health - In accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty (animals as sentient 

beings) and the Lisbon Treaty, additional requirements should be met in intensive animal 

breeding, with the aim of following the guidance on animal welfare provided by the World 

Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), e.g. the five freedoms: from hunger, thirst and malnu-

trition; from fear and distress; from physical and thermal discomfort; from pain, injury and 

disease; and to express normal patterns of behaviour. 

Traceability - Current EU legislation on food regarding traceability of animals and their food 

products should be enforced. It should be ensured that EU legislation provides for the ability 

to identify individual animals where necessary.

Global trade - The import of cloned animals, their offspring and materials derived from 

cloned animals (e.g. semen and food products) should be conditional on proper documenta-

tion, in particular with regard to traceability provisions and animal welfare. 

In addition the EGE recommends that: 

Animal welfare - Further studies and analyses on long-term animal welfare and health im-

plications for clones and their offspring, as well as more comparative analyses with other as-

sisted and traditional reproductive technologies in animal farming, should be carried out for 

a proper assessment of this issue, in line with EFSA draft opinion. The Commission should 

take initiatives to prepare a Code of Conduct on responsible farm animal breeding, includ-

ing animal cloning. 

Farm animal biodiversity and sustainability – The Commission should take proper mea-

sures to preserve the genetic heritage of farm animal species, for example by funding projects 

that aim to preserve domesticated breeds in Europe and to promote sustainable agriculture. 

Public participation - Public debates should be promoted on the impact of farm animal clon-

ing on agriculture and environment, on societal impact of increasing meat consumption and 

rearing of bovines, as well as on the fair distribution of food resources. The Commission 

should take a pro-active role in promoting public discussion on the use of animal cloning, 

and its potential implications, by financing a number of ad hoc initiatives aimed at promot-

ing public debate on the marketing of food products derived from animal cloning. 

Public perception - The Commission should launch a thematic Eurobarometer survey and 

qualitative studies on animal cloning for food supply, in order to collect indicators on pub-

lic perception concerning the introduction of such products to the food market as is being 

done in other countries. 

Labelling – The EGE is aware of the technical difficulties of labelling products from off-

spring, nevertheless it recommends that the Commission takes the initiative to devise tar-

geted procedures prior to the marketing of such food in the EU. 

Intellectual property issues – It should be clarified whether the exclusion clauses in Direc-

tive 98/44/EC (Art. 6d) on patentability of biological inventions and the EPO rules (23 d) to 

animal cloning for food apply. 

Global trade and consumer’s freedom – The EGE is aware that import issues of food products 

derived from cloned animals, including compliance with World Trade Organisations provi-
sions, may complicate the market situation, however, the EGE recommends that the Com-

mission takes initiatives to ensure consumers’ freedom and rights. 

Research - Further research is needed, in particular basic research on animal cloning, as well 

as impact on human health, animal welfare for farmed species other than those covered by 

EFSA. Similarly, further ethical, legal and social implications of animal cloning for food sup-

ply as well as qualitative studies on public perception should be carried out. 

The EGE Opinion has been issued to Commission President Barroso on 16.01.2008, the Opin-

ion is accessible at http://ec.europa.eu/european_group_ethics/index_en.htm

EGE Opinion N° 24 on the ethics of modern developments in agricultural  
technologies (17 December 2008)

The current revision of the EU Common Agriculture Policy, food security and safety, cli-

mate change and agricultural sustainability, global trade of agricultural commodities are all 

issues that have drawn the attention of media, policy makers and civil society in the last 

few years. According to the latest FAO report published early in December 2008, 963 mil-

lion people are suffering hunger in the world in 2008, 40 million people more than in 2007, 

as consequence of higher food prices. The ongoing financial and economic crisis could drive 

even more people into hunger and poverty. There is therefore a passionate debate on how to 

face these challenges and a high expectation exist that new technologies in agriculture may 

contribute to solve this problem.

In order to address the new challenges and opportunities which lie ahead for EU agriculture, 

President Barroso has asked the EGE to give its advice on the ethical implications of modern 

developments in agriculture technologies. The Group accepted this difficult task and decided 

to focus primarily on agriculture technologies and methods for primary production of food of 

plant origin. The Opinion was adopted on December 17, 2008, by unanimity. In this Opinion 

the EGE develops an ethical framework for modern developments in agriculture technologies.

According to the Opinion, the EGE is aware of the need of promoting innovation in agricul-

ture but it is equally aware that technologies alone cannot provide final solutions to the chal-

lenges modern agriculture is facing in the EU and worldwide. The Group however supports all 

technologies in agriculture insofar they are conducive to the goals and priorities indicated in 

this Opinion. The Group also emphasises the need for an integrated view and an integrated ap-

proach on agriculture technologies so that the production, storage and distribution processes 

are considered together when the implications of any new technology is assessed ethically.

The Group considers the goals of (1) food security, (2) food safety and (3) sustainability as first 

priorities and guiding principles to which any technology in agriculture must adhere. There-

fore the Group recommends an integrated approach in agriculture, based on a system where 

its constituent units are balanced, not just at a technical level (where there is a continuous 

assessment of the balance between required input, e.g. resources, energy etc., and expected 

outcomes to assure its goals) but also at an ethical level (where members of society interact 

and act on the basis of commonly held values).

The EGE calls for the explicit embedding of ethical principles in agriculture policy (whether 

traditional or innovative) and it argues that respect for human dignity and justice, two funda-

mental ethical principles, have to apply to production and distribution of food products too.

Using this ethical framework as a point of departure, the EGE in this opinion also makes rec-

ommendations on a plethora of issues, such as: revision of EU Common Agriculture Policy, 

technology impact assessment of agricultural technologies; the right to food; Sustainability 

of agriculture technologies; Food safety; Agricultural biodiversity; Soil and water protection; 

Biofuels; GM crops; Research in agricultural sciences; policy-making in arable agriculture; 

Global trade in agricultural products; Intellectual Property Rights system; Fair competition 
and “vertical monopolies”; Food prices; Societal aspects; Public participation; Responsibili-
ty of EU citizens; Food waste, etc.

The adopted Opinion is available at the EGE web site:

EGE Opinion N° 25 on the ethical aspects of synthetic biology (17 November 2009)

On May 28, 2008 President José Manuel Barroso asked the European Group on Ethics of sci-

ence and new technologies (EGE) to issue an Opinion on the ethical, legal and social impli-

cations raised by synthetic biology. The EGE adopted its Opinion on November 18, 2009.

What is synthetic biology?

Synthetic biology is a new research field within which scientists and engineers seek to mod-

ify existing organisms by designing and synthesising artificial genes or proteins, metabolic 

or developmental pathways and complete biological systems in order to understand the ba-

sic molecular mechanisms of biological organisms and to perform new and useful functions. 

Synthetic biology might have an impact on the following sectors: biofuels, antipollutants, tex-

tiles, cosmetics, diagnostic and therapeutic tools, vaccines, drugs food and feed ingredients.

In its Opinion the EGE uses a definition definition of synthetic biology that includes: 1) the 

design of minimal cells/organisms (including minimal genomes); 2) the identification and 

use of biological ‘parts’ (toolkit); and 3) the construction of totally or partially artificial bio-

logical systems.

Why synthetic biology should be addressed from an ethical perspective?

In its Opinion the EGE identifies and addresses ethical concerns particularly but not exclu-
sively from the point of view of safety and security. Beyond this, the ethical reflection ad-

dresses justice, governance, science and society dialogue, intellectual property and concepts 

of life. As for other new technologies, synthetic biology must respect the international frame-

work on ethics and human rights and in particular the respect for human dignity, which is 

conceived as not only a fundamental right in itself but ‘the real basis of fundamental rights’. 

Other ethics principles that have to also be taken into account include, inter alia, the princi-

ples of safety; sustainability, justice, precaution, freedom of research and proportionality.

The EGE Opinion:

In its Opinion the EGE proposes a number of specific recommendations on synthetic  biology, 

namely, inter alia:

Safety

The EGE advocates that any use of synthetic biology products should be conditional on meeting 

safety requirements identified in the Opinion as needing further elaboration. The EGE recom-

mends among other things that the EC initiates a survey on relevant risk assessment procedures 

in the EU and identify possible gaps in the current regulations and how identified gaps are to be 

filled; and that a Code of Conduct for research in synthetic biology should be prepared by the EC.

Environmental applications

The EGE recommends among other things that before an organism, fabricated or modified 

via synthetic biology, is released into the environment, ecological long term impact assess-
ment must be carried out. The results of the study should be evaluated taking into account 
the precautionary principle and EU legislation on the deliberate release into the environment 

of genetically modified organisms (2001/18/EC).

Energy and sustainable chemical industry

The Group proposes that the use of synthetic biology for alternative energy supply in EU Mem-

ber States would be complementary to the EU renewable energy plan. The EGE also advocates 

that the protection of consumers’ rights is a key factor. The EGE therefore stresses that labelling 

of specific synthetic biology products, such as cosmetics and textiles, should be explored.

Biomedicine and biopharmaceutical applications

The EGE recommends that further to the application of scientific and legal frameworks, spe-

cific ethics considerations have also to be addressed by the competent Authorities (such as 

EMEA) when drugs and medical products will result from synthetic biology protocols.

Biosecurity, prevention of bioterrorism and dual use

New tools may be derived from synthetic biology for the military sector such as biomateri-

als or bioweapons. Ethical analysis must assess the goal of security in relation to transparen-

cy. In addition, the EGE recommends control mechanisms such as licensing and registering 

of tools in order to prevent terrorist uses of synthetic biology. The Group also recommends 

that the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of 
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction should incorporate 

provisions on the limitation or prohibition of research in synthetic biology.

Governance

The existing fragmented regulatory framework may not be sufficient, and the EGE urges the 

EC to propose and put in place a robust framework for synthetic biology, identifying the rel-

evant stakeholders and indicating their responsibilities. The EGE proposes that the EU takes 

up the question of governance of synthetic biology in relevant global fora.

Patenting and common heritage

The EGE proposes that debates on the most appropriate ways to ensure the public access 

to the results of synthetic biology is launched. The EGE stresses that general ethical issues 

raised by patent applications have to be addressed properly in the patent allocation system. 

The EU legal patent system defines the EGE as the body to assess ethical implications relat-

ed to patents. The EGE urges the European Patent Organisation and national patent offices to 

take account of Article 7 in the EU patent directive 98/44 and implement this article.

Trade and global justice

The EGE recommends that when synthetic biology is discussed at international level, in-

cluding the WTO, the ethical issues associated to the technology should be addressed. This 

should be taken into account in the Doha round negotiations. The EGE urges that EU Bio-

safety standards for synthetic biology products are adopted as minimal standards for EU im-

port-export of synthetic biology products.

Science and society dialogue

The Group asks the EU and EU Member States to take actions to promote public debates and 

engagement amongst the stakeholders in order to identify main societal concerns in the dif-

ferent areas covered by synthetic biology.

Research

The Group invites the Commission to support basic research in the fields of biology, chemistry, 

energy, materials science, and engineering, as well as applied and interdisciplinary research, as 

identified in this Opinion. This should be reflected in the R&D EU research Framework Pro-

grammes budget. The Group notes that synthetic biology could lead, in the future, to a para-

digm shift in understanding concepts of life. It therefore calls on the Commission to initiate an 

open intercultural forum to address the issues, to include philosophical and religious input.

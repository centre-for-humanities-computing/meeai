Several  procedures,  collectively  called  Prenatal  Diagnosis  (PND),  can  be
performed to assess specific or general aspects of the development and health of
the embryo or fetus.  This Opinion deals with PND which allows the examination
of  pregnancies  at  high  risk  of  fetal  anomaly  or  genetic  disease  to  rule  out  or
confirm  the  presence  of  such  an  anomaly  or  disease  using  invasive  techniques:
amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling or fetal blood sampling.

This  Opinion  does  not  deal  with  prenatal  screening,  neither  preconceptional
testing  or  screening,  nor  preimplantation  diagnosis.  These  techniques  introduce
additional ethical issues which would require separate consideration.

Prenatal  screening  consists  in  the  extended  application  of  risk  assessment
procedures to populations of pregnant women rather than to individuals. Prenatal
screening raises additional ethical issues, namely in terms of public health policy.

Preconceptional  testing  or  screening  allows  individuals  to  be  aware  of  specific
genetic risks to their offspring. It could involve the development of simple-to-use
genetic  testing  kits,  which  raise  ethical  issues  regarding  the  management  of
information by the individuals.

Preimplantation diagnosis (PID) consists of analysing the genetic  components  of
very  early  embryos(cid:3) LQ(cid:3) YLWUR.  This  allows  the  transfer  of  embryos  of  a  particular
sex or  genotype  to  the  woman’s  uterus,  thereby  greatly  reducing  the  need  to
consider termination of pregnancy for couples at high risk of  transmitting genetic
diseases.  PID  is  currently  at  the  experimental  stage  of  clinical  trials.  Compared
with  PND,  PID,  which  requires(cid:3) LQ(cid:3) YLWUR  fertilization  raises  additional  ethical
questions(cid:3)which the Group intends to study in a later stage.

1.3

Ultrasound  examination  is  now  a  feature  of  routine  antenatal  care,  in  particular
aiding  obstetric  management.  (Many  couples  also  gain  much  pleasure  from  the
direct image of their developing baby that the scan provides).

Routine  ultrasound  is  not  a  precise  diagnostic  procedure  and  is  very  operator
dependent.  It(cid:3) may(cid:3) Uesult  in  an  image  that  is  a  cause  for  concern  about  the
development  of  the  fetus  (usually  related  to  dating  of  the  pregnancy).  Further
ultrasound  tests  may  be  needed,  which  can  be  very  precise,  in  order  to  try  and
discover the true situation. The management of these anxiety-provoking situations
and  the  extent  to  which  women  should  be  forewarned  about  this  possibility  are
just two  of  the  ethical  issues  raised  by  the  widespread  use  of  ultrasound.  The
scale, complexity  and  importance  of  these  issues  demands  detailed  analysis.
However, this  area  falls  outside  the  field  of  biotechnology  and  therefore  outside
the mandate of the GAEIB.

1.4

The  use  of  minimally  invasive  techniques  such  as  maternal  blood  sampling  or
cervical canal flushing to attempt identification and genetic analysis of cells that
have naturally leaked from the fetus, are still in an early experimental stage.

1.5

PND,  as  a  medical  service,  provides  information  to  women,  couples  and
clinicians. PND  can  be  used  by  couples  at  high  risk  of  genetic  disease  in  their
offspring, to establish enough confidence to start a pregnancy they would not have
risked without  these  procedures,  and  thereby  increase their  prospects  for  healthy
children.  It  also  allows  them  to  go  on  with  a  pregnancy  they  would  have
terminated  in  the  absence  of  information  on  the  genetic  condition  of  the  fetus
through PND.

1.6a

PND  raises  ethical  concerns  such  as  safety  concerns,  namely  related  to  the
induction of miscarriage.

It also raises concerns linked to the decision concerning continuation of pregnancy
or not, if a genetic anomaly is diagnosed;

Other ethical issues are raised by the risk of misuse of the technique (possibility of
eugenic  practices  linked  to  the  selection  of  sex  or  other  characteristics  for  non-
medical  reasons),  and  by    the  risk  of  disclosure  and  misuse  of  the  genetic
information;

1.6b Moreover it could be feared that economic factors lead to pressure for a wider use

of PND;

1.7

1.8

1.10

1.11

Concerns are also expressed that a (wider) use of these technologies could lead to
a  reduction  in  social  spending  on  facilities  and  assistance  for  people  with
disabilities.  Moreover,  PND  is  regarded  by  some  people  as  giving  rise  to
stigmatization and discrimination against certain forms of disability.

The  availability  of  PND  tends  to  transform  the  perception  of  pregnancy  by
increasing  the  range  of  options,  the  amount  of  information  potentially  available,
and the decisions that the woman or couple are called upon to make. This, in turn,
increases(cid:3)their responsibility(cid:3)as well as that of the professionals involved(cid:17)

The  development  of  PND  underlines  the  importance  of  the  woman  or  couple’s
autonomy(cid:3)and responsibility in two ways. First, they are faced with the option of
requesting or not requesting the test.

Second, they may be faced in practice with a difficult choice, namely whether to
continue or terminate the pregnancy, in the light of available treatment;

The woman or couple’s choice will in practice be conditioned by the actual access
to PND services, by the existence of and access to therapy, to medical and social
services for the good care of persons with disabilities, as well as for termination of
pregnancy.  It  could  even  be  influenced  by  the  threat  of  potential  civil  liability
action by their child after the birth.

The option chosen depends also on the availability and the quality of a network of
genetic  counselling  services  and  opportunities,  which  can  provide  answers  to
the problems of personal, social, financial and legal consequences;

PND raises specific issues concerning the confidentiality of genetic data and their
communication  to  relatives  for  whom  they  can  be  of  interest  by  making  them
aware of a potential risk of genetic disease for themselves or their offspring;

The establishment of registers of genetic data for  follow-up  purposes  also  raises
specific issues concerning confidentiality.

2.1.

The on-going ethical debate, the scientific progress which is rapidly enlarging the
medical  scope  of  PND,  the  variability  of  many  genetic  diseases  and  fetal
anomalies  in  their  expression,  severity  or  prognosis  render  inappropriate  the
listing of illnesses or handicaps that qualify for PND.

A  framework,  based  on  general  ethical  principles,  is  preferable  to  determine
which  PND  and  associated  genetic  counselling  will  be  offered  to  women  and
couples.  In this  context,  a  "case-by-case"  approach  would  have  the  advantage  of
minimizing reference  explicitly  to  a  model  of  normality,  which  would  lead  to
stigmatization.

2.2

The  use  of  PND  must  rely  on  the  free  and  informed  consent  of  the  woman  or
couple concerned. No prenatal genetic testing must be imposed by law, by public
health  services  or  by  any  other  institution  or  person.  Tests  should  be  done  only
at the request of the woman or couple after they have been fully informed, namely
by genetic counselling.

All  should  have  equal  access  to  the  PND  services  available  and  the  associated
genetic counselling.  Access  to  the  test  should  not  be  influenced  by  the  potential
decision  of  the  woman(cid:3) or  couple  in  the  case  of  an  unfavorable  result.  Resort  to
PND should not be considered as a condition for access to any kind of service or
benefit

2.3

Careful  genetic  counselling,  both  before  and  after  the  test,  and  disclosure  of  the
result of a PND to the woman or couple concerned are an integral part of PND and
should not be separated from sampling and testing.

The  offer  and  use  of  PND  presuppose  good  quality  social  and  medical  services,
especially  adequately  trained  staff,  suitable  equipment  and  reliability  of  the
techniques.  Safeguards  against  unethical  or  unprofessional  practices  must  be  in
place  for  all  centres  offering  these  procedures.  These  centres(cid:3) must  be  officially
recognized.

Because the consequences  of  the  information  can  be  of    the  greatest  importance
to all  concerned,  it  is  an  ethical  imperative  that  counselling,  which  requires  a
specific competence, should be of good quality and widely available. This implies
that  there  must  be  sufficient  trained  medical,  nursing  and  other  professionals  to
provide one-to-one counselling when PND is performed.

In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, the European Union should strie to
achieve a high and comparable level of quality of the training of the professionals,
namely  concerning  the  genetic  counselling,  and  of  the  services  provided  in
different Member States.

2.4 

2.5

Although  the  techniques  of  PND  can  be  expected  to  become  less  invasive  and
easier  to  perform,  for  example,  by  maternal  blood  analysis,  the  decisions  the
woman  or  the  couple  have  to  make  will  remain  just  as  difficult.  It  will  become
increasingly  important  to  ensure  that  genetic  counselling  is  not  separated  from
testing. For these reasons, and the fact that termination of pregnancy can be one
outcome, PND should always be performed in a medical context, no matter how
simple the testing procedure is.

The principle of free and informed consent implies that the genetic counselling to
the  woman  or  the  couple  must  be  non-directive,  professional  and  respectful  of
their autonomy. The decision to terminate the pregnancy or to give birth to a child
with a disease or a disability is a very difficult one. The interest of the individuals
concerned should take precedence over any collective benefit to society.

2.6

The  final  choice  of  whether  to  continue  or  to  terminate  the  pregnancy  is  the
prerogative of  the woman or the couple alone. No discrimination should be made
as  a  consequence  of  either  of  these  decisions.  Moreover,  the  woman  or  couple
should not be later penalised for the choice they have made.

Good  medical  and  social  conditions  must  be  ensured,  when  the  pregnancy  is
continued, for people with disabilities, members of the family or people caring for
the disabled person, avoiding any exclusion or discrimination against them. Good
medical, social and psychological conditions should also be guaranteed, when the
pregnancy is terminated.

2.7

2.8

PND should always be considered as a medical act and be offered on the basis of
specific  medical  indications.  The  choice  of  sex  or  other  characteristics  for  non-
medical  reasons  is  an  ethically  unacceptable  indication  for  PND  and  should  be
prohibited.

Confidentiality  of  the  results  of  the  test  is  an  ethical  imperative.  Genetic  data
should not be released, except with the(cid:3)free and informed consent of the woman or
couple. If the  genetic  data  are  relevant to  the  interests  of  other  family  members,
the woman or couple should be strongly recommended by the genetic counsellor
to allow the release of such data to these family members.

In  this  context,  the  processing  of  genetic  data  (including  its  collection,
compilation, conservation,  circulation  and  communication)  should  be  subject  to
appropriate protection measures within the framework established by the directive
on  data  protection.  However,  the  specificity  of  the  genetic  information  requires
particular  measures  of  protection  because  it  may  also  concern  members  of  the
family.

2.9

Public information and education have to be promoted so that the public gains an
objective and correct picture of the possibilities and limitations of PND.

In  accordance  with  its  mandate,  the  Group  of  Advisers    on  the  Ethical  Implications  of
Biotechnology submits this Opinion to the European Commission.

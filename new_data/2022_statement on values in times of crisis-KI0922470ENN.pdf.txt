Values  play  an  important  role  in  how  we  understand,  make  sense  of,  and  tackle  crises.  In  its  Statement,  the  EGE  points  to  the 
importance  of  solidarity  being  at  the  core  of  crisis  management;  it  shows  how  individual  and  collective  rights  and  interests  are 
intertwined; it outlines how values should direct the prioritisation of scarce resources; and it highlights the importance of good data 
as well as good communication.

Values influence how we frame the problems that 
strategic crisis management is supposed to address, 
and how we choose the instruments for that. 

What is important and why ?  
Who needs (special) protection and help ? 
Who is included ? Who is left out ? Etc. 

AMONG OTHER VALUES, 
SOLIDARITY IS AT THE CORE 
OF GOOD CRISIS MANAGEMENT.

But when leaders appeal to solidarity during a crisis, 
too often they do so in a tokenistic way, for instance, 
to  demand  from  people  that  they  comply  with 
measures or accept hardship. This can do more harm 
than good, especially when governments themselves are seen to 
act in ways that are detrimental to solidarity.

•  Solidarity  should  be  a  guiding  principle  for  strategic  crisis 
management and solidaristic institutions should be strengthened 
at all levels. 
•  Human dignity and solidarity should guide the allocation of scarce 
resources, also to avoid undue discrimination and to ensure special 
consideration of disadvantaged people.
•  Governments  have  a  duty  to  combat  poverty  and  inequities, 
multipliers of the impact of crises. 
•  Policy makers and the media should apply resilience thinking at 
the systemic (and not at the individual) level, as problems need 
structural solutions.
•  Policy makers and funders should strengthen the infrastructure 
for  data  sharing  for  crisis  management  and  containment,  with 
adequate protections in place.
•  The  effectiveness  of  measures  depends  significantly  on  good 
communication, which is also critical to building trust.
•  The  values  upon  which  the  decisions  and  recommendations  of 
government agencies are based must be made clear and be open 
to public scrutiny and appeal.

The  European  Group  on  Ethics  in  Science  and  New  Technologies  (EGE)  is  the 
independent  body  appointed  by  the  President  of  the  European  Commission  that 
advises  on  all  aspects  of  Commission  policies  and  legislation  where  ethical,  societal

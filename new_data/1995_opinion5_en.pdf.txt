modifications have been made to varieties of plants and farm animals in the crop
and  stockbreeding  sectors  for  centuries,  using  conventional  methods  such  as
selection,  crossbreeding  and  hybridization. 
the  modern
biotechnological  methods  now  being  developed  is  to  improve  further  certain
characteristics  of  plants,  animals  and  microorganisms  by  introducing  into  the
genome a modified or unmodified copy of a gene either  from the  same, or from
another species.  These biotechnological methods differ from traditional breeding
methods in that the new features of the products are clearly defined and because
genetic  information  (DNA)  can  be  transferred  across  species  and  even  kingdom
boundaries;

  The  object  of 

these  new  methods  are  intended  to  improve  agriculture  and  food  production  so
that plants for instance are more resistant to disease, harsh weather conditions or
other  effects  of  the  environment;  so  that  the  performance  and  health  of  farm
animals  is  enhanced  without  harming  their  welfare;  and  so  that  the  quality  and
safety  of  farm  products  including  their  shelf  life,  nutritional  value  and  purity  is
improved;

they can moreover enlarge choice for the consumers, who thereby can gain access
to new products with particular properties (modified tomatoes which keep longer,
for example); benefit to  the  environment (they could reduce the  use of chemical
fertiliser)  and  enhance  substainability  of  agricultural  systems  in  less  and  more
developed countries.

These  biotechnological  applications  relate  to  the  development  of  the  health  and
agri-foodstuffs sectors of the EU as specified in the White Paper (1993) Growth,
Competitiveness,  Employment  The  Challenges  and  Ways  Forward  into  the  21st
Century;

the  primary  ethical  imperative  applying  to  foodstuffs  that  enter  the  food  chain  -
whether or not they are derived from biotechnology - relates to their safety, which
has to be strictly monitored. When such products are authorized to  be placed on
the  market  they  will  have  already  met  the  required  safety  standards  both  for
human health and for the environment; these standards, which are also subject to
ethical  considerations,  do  not  fall  within  the  scope  of  this  opinion.  The
Commission’s  referral  for  an  Opinion  has  directed  the  Group’s  attention  to  the
ethical  dimension of labelling, to the consumer’s right  to  know  as  well  as  to  the
scope of the duty to provide adequate information about food derived from the use
of modern biotechnology;

there  are  various  cases  to  be  distinguished  in  relation  to  foods  derived  from
modern biotechnology: these include products (e.g. fruit and vegetables) in which
the  modified  DNA  remains  intact;  products  (e.g.  tinned  food,  meat,  fruit  and
vegetables) in which the DNA is  broken  down  by processing; products prepared
using  processing  aids  modified  by  biotechnology  (e.g.  enzymes);  other  products
coming  from  a  genetically  modified  source  that  are  themselves  unmodified  (e.g.
sugar from modified beet);

the original gene has to be replicated  LQ(cid:3) YLWUR  many  times  before  it  can  be  used.
This entails dilution of the original DNA in a ratio comparable to a drop of water
within  all  oceans,  so  that  any  DNA  in  the  product  can  be  regarded  as  a  copy
produced LQ(cid:3)YLWUR; in other cases the original DNA is not used  at all,  but  similar
DNA is synthesised artificially;

the  consumer’s  rights,  which  are  recognized  in  all  the  Member  States  as  stated
above, include a right to information and its corollary, a duty to inform, the scope
and  limits  of  which  are  laid  down  in  law.  In  this  respect,  transparency  between
producers,  retailers  and  consumers,  as  well  as  enforceability,  is  another
consideration of great importance, to maintain public confidence in the safety and
quality of products entering the food chain;

labelling  with  respect  to  consumer  information  is  therefore  important,  to  give
consumers  the  opportunity  to  make  an  informed  choice,  and  for  the  free
movement of products in the European Union;

WKH(cid:3)*URXS(cid:3)VXEPLWV(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)IROORZLQJ(cid:3)RSLQLRQ(cid:3)WR(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)(XURSHDQ(cid:3)&RPPLVVLRQ(cid:29)

the attainment of a high level of consumer protection is a crucial objective of the
Community  and  an  ethical  imperative  with  respect  to  food  whether  or  not  it  is
derived  from  the  use  of  biotechnology;  it  is  necessary  to  guarantee,  once  safety
has  been  ensured,  that  the  right  of  the  consumer  to  adequate  information  is
safeguarded;

biotechnological  progress  is  a  new  element  that  can  contribute  towards  meeting
food  requirements  in  Europe  and  throughout  the  world  which  corresponds  to  an
important objective for all members of human society; modern biotechnology, as
a technique,  used  in  food  production,  can  not  be  regarded  in  itself  as  ethical  or
non ethical;  the  provision  of  appropriate  and  understandable  information  for
consumers  about  food  derived  from  the  use  of  modern  biotechnology  should  go
hand-in-hand with the development of these technologies;

2.3

the consumers must be provided with information which, for transparency, should
be :

useful, adequate and informative;

clear, understandable, non technical;

honest,  not  misleading  or  confusing,  and  which  aims  to  prevent

-

-

-
fraud;

-

enforceable, i.e. possible to verify;

2.4

2.5

given the need to provide this information for the consumers and to lead to better
understanding  of  the  technological  developments  of  our  time,  their  benefits  as
well  as  their  limits,  labelling  will  be  appropriate  when  modern  biotechnology
causes a substantial change in composition, nutritional value or the use for which
the  food  is  intended,  not  only  the  new  food  composition  and  characteristics  but
also, in this specific case, for the process; modern biotechnology, however, does
not necessarily substantially change the composition and characteristics of foods;
in this case, it is not appropriate to indicate the nature of the process.

consumers have a right to be able to make informed choices about what they eat;
so  they  can  legitimately  expect  to  be  able  to  receive  a  clear  indication  of  where
additional  information  can  be  obtained,  especially  when  their  choices  include
cultural and religious considerations;

2.6

2.7

state-of-the-art  educational  and  information  networks  provide  mechanisms  by
which  producers  and/or  retailers  can  give  individual  consumers,  consumer
organisations, religious and special interest groups the material they need to reach
informed judgements about  food derived from the use of modern biotechnology.
The  Group  recommend  that  such  mechanisms  which  are  complementary  to
labelling should be developed (e.g. access to informatic databases, free telephone
help lines, information networks, ...);

it  is  of  vital  importance  that  public  information  and  education  are  promoted  as
well as  technology  assessment  so  that  the  public  gains  an  objective  and  correct
picture  of  foods  derived  from  the  use  of  modern  biotechnology;  they  must  be
aware  of  the  possibilities  and  limitations  that  exist  in  the  production  of  food  by
this means. Appreciation of the improvement of food quality, safety and value that
could  accrue  from  the  use  of  these  new  technologies  requires  a  didactic  as  well
as a democratic approach involving a close participation of European citizens;

2.8

in  this  respect,  the  Group  recommends  that  the  Commission  fosters  educational
programmes  at  all  levels  which  fall  in  the  line  of  Community  competence
according to the Treaty.

In  accordance  with  its  terms  of  reference,  the  Group  of  Advisers  on  the  Ethical
Implications of Biotechnology hereby presents this Opinion to the European Commission.

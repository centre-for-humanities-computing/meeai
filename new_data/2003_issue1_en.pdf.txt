Editorial 
by  Christiane  Bardoux,  Secretary  of  the  European  Group  on  Ethics  in  Science
and Technologies to the European Commission

The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies to the
European Commission has just published its Opinion on “The ethical aspects
of clinical research in developing countries”.

The German National Ethics Council will publish its Opinion on “Genetic
diagnosis prior to and during pregnancy (PGD/PND)” early 2003.
The  German  National  Ethics  Commission  and  the  French  Consultative  Ethics
Committee  intend  to  present  a  joint  Opinion  on  “Collection  and  storage  of
biological data and materials (biobanks)”.

The Australian Health Ethics Committee (AHEC) will hold in April 2003 a
national conference on “Ethics in human research”.

The most important subjects on the Austria Bioethics Commission´s agenda
are: Reproductive Medicine; the Austrian Act for Reproductive Medicine
and human embryonic stem cells research; Ethical problems of selected
fields of genetic testing.

La Commission de l’éthique de la science et de la technologie, Quebec (Canada)
a deux comités deux travail actuellement à l’oeuvre sur “Les enjeux éthiques
des banques de données génétiques” et “Les enjeux éthiques des
organismes génétiquement modifiés (OGM)”.

The  Nordic  Committee  on  Bioethics  has  planned  a  workshop  for  2003  on
bioethics teaching methods and a symposium on biotechnology and law.

The Hellenic National Bioethics Commission  is currently discussing the issue of
patents in biotechnology and a recommendation on this issue is expected by
March 2003.

The Norwegian model
The three independent but coordinated national committees for research ethics
cover all scientific disciplines.

The last mandate of the Portuguese National Council of Ethics for the Life
Sciences expired some months ago. The new President and new members have
not been appointed yet.

The Nuffield Council on Bioethics will publish a report in the autumn of 2003 on
the ethical issues of Pharmacogenetics.   A Workshop on end-of-life issues is
planned for early 2003.

The Belgian Advisory Committee on Bioethics draws up an annual report
containing its opinions, a list of the pending requests for advice and a survey of
activities of the local ethical committees of hospitals and universities.

EDITORIAL

Since  the  creation  of  the  first  national  ethics  committee  in  France  in  1993,
many  national  instances  have  been  set  up.    Even  if  these  committees  may
differ  in  their  composition  or  working  methods,  they  are  all  independant
bodies and have a consultative role in advising decision-makers.

The  issues  addressed  by  these  instances  reflect  the  questions  and  concerns
largely shared by all European and non-European citizens.  Therefore, it may
be  beneficial  for  all  to  share  experience  and  exchange  information  on  the
work already carried out on specific issues.

The  objective  of  this  newsletter,  initiated  by  the  secretariat  of  the  European
Group on Ethics, is to facilitate these exchanges.

We  are  grateful  to  all  those  who  have  contributed  to  this  first  issue  of  the
newsletter  and  we  welcome  comments,  suggestions,  or  additional
contributions from any interested committee in the next issue.

I hope that this initiative will be seen as a useful tool for all persons involved
in the ethical debate.

EGE Activities in 2002

Traditionally,  every  semester,  the  Group
visits  the  country  assuming  the  Presidency
of  the  EU 
in  order  to  meet  national
instances, and representatives of parliament
or  government 
in  the  ethical
involved 
debate.

Under  the  Spanish  Presidency,  on  April
18th  and  19th  2002,  the  Group  held  in
Barcelona  a  working  meeting  and  met
Members  of  the  Spanish  Parliament  and  of
Spanish  working  groups  on  Bioethics.  The

2

Group  also  took  part 
in  the  Platform
"European  African  partnership  on  clinical
trials program for poverty related diseases". 

Under  the  Danish  Presidency,  on  October
24th  and  25th,  2002,  the  Group  held  a
working  meeting  in  Copenhagen  and  met
members  of  the  Danish  Consumer  Agency
and  of  the  National  Ethics  Committee.  The
Group  also  had  a  debate  with  researchers
within  the  area  of  developing  countries  and
took part in the Conference on "Future Food
on Bioethics". 

Opinion published in 2002

Opinion  n°  16  Ethical  aspects  of  patenting
inventions 
involving  human  stem  cells
(07/05/2002)

In accordance with the 1998 EU Directive on
the  Legal  Protection  of  Biotechnological
Inventions  and  in  particular  its  article  7,
President Prodi requested the EGE to submit
an opinion aiming at defining the  conditions
and the limits of patenting of stem cells, not
only in relation to ethical considerations, but
also  in  the  relevant  processes  securing
ethical evaluations.

The  opinion  seeks  to  address  the  basic
ethical dilemmas arising due to the fact that
patents  can  encourage  scientific  progress
which  can  be  used  to  the  benefit  of  better
healthcare  and,  at  the  same  time,  can  also
impair access to the health care due to fees
that  will  have  to  be  paid  to  the  patent
holder. The EGE considers that the recourse
to compulsory licence should be encouraged
when the access to diagnostic and treatment
is  blocked  by  misuse  of  patent  rights  and
stresses  the  fact  that  it  is  the  responsibility
of the States to establish legal procedure for
the  delivery  of  compulsory  licence  and  to
examine  if  fair  access  to  health  care  justify
such a procedure. 

It  is  then  necessary  to  secure  the  right
balance between the inventors interests and
society’s  interests,  in  the  sense  that  one
task  for  the  community  is  to  secure  ethical
principles  and  values  in  the  context  of
possible conflicting interests of stakeholders,
namely:  patients  and  patient  associations,
inventors,  and  other  researchers,  donors,
industry, 
inventors,  healthcare  providers
and social insurance. 

specific 

The  Group  considers  that  only  human  stem
cells  lines  which  have  been  modified  by  an
inventive  process  to  get  new  characteristics
for 
industrial  application  are
patentable.  However,  that  stem  cell  which
are  been  isolated  and  cultured  but  which
have  not  been  modified  should  not  be
considers as patentable inventions.

Concerning  cloning  techniques  aiming  at
obtaining  human  embryonic  stem  cells  for
therapeutic  purposes,  the  Group  calls  for  a
cautious  approach  taking  into  account  the
excluding such invention from patentability.

The  EGE  finds  important  that  patents  on
stem  cells  enables  further  research.  In  this
sense the EGE calls for the creation of an EU
Registry  of  unmodified  human  stem  cell
lines.  The  Registry  should  include  both
embryonic  stem  and  embryonic  germ  cells
lines.  Such  a  Registry  would  ensure
transparency  and  facilitate  access  by  the
research community.

“Therefore, 
involving
human  subjects  cannot  exclusively  be
assimilated  to  an  economic  activity  subject
to  market  rules.  Health  should  be  regarded
as a public good rather than a commodity.” 

The general approach chosen in this Opinion

is  that  “the 
applied  to  clinical  trials  in  industrialised
countries  are  to  be  applicable  everywhere”,
namely :

the  principles  of  non-

the  principle  of  individual  autonomy,
entailing the giving of free and informed
consent  by  each  individual  involved  in  a
trial,
the  principle  of  justice  and  the  principle
of  beneficence  and  non-maleficence,
namely  with  regard  to  the  improvement
and protection of health,
the  principle  of  proportionality,  between
methods and aims of research.

(cid:2)  The  Group  stresses  that  clinical  research
should  only  be  carried  out  in  developing
countries  with  good  justification;  when
the  research  has  a  specific  interest  and
complies  with  the  health  priorities  of  the
host  country  and  not  for  reasons  of  pure
convenience. 

(cid:2)  The  Group  underlined  the  importance  of

of  local  scientists  from  the  host  country

that  “Where  it  is  not  possible  to  involve

should be implemented in the country”.

Concerning  the  use  of  placebo  in

Opinions in preparation

The Group will address in 2003 the question
of  Genetic  Testing  in  the  work  place
which  raises  not  only  ethical  issues  related
to genetic testing and predictive medicine in
general but also ethical issues related to the
principle of justice and non-discrimination in
access  to  work.  This  issue  has  a  particular
European  dimension  as  workers  can  freely
cross borderlines within the EU.

Then,  the  Group  plans  to  have  a  reflection
on  the  Ethical  aspects  on  Cord  Blood
Banks.  Indeed,  the  development  of  private
banks  as  well  as  their  publicity  on  the  web
raises  concerns  and  it  is  at  the  request  of
the  Commission  that  the  EGE  will  submit
this opinion.

The German 
National Ethics Council

Following the German Federal Government’s
decision of 2 May 2001 the National Ethics
Council was established on 8 June 2001 as a
national forum for dialogue about ethical
issues in the life sciences. It provides an
umbrella for interdisciplinary discourse relating
to science, medicine, theology, philosophy and
the social and legal sciences, expressing its
views on both the ethical aspects of new
developments in the life sciences and their
impact on individuals and society as a whole.
The National Ethics Council consists of up to
25 Members who represent the fields of
science, medicine, theology, philosophy,
society, law, ecology and economy, and are
appointed by the Federal Chancellor for a
period of four years. The Members generally
convene once a month in Berlin.

The National Ethics Council is an independent
body, bound only by its purpose as stipulated
in the Government decision that established it.
It determines the scope and organisation of its
work independently.
The Ethics Council puts great emphasis on its
work with the community and makes its
opinions, recommendations and reports public.

The National Ethics Council cooperates with
other ethics bodies in Germany as well as with
comparable institutions of other countries and
international organisations.

The General Secretariat of the National Ethics
Council is located on the premises of the Berlin
Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and
Humanities. The Council and its General
Secretariat are funded by the German Federal
Government.

The import of human embryonic stem
cells

Following intensive debate the National Ethics
Council published its Opinion on the import of
human embryonic stem cells for research
purposes on 20 December 2001.

In conclusion, the comprehensive document
offers the following options:

A  The temporary import of pluripotent human
stem cells is deemed ethically acceptable
under strict conditions (described in detail

5

in the Opinion), as the production of
such stem cells using surplus embryos
is held to be ethically permissible.
Therefore, the production of such stem
cells using surplus embryos within
Germany would also be acceptable. The
import conditions mentioned would
have to apply in equal measure to both
publicly and privately funded research.

B  The Council advocates the provisional

and temporary import of human
embryonic stem cells under strict
conditions as described in the Opinion.
All conditions shall apply in equal
measure to both publicly and privately
funded research, and must be met prior
to import.

C  A provisional ban (moratorium) should
be imposed on stem cell import. The
legislator must arrive at an explicit
decision on imports, yet not before
clarifying a number of issues,
individually listed in the Opinion. These
issues should be examined before the
end of 2004.

D  Stem cell import is deemed ethically

impermissible, mainly due to the basic
considerations surrounding the
production of stem cells using human
embryos. As this is deemed an
impermissible instrumentalisation
(destruction) of human life, it follows
that the import of such stem cells must
be rejected. The imported cells carry
the stigma of the conditions under
which they were produced. Their import
will lead to an increase in demand,
thereby directly promoting consumption
of embryos in the exporting countries.
Eventually the level of protection
afforded to embryos will be lowered
also in Germany.

Bearing in mind that the National Ethics
Council is yet to express its opinions on
the basic issues surrounding stem cell
research, and while decisions regarding
the import of embryonic stem cells are still
pending, fifteen Members have moved in
favour of a tightly restricted temporary
import of embryonic stem cells (Option B).
Nine among these fifteen also advocated
Option A. Ten Members favour a
moratorium on stem cell imports for the
time being (Option C), among these four
who are also in favour of Option D.

Biobanks and the biomedical, ethical and
legal implications of storing human bodily
substances and genetic data were also
discussed at a joint session with the
French Consultative Ethics Committee for
Health and Life Sciences (CCNE) on 28
June, 2002 in Berlin

The treatment of biobanks is increasingly
becoming a topic of public debate, and not
just in Germany.

Researchers anticipate the emergence of
new approaches to diagnostic and
therapeutic methods. The procurement,
storage and use of bodily materials and
genetic data, however, impacts strongly
on the patients and donors’ rights as
individuals, right to information, and their
psychological and physical wellbeing. The
economic significance of biobanks also
raises the issue of how the ethical
principle of non-commercialisation of the
human body can be upheld.

The German National Ethics Commission
and the French Consultative Ethics
Committee intend to present a joint
Opinion on this matter. Both bodies plan
to continue issuing joint statements on
subjects that are in discussion both in
Germany and in France.

Genetic diagnosis prior to and during
pregnancy (PGD/PND)

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not
performed in Germany. It is generally held
that PGD is prohibited under the Embryo
Protection Act.
The ethical and legal issues arising in
connection with PID relate to the moral and
constitutional status of the embryo in
question, the rights of the couples wishing to
have PGD, and possible conflicting values in
dealing with an abortion following pre-natal
diagnosis (PND) and a ban on PGD.

The Ethics Council will publish its Opinion in
early 2003.

Collection and storage of biological data
and materials (biobanks)

The National Ethics Council has been debating
this issue since May 2002 and will continue to
do so during the coming months. A joint
debate with the French National Consultative
Ethics Committee (Comité Consultatif National
d’Ethique) has been planned, with the first
session scheduled to take place during the
Franco-German meeting in late June 2002 in
Berlin. 

From the perspective of biomedical research,
biobanks are instrumental in the acquisition of
important knowledge that enables the
dedicated, continued development of
therapeutic and diagnostic methods and
applications. The economic potential of
biobanks is substantial and as such of great
interest to the pharmaceuticals industry, for
instance.
In this context, the role of patients and
donors, their basic rights as individuals as well
as their right to information must be given due
consideration.

The ethical and legal implications of biobanks
become particularly apparent e.g. when
considering the possible reuse of collected
bodily materials for other purposes. In this
respect, it is still unclear to what extent the
patients and donors, or their families, must be
informed in order to gain their consent.

THE AUSTRALIAN  HEALTH
ETHICS  COMMITTEE (AHEC),
A PRINCIPAL COMMITTEE OF
AUSTRALIA’S NHMRC

The Australian Health Ethics Committee
(AHEC) is one of the principal committees of
the National Health and Medical Research
Council (NHMRC).  Established under an Act of
Parliament, the NHMRC is Australia’s leading
expert body promoting the development and
maintenance of public health standards
through the provision of evidence-based
health advice, investment in high-impact
health and medical research ,and the
consideration of ethical issues in health.

The Minister for Health and Ageing appoints as
members to AHEC people with expertise,
knowledge or experience in philosophy;
ethics;  medical research;  public health;
social science research;  clinical medical
practice;  nursing or allied health;  law;
religion;  people with understanding of health
consumer issues;  and of the concerns of
people with disabilities.

The main functions of AHEC are:

(cid:2) 

to advise the NHMRC on ethical issues
relating to health.

Important recent AHEC publications containing
examples of this advice are listed below.

AHEC’s public consultation processes and
its publications are the primary means of
fulfilling this function.

(cid:2) 

to monitor the work of Human
Research Ethics Committees
(HRECs).

The task of the 210 or more HRECs in
institutions across Australia is to review
proposals for research involving humans,
to ensure that such research is soundly
designed and conducted according to high
ethical standards, so that the welfare of
participants is protected.  HRECs are
guided in this work by the National
Statement (see above).

(cid:2) 

to monitor and advise on
international developments in
health ethics.

AHEC monitors and advises on
international developments in health
ethics issues through liaison with relevant
international organisations and
individuals, including the World Health
Organization, and by attending
international fora.

the result of contributions from over 50
authors and has three parts:  a commentary
on the National Statement;  a research ethics
collection;  and a research law collection.  The
‘collections’ discuss ethical and legal issues
which are relevant to the review and conduct
of research involving humans.

embryonal stem cells.  On 25 September
2002, the Australian House of Representatives
voted to pass the Research Involving Embryos
Bill 2002.  The Bill was subsequently
introduced into the Senate on 15 October
2002.  Assuming the Bill becomes legislation,
it is proposed that the revised guidelines will
underpin the new regulatory regime which will
govern research involving embryos.

possible, be members of the national
councils of ethics.
The committee has adopted a system of
yearly chairmanship rotation among the
member countries.   

TASKS 

The Committee’s tasks are:

- to identify ethical problems arising from
genetic engineering and other
biotechnology research, development and
modification of micro organisms, plants,
animals and humans.
- to promote Nordic collaboration among
researchers, opinion formers and
parliamentarians on bioethical issues by
cooperating with national research
institutions, authorities and ethics
committees, and by the same token
creating opportunities for the exchange of
information.
- to contribute to a joint Nordic debate on
bioethical questions by disseminating
material that can be used in constructive
discussions of bioethics issues.
- to monitor biotechnological
developments in the Nordic region and
internationally.
- to keep abreast of Nordic and
international debate on ethical questions
issuing from biotechnology research,
development and application.
- to follow legislative developments within
the sphere of biotechnology in the Nordic
countries. 

WORKING APPROACHES

The Nordic Committee on Bioethics
arranges workshops, hearings,
conferences, symposia and public
talks/lectures in order to contribute to the
exchange of information between
researchers, parliamentarians and opinion
leaders on current issues in bioethics.
The Committee publishes reports and
other publications to promote Nordic and
international debate on issues of bioethics.  

THE NORDIC COMMITTEE ON
BIOETHICS

The Nordic Committee on Bioethics was
formed out of the ”Nordic Committee on
Ethics”, which was set up in 1989 by the
Nordic Council of Ministers in connection with
a Nordic collaborative project on
biotechnology. In 1996 the Committee
changed its name to the Nordic Committee on
Bioethics. 

Nordic cooperation on bioethics is considered
important because 

-  ethical issues in biotechnology and

-

- 

- 

- 

genetic engineering are increasingly
important topics today and in the
future.
the Nordic countries have highly
developed biotechnology and bioethical
knowledge. Progress in all areas is not
equal in the Nordic countries. Thus it is
of great value that there is a Nordic
forum where the development of the
individual countries in the area of
bioethics and the public discussion on
these issues can be monitored.
the Nordic region has common cultural
and ethical considered opinions which it
is important to abide by.
this requires the exchange of
information, interdisciplinary
cooperation and joint conferences. 
it is important to bring to the attention
shared Nordic values in dealings with
the Council of Europe and the European
Union.

MANDATE

To further promote Nordic cooperation and
exchange of information between scientists,
parliamentarians and opinion leaders on
ethical aspects of biotechnological research,
development and application a Nordic
committee on Bioethics was formed in 1989.
The committee’s mandate has been renewed
several times. The present mandate is for the
years 2002-2004.

The Committee has two members from each
of the Nordic countries Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway and Sweden and represents
broad-based knowledge in biotechnology and
bioethics. Members are nominated by the
national ministries for education/ research and
they are appointed by the Nordic Council of
Ministers for a period of three years that can

employees  vis-à-vis to employers.  Equally  the
Commission  regards  as  unacceptable  the
disclosure  of  genetic  information,  even  with
the  consent  of  the  insured  or  prospective
insured, 
in  the  context  of  public  social
insurance  or  private  insurance  when  the
concerned  person  is  not  covered  by  public
social  security.  Finally, 
the  Commission
stressed  the  need  for  clear  operation  rules  of
biobanks and databases regarding the storage
of biological samples and genetic information.

Regarding  the  draft  bill  on  medically
assisted human reproduction; the Commission
welcomed  the  government’s  initiative  and
stressed that the right to reproduction and the
right  to  family  allow  of  limits  because  of  their
connection  with  the  rights  of  a  third  person
and the interests of the child to be born. Thus,
the  Commission  endorsed  the  view  that
recourse  to  methods  of  assisted  reproduction
should  be  permitted  only  for  medical  reasons
and  considered  legitimate  the  prohibition  of
reproductive  cloning  and  sex-selection.  Most
the  provisions
members  considered 
related  to  the  right  of  single  or  unmarried
persons to recourse for medical reasons to the
methods of assisted reproduction are ethically
acceptable,  while  two  members  expressed
reservations  because  they  consider  that  law
should  not  either  encourage  or  explicitly
permit  alternative 
family  schemes.  With
respect  to  the  provision  permitting  surrogate
motherhood  with  a  court  authorization,  the
Commission was divided. Reservations on this
matter  related  either  to  the  psychological  and
or
of 
biological 
commercialization issues of both embryos and

THE NORWEGIAN MODEL 

The Norwegian model of organizing national
research committees is unique. While medical
ethics and bioethics have received a lot of
attention and are institutionalized in many
countries, ethical issues in other areas of
research have traditionally played a
subordinate role. 

In 1988-89 the Norwegian Government
proposed the establishment of three national
committees for research ethics. This proposal
was approved by Parliament in 1990, and a
mandate was worked out by the Ministry of
Education, Research and Church Affairs. 

The three independent but coordinated
national committees for research ethics cover
all scientific disciplines. It is a characteristic
feature of the Norwegian model that the
committees do not only deal with issues within
the more narrowly defined field of research
ethics, but include the broader field of the
ethics of science. This includes issues of
scientific responsibility for larger social
concerns.

The members of the committees are appointed
by the Ministry of Education, Reseach and
Chrurch Affairs upon recommendation from
the Research Council of Norway. This
procedure ensures both political independence
and scientific competence. All members are
selected on the basis of personal
qualifications, none function as
representatives of interest groups. In each

The National Committee for Medical
Research Ethics, NEM

NEM’s work is based on the Helsinki
declaration, a set of international
principles for medical research, drawn up
by the World Medical Association in 1964
and revised in 2000. NEM coordinates the
efforts of the Norwegian Regional
Committees for Reviewing Medical
Research on Humans, that were
established in 1985, covering Norway’s
five health regions. These committees
review all projects in medicine that involve
medical research on humans.

The Norwegian system for ethical
reviewing of research projects differs from
systems in other countries:

(cid:2) 

the committees are regional 

(cid:2)  medical experts are not in the

majority 

(cid:2) 

(cid:2) 

(cid:2) 

the committees are advisory 

there is no possibility for appeal 

the committees are autonomous 

NEM has prepared several reports and
recommendations, bases on own initiative
or as a result of consultations. The
committee arranges conferences,
workshops and hearings.

The National Committee for Research
Ethics in Science and Technology,
NENT

NENT has selected four areas of special
concern for its work:

(cid:2)  biotechnology and genetic engineering 

(cid:2) 

scientific misconduct

(cid:2) 

risk and safety 

(cid:2)  ethics in litterature research

(cid:2)  environment, sustainability and

resource allocation 

(cid:2) 

confidentiality and the protection of
informants in research 

(cid:2) 

information technology, privacy, safety
and security issues 

NENT has been instrumental in establishing an
internal ethical review process for all project
proposals within the fields of science and
technology at The Research Council of Norway

Although the committee does not routinely
involve itself in ethical evaluations of projects,
it does give advice in problematic cases.

The National Committee for Research
Ethics in the Social Sciences and the
Humanities, NESH

NESH concerns itself with research ethics
within the fields of social science, the
humanities, law and theology. The committee
holds seminars, conferences and hearings on
research ethical questions within its field of
expertise, advises authorities and researchers,
and submits statements on projects upon
request. The committee’s guidelines for
research ethics in the social sciences, law and
the humanities was first published in 1993 and
revised in 1999. They are available in English.

CNECV – National Council of Ethics for the
Life Sciences

AIMS, STRUCTURE and WORKING
PROCEDURE

AIMS

The  National  Council  of  Ethics  for  the  Life
Sciences  (CNECV)  was  instituted  by  Law  no.
14/90  of  the  9th  of  June;  its  aims  are  the
following:

a)  to  analyse  systematically  the  moral
problems  arising  from  scientific  advances
in the fields of biology, medicine or Health;
b)  to issue  Opinions and other documents
concerning such problems;
c)  to  raise  public  awareness,  through
public  conferences  and  debates,  of  the
ethical problems in the general field of the
life sciences.
Besides  ethical  problems  in  medicine  and
Health,  the  Council  must  also  analyse  the
moral issues arising from problems in biology,
which  encompasses  the  study  of  non-human
living beings, ecology and our relationship with
the natural environment.

National  Councils  of  Ethics  are  particularly

called for by three facts:

First  of  all,  the  advances  in  science  and
scientific  applications  relating  to  life.  These
open up a wide range of ethical interrogations
which,  formulated  in  the  negative,  refer  to
in  the  past  or  being
abuses  committed 
committed  at  present 
the
manipulation of human beings.

involve 

that 

Secondly,  a  new  awareness 

that  a
multidisciplinary  approach  is  indispensable  to
the assessment of the ethical consequences of
such scientific and technical advances. Science
has  multiple  entrance  gates,  none  of  which
offers access to one single centre where some
“super-knowledge” is focussed.

fashion  by 

Third, the  emergence  of  democratic  debate
in  the  heart  of  lived  ethics.  Ethical  decisions
that  produce  a  visible,  tangible  impact  on
everyday  social  behaviour  cannot  be  imposed
in  purely  authoritarian 
the
established  authorities,  be  they  political  or
scientific.  That  is  why,  ensuing  from  the  two
facts  mentioned  above,  ethical  debates
emerged 
democratic
societies.  What  is  needed,  however,  is  that
such  debates  be  organised  so  as  to  render
them  as  convenient  as  possible,  so  that  the
therefrom  may  be  duly

important  considering

the
issues  at  stake  in  the  life  sciences  have

that 

It cannot be the intention of a National
Council  of  Ethics  for  the  Life  Sciences  to
impose  on  society  the  conclusions  of  its
work  but  only  to  issue  duly  pondered
recommendations.  Its  authority  is  one  of
influence,  not  coercion;  its  aim  is  not  the
exercise  of  political  power  but 
the
acquisition  and  spreading  of  wisdom  that
may  help  society  make  the  decisions  it
deems to be convenient.

its  President,  the  National
Council  of  Ethics  for  the  Life  Sciences
(CNECV) 
twenty
personalities  of  recognised  merit:  seven
are  chosen  from  the  field  of  the  human
and  social  sciences,  seven  from  biology
and  medicine,  and  the  remaining  six  are
chosen bearing in mind the leading ethical

inter- 

Aiming  at  the  constitution  of  a  Council
that  is  open  to  all  relevant  sectors  of
Portuguese  society,  this  Law  stipulates
that the twenty CNECV members are to be
appointed  by  fourteen  different  entities
(Parliament,  five  Ministers,  the  Council  of
Deans  of  Portuguese  Universities,  the
Lisbon  Academy  of  Science,  the  Lawyers’
and  Medical  Associations,  INIC  (National
Institute  of  Scientific  Research),  JNICT
(National  Commission  for  Scientific  and
Technological  Research), 
the  Higher
Council  of  Forensic  Medicine  and  the
Commission for the Equality and Rights of
Women). 

The Prime Minister appoints the CNECV
President.  The  Council  as  a  whole  has  a
tenure  of  five  years.  The  Law  does  not
restrict the re-appointment of members at
the end  of their term of office. A  member
who  resigns  during  his/her  term  of  office
is  to  be  replaced  by  the  entity  that
appointed him/her but such a replacement
shall  have  effect  only  until  the  end  of
tenure of the whole Council.

The Council’s Opinions have produced a
impact  on  the  elaboration  of
visible 
legislation. 
“an
Moreover, 
independent body” (Art.1 of Law no.14/90

being 

22

of  the  9th  of  June),  the  Council  is  entitled  to
emit  critical  appreciations  of  an  ethical  nature
on  the  legal  instruments  that  come  out.  In
fact, it has done so a number of times.

The  independent  character  of  the  CNECV
also  entails 
its  members  are  not
dependent,  regarding  their  actions,  on  the
entities that appointed them.

that 

From  1991  up  to  June  1999,  the  CNECV
issued 
five
twenty-seven  Opinions,  held 
Seminars  and  published  five  books  containing
Documentation,  as  well  as 
five  others
containing  the  Acts  of  the  Seminars.  All  of
these publications are available on request.

The  CNECV  has  its  own  Head  Office  on  the
8th 
floor  of  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office
Building, run by an Executive Secretary with a
rank  equal  to  ministerial  office  secretary
(Decree-Law 193/99 of the 7th of June).

Besides  possible  expense  allowances,
members  of  the  Council  receive  “attendance
vouchers”  (Art.10  of  Law  no.14/90  of  the  9th
of  June).  All  discharge  their  duties  over  and
above  their  own  work  and  none  works  at  the
Council full-time.

WORKING PROCEDURE

Pursuant 

Internal
to  Art.  4  of 
Regulations  (By-Laws),  the  CNECV  holds  its
plenary  meetings  once  a  month  in  the  Prime
Minister’s  Office  Building,  at  Rua  Prof.  Gomes
Teixeira, 1350 Lisbon. 

its 

Usually,  the  plenary  sessions  run  for  three
and a half-hours, followed by a meeting of the
Council’s  Co-ordination  Committee. 
The
Council  does  not  delegate 
its  principal
capacities to the Co-ordination Committee (cf.
Art.  2,  §  2  of  Law  no.14/90  of  the  9th  of
June);  the  priority  task  of  the  latter  is  the
formal  preparation  of  meetings,  publications
and  Seminars,  as  well  as  the  analysis  of  the
Council’s financial management.

A  few  supplementary  meetings  have  been
held  (Art.4  of  the  by-laws)  for  the  purpose  of
finalising 
the  elaboration  and  voting  of
Opinions that should not be delayed. 

A  simple  majority  of  the  CNECV,  that  is  to
the

constitutes 

say 
eleven  members, 
“quorum” for a plenary meeting.

In  the  course  of  its  first  tenure  –  i.e.  not
from  the  start  –,  the  Council  gradually
instituted the habit of hearing, for the sake of
a  multidisciplinary  perspective,  experts  who
specialise  in  areas  pertinent  to  the  matter  of
each Opinion.

Pursuant  to  Art.  7  of  Law  14/90  of  the  9th
of June, the  following public entities or bodies
may  request  an  Opinion:  the  President  of  the

Republic, Parliament, Government officials
or  other  entities  who  have  the  right  to
appoint  Council  members,  and  “public  or
private  institutions  wherein  are  practised
techniques with  ethical implications  in  the
fields of biology, medicine or health care.”
The Council may also issue Opinions on its
own initiative.

At  the  start  and  at  any  time  during  its
tenure,  the  Council  elaborates  a  list  of
their
working  matters  by  order  of 
importance,  their  urgency,  their  present
relevance  and  their  scientific  and  social
impact.  This  priority  list  may  be  changed
due  to  requests  by  the  above-mentioned
entities, or to the occurrence of some new
“urgency”.

The time an Opinion takes to be issued
is  variable,  and  bears  no  correspondence
with  its  length.  An  Opinion  that  takes  up
several  working  sessions  may  be  quite
shorts (e.g. the Opinion on death criteria)
or  quite 
the  Opinion  on
medically assisted procreation).

long  (e.g. 

Usually,  an  Opinion  is  preceded  by  a
special Report. The Council charges one or
more  of  its  members  with  the  task  of
writing  a  Report  and  a  draft  Opinion  on  a
given  subject.  The  debate  of  each  Report
in a plenary meeting incised only upon its
global  organisation  and 
the  overall
grounding  of  its  arguments.  The  style  of
each  Report  maintains  a  close  connection
with 
it  bears  the
author’s  signature  (although  there  were
exceptions in the first works presented by
the  Council).  The  text  of  the  Opinion,  on
the contrary, is thoroughly debated by the
Council,  for  it  reflects  the  Council’s  stand
on  the  matter  –  and  thus  the  President
signs  it.  Any  member  of  the  Council  who
so  wishes  may  append  a  personal
declaration of vote to the final Opinion.

CURRENT WORK

Pharmacogenetics:  Ethical Issues

People  often  respond  differently  to  the
same  medicine.  Some  medicines  are  not
effective  for  everyone;  others  may  cause
adverse side-effects, or even death. These
different  responses  may  be  partly  due  to
our  different  genetic  make-up.  Research
investigates  how
in  pharmacogenetics 
genetic  variation  between 
individuals
affects  their  responses  to  medicine.  The
clinical  applications  of  this  research  may
not  be  widespread  for  some  years,  but  it
is  important  to  consider  ethical  and  legal
issues  which  may  arise.    The  Nuffield
Council has recently established a Working
Party  which  will  consider  these  issues.    A
consultation  paper  has  been  issued,  with
responses  invited  by  19  February  2003.
The  Council  will  publish  a  Report  in  the
autumn of 2003.

Ethics of Research involving animals

trend 

The Council held a Workshop on the ethics
of research involving animals in November
2001.    As  a  result  of  this  meeting,  the
Council has decided to establish a Working
Party  to  consider  the  issues  in  more
depth.  A number of factors were regarded
as  warranting  consideration,  particularly
the  rising 
the  number  of
in 
genetically  modified  animals,  and  the
developments  regarding  Huntingdon  Life
Sciences and the activities of animal rights
organisations.    Certain  issues,  whilst  not
necessarily 
from
clarification,  for  example  whether  or  not
there  are  morally  relevant  distinctions  to
be  made  between  different  species,  and
questions  raised  by  genetic  modification.

being selected.

The  Council  will  also  continue  to  identify
potential  topics  for  further  examination,  and

2003  to  allow  preliminary  discussion  of  the
issues.      A  Workshop  on  end-of-life  issues  is
planned for early 2003.

RECENT PUBLICATIONS

The ethics of research related to
healthcare in developing countries
Published April 2002

Developing  countries  urgently  need  research
to  help  relieve  the  enormous  burden  of
disease that they carry. It is vital that those in
wealthy  countries,  both  in  the  public  and
private sector, help sponsor this research. But
rigorous ethical safeguards must be in place to
prevent  the  exploitation  of  those  who  take
part in the research.   This Report defines the
ethical  standards  for  healthcare  research  in
developing  countries. 
It  will  provide  a
framework  for  anyone  who  is  designing  or
research.  The  Report's
conducting  such 
recommendations  focus  on  standards  of  care,
consent,  ethical  review  of  research  and  what
happens when the research is over.

The ethics of patenting DNA: a discussion
paper
Published July 2002

Several  thousand  patent  applications  have
been  made  on  human  genes.  But 
the
substantial increase in the rate of patenting of
DNA sequences has led to considerable debate
about  the  acceptability  of  this  practice.  This
Discussion Paper argues that patents involving
DNA sequences should be the exception rather
than  the  rule.  It  makes  recommendations  for
future  policy  in  the  area,  including  a  number
of  significant changes to the way that  patents
are  granted  involving  DNA  sequences.  Most
importantly,  the  tests  of  inventiveness  and
usefulness  should  be  more  rigorously  applied
when  considering  if  a  patent  should  be
granted.  The  Paper  also  notes  that  some
patents that have already been granted are of
doubtful  validity  and  makes  recommendations
to  limit  the  possible  adverse  effects  of  these
patents.

research 

Researchers  in  the  field  of  behavioural
genetics  are  attempting  to  locate  specific
genes, or groups of genes, associated with
behavioural  traits  and  to  understand  the
complex  relationship  between  genes  and
the  environment.  This  Report  considers
the ethical, legal and social issues that are
raised  by 
into  behavioural
genetics.  It  focuses  on  human  behaviour
within  the  normal  range  of  variation,
looking  at  traits  such  as  intelligence,
antisocial  behaviour,  personality  and
sexual  orientation.  After  discussing  the
historical and scientific background to this
research,

implications  and  possible  applications.    It
considers the issues raised by changing or
selecting behavioural traits on the basis of
genetic  information  and  examines  the
possible  uses  of  such  information  in  the

justice  system,  and 
contexts  of  education,  employment  and

BELGIAN ADVISORY COMMITTEE
ON BIOETHICS

The Belgian Advisory Committee on Bioethics
was established by the co-operation
agreement of 15 January 1993 signed by the
federal Government, the French-speaking
Community, the Flemish Community, the
German-speaking Community and the Joint
ComMrsion for Community Matters1. The
Committee is completely independent of the
authorities that created it.

The Committee’s duties are twofold:

(cid:2)  To provide advice on the problems raised
by research and research applications in
the fields of biology, medicine and health
care; these problems are studied from the
ethical, social and legal points of view,
particularly from the angle of the respect
for human rights;

(cid:2)  To inform the public and the authorities

about these problems. 

COMPOSITION OF THE COMMITTEE

1 This Co-operation Agreement was published in the
Belgisch Staatsblad/Moniteur belge of 12 May 1993; it
was approved by the federal Government through an Act
of 6 March 1995, and by the three Communities
mentioned above through a Decree respectively dated 6
December 1993, 16 March 1994 and 15 June 1994, and
by the Joint ComMrsion for Community Matters through
an Ordinance of 30 March 1995.

for Community Matters 

When composing the Committee, attention is
paid to a balanced representation of the
various ideological and philosophical
movements, to a balanced number of men and
women and to an equal number of Dutch- and
French-speaking members. The same applies
to a balance between members from academia
and the medical professions and those from
the philosophical, legal and life science
communities.

session of the Committee are intended to
open up the debate, to provoke any
possible amendments that the select
committee takes into account in its final
opinion.

The meetings of the Committee and of
the select committee are not open to the
public. In principle, the Committee
expresses its opinion within six months
following the request. The approved
opinions reflect the various positions
put forward.

Members of the Committee are appointed for a
period of 4 years.

THE  DISSEMINATION  OF  THE  WORK  OF
THE COMMITTEE

THE FUNCTIONING OF THE COMMITTEE 

The Committee has a Bureau, composed of 4
vice-chairpersons chosen from among its
members; each vice-chair in turn fills the
chairmanship for one year.

Seventy-five per cent of the Committee’s
operational costs are borne by the federal
authorities; the remaining 25 per cent are split
up equally among the Communities.

The Committee has a Secretariat, consisting
of 6 civil servants seconded from the clerical
staff of the signatories to the Agreement
following a call for candidates published in the
Belgisch Staatsblad/Moniteur belge. The
Secretariat carries out technical and
administrative tasks.

TERMS OF REFERENCE

The Committee is required to give its opinion
at the request of the chairs of the various
parliaments or of any member of their
governments, as well as at the request of a
research institute, a hospital, a higher-
education establishment and of the local
ethical committee of either a hospital or a
university or an ethical committee approved
by any of the Communities.

The Committee may also give advice on its
own initiative. In most cases, the Committee
entrusts the task of preparing the opinion to a
select committee. The latter’s composition
reflects that of the Committee. The select
committees may rely on outside experts for
some specific hearing as well as to permanent
experts. The select committee sends a report
of its work to the Committee together with a
draft opinion. The discussions at the plenary

29

The Committee draws up an annual
report containing its opinions, a list of the
pending requests for advice and a survey
of activities of the local ethical committees
of hospitals and universities. This report is
sent to the Belgian political authorities
(notably to the presidents of the Senate
and the Chamber of Representatives, the
Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, the
Ministers responsible for science policy
and public health, the presidents of the
community parliaments and to the Prime
ministers of their governments) and to
everyone who so request. 

The Committee automatically sends its
opinions to the persons who posed the
question underlying the opinion. They are
also systematically sent to the presidents
of the various legislative assemblies, to
the Prime Ministers, Vice-Prime Ministers
and concerned Ministers of the various
governments. Finally, the Committee’s
opinions are sent in full to the Belga press
agency and to individuals on simple
demand.

Since the Committee is eager to
disseminate its work on as large a scale as
possible, it 

(cid:2)  publishes a brochure called

« Bioethica Belgica », available on
written request from the Committee’s
Secretariat, which contains all the
opinions and annual reports;
runs an internet site :
www.health.fgov.be/bioeth

(cid:2) 

(cid:2)  holds press conferences where it
explains some of the opinions and
reviews the annual activities;

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  painfully  confirmed  what  experts  have  warned 
against  since  the  2009  H1N1  and  2014-2016  Ebola  pandemics:  the  world  has 
been gravely under-prepared for large outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. 

The  EU  is  drawing  lessons  from  the  COVID-19  crisis,  with  new  policy  initiatives 
brought  forward  by  the  European  Commission  on  better  preparedness  for  future 
health  threats.  To  support  and  inform  that  process,  we  as  science  and  ethics 
advisors have examined evidence on the responses to the COVID-19 and, in part, 
to previous pandemics – which has revealed important lessons learned and to be 
learned.  On  that  basis,  we  have  formulated  a  range  of  recommendations,  which 
are summarised below.  

Prevent and pre-empt 

(cid:2)  Support  multifaceted  efforts  to  investigate,  map  and  reduce  the  risk  of 
emerging  infectious  diseases  globally,  including  the  surveillance  of 
pathogen  reservoirs,  mitigation,  forecasting  and  early  detection  of 
potential outbreaks.  

(cid:2)  Support a combination of complementary approaches for accelerating the 
research  on  and  development  of  responses  to  pathogens  with  epidemic 
and pandemic potential. 

(cid:2)  Strengthen  multi-  and  cross-disciplinary 

research  on  pandemic 
prevention,  preparedness,  responses  and  impacts,  analysing  the  multi-
faceted societal aspects and consequences of health crises.  

Enhance coordination across Member States and at 
international level 

(cid:2) 

(cid:2) 

(cid:2) 

Establish  a  standing  EU  advisory  body  for  health  threats  and  crises, 
including epidemics and pandemics. This body should  liaise with advisory 
bodies  in  the  Member  States  as  well  as  at  EU  and global  level.  It  should 
have  a  multidisciplinary  and  inclusive  membership  so  it  can  advise  on 
biomedical,  behavioural,  social,  economic,  cultural,  ethical, 
legal, 
technological and international aspects.  

Ensure  that  monitoring  efforts  are  comprehensive,  evidence-based, 
rapidly  shared  and  well-coordinated  across  the  EU,  enabling  strategic 
decisions in response to the situation at hand, insights through real-time 
comparisons, as well as collective action where appropriate.  

Establish  a  joint  early-response  mechanism  to  contain  epidemics  and 
pandemics, including a toolbox of strategies, such as testing, tracing, and 
isolating  as  well  as  containment  measures.  Any  strategy  needs  to  be 
based on scientific evidence, guided by the fundamental rights framework 
and applied in a situation-dependent manner. Herd immunity is a concept

best  applied  in  the  context  of  vaccine-acquired  immunity. Achieving herd 
immunity  through  natural  infection  by  a  previously  unknown  pathogen 
involving  risks  to  life  and  health  conflicts  with  the  WHO’s  ethical 
framework  and  its  multi-principled  approach,  requiring  that  utility  and 
equity considerations are balanced.  

(cid:2)  Coordinate research and the development and implementation of medical 
countermeasures  during  a  pandemic  or  other  health  threat.  Crucial 
scientific  questions  should  be  clarified  as  quickly  as  possible  after  the 
onset of a health threat such as a pandemic to rapidly inform effective and 
safe public health measures.  

(cid:2)  Coordinate  research  and  the  development  and  evaluation  of  social 
measures to mitigate harm and to increase resilience in case of pandemics 
or  other  public  health  crises.  Social,  economic,  ethical,  psychosocial  and 
cultural  challenges  raised  by  a  pandemic  should  be  addressed  as  quickly 
as  possible  after  its  onset  to  inform  a  range  of  nuanced  and  locally 
appropriate measures.  

Strengthen systems for preparedness and management 

(cid:2)

Encourage  Member  States  to  provide  healthcare  for  all,  respecting  the 
principles  of  justice  and  solidarity  and  adhering  to  the  commitments 
established  in  the  context  of  European  fundamental  rights  instruments, 
such  as  the  European  Pillar  of  Social  Rights,  and  the  Sustainable 
Development Goals.  

Ensure robust and equitable access to critical products and services for all 
EU citizens and demonstrate global solidarity. This involves pre-emptively 
providing criteria for the allocation, among and within Member States, of 
limited resources essential to manage a pandemic and mitigate harm, with 
due regard to the moral equality of all persons.  

Encourage Member States to strengthen public health infrastructure as an 
essential  part  of  efficient  and  equitable  health  services,  including 
interoperable  and  interconnected  health  information  systems;  develop 
rapid  and  reliable  testing  and  tracing  systems  supported  by  laboratory 
networks  and  monitoring  capabilities;  build  public  health  workforce 
capacity and strengthen community infrastructures of social care.

disinfection,  avoiding  air  recirculation  and  overcrowding.  Such  measures 
can  help  to  avoid  the  need  for  applying  more  invasive  and  restrictive 
measures such as the closure of educational institutions and work places.  

Uphold fundamental rights and strengthen social justice 

(cid:2)  Uphold highest standards in the protection of fundamental rights and civil 
liberties  during  pandemics.  In  the  rare  case  of  encroachments  on  rights

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

This  year,  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic,  caused  by  the  SARS-
CoV-2  virus,  has  painfully  confirmed  what  many  reports  and  papers  had  already 
expressed  since  the  2009  H1N1  and  2014-2016  Ebola  pandemics:  the  world  is 
gravely  under-prepared  for  large  outbreaks  of  emerging  infectious  diseases 
(GPMB, 2019; Moon et al., 2017; Nuzzo et al., 2019). 

Although sometimes referred to as very rare and unexpected ‘black swan’ events, 
scientists,  healthcare  practitioners  and  others  had  warned  policy  makers  of  the 
high likelihood of pandemics. Epidemics and pandemics have occurred throughout 
human  history  and  are  the  predictable  result  of  an  increasingly  growing, 
urbanised  and  mobile  human  world  population  that  is  expanding  into  and 
exploiting the natural world (UNEP & ILRI, 2020; IPBES, 2020). Indeed, COVID-19 
is the latest in a series of recent epidemics and pandemics, and will not be the last 
one.  In  fact,  the  rate  of  emerging  infectious  disease  outbreaks  seems  to  be 
increasing  significantly  over  time  (GPMB,  2019;  Jones  et  al.,  2008;  Moon  et  al., 
2017; Smith et al., 2014). In addition, the socioeconomic costs of these outbreaks 
are also reported to be increasing (Dobson et al., 2020). 

Besides the costs of lives and health, epidemics and pandemics have devastating 
effects  on  societal  and  individual  wellbeing  more  largely.  They  strongly  impact 
economies,  livelihoods  and  psychosocial  wellbeing  across  entire  communities. 
Measures  taken  to  mitigate  them  can  come  with  threats  to  civil  liberties  and 
fundamental rights.  

Even  though  insights  in  the  exact  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  are 
tentative  and  evolving,  it  has  already  become  clear  that  both  the  disease  and 
some  emergency  countermeasures  have  had  substantial  socio-economic  costs, 
often  hitting  the  marginalised  and  most  vulnerable  in  society  the  hardest  (e.g. 
Bambra  et  al.,  2020;  ECDC,  2020b;  UN,  2020).  We  have  also  been  witnessing 
how  real-time  global  communication  via  social  networks  facilitates  the  spreading 
of  denialism  and  misinformation  and  has  resulted  in  both  damaging  under-  and 
over-reactions (Frutos et al., 2020).  

The  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  responses  to  it  have  moreover  caused  other 
medical conditions to go untreated as regular healthcare was interrupted; school 
closures  have  exacerbated  inequalities  in  access  to  education;  domestic  violence 
has  increased;  and  mental  health  and  personal  well-being  of  entire  populations 
have  been  negatively  affected  (de  Pedraza  et  al.,  2020;  Feral-Pierssens  et  al., 
2020; Nicola et al., 2020; Sharp et al., 2020).  

This  highlights  the  centrality  of  values,  such  as  solidarity,  equity  and  social 
justice,  to  societal  resilience,  as  well  as  the  importance  of  response  strategies 
taking the diversity of risks brought about by pandemics into account and building 
on  respective  long-term  considerations.  The  current  experience  shows  that  good 
pandemic management is nuanced and is rooted in the scientific understanding of 
both  the  disease  and  its  effects,  coupled  with  critical  societal  and  ethical

considerations.  It  also  confirms  that  preparedness  consists  in  building  resilient 
institutions based on sustainability and social justice. 

This joint Opinion addresses how Europe can ensure better management of, and 
preparedness for, epidemics and pandemics. It builds on lessons learned from the 
current crisis and other epidemics and pandemics and provides recommendations 
for improvement. It is intended to inform responses and policies in the context of 
pandemics at European level, among them the European Commission’s legislative 
proposals for a strengthened Health Union. 

This joint Opinion is a continuation of the cooperation between the Group of Chief 
Scientific Advisors to the European Commission, the European Group on Ethics in 
Science  and  New  Technologies  (EGE),  and  the  special  advisor  to  European 
Commission  President  Ursula  von  der  Leyen  on  the  response  to  the  coronavirus 
and  COVID-19.  The  advice  draws  upon  their  collective  expertise  and  analysis  of 
the  current  crisis,  based  on  evidence,  knowledge  and  insights  gathered  from 
expert elicitation and rapid evidence reviews.2 The strength of this Opinion lies in 
its  interdisciplinary  approach,  examining  the  complexity  of  pandemics  in  their 
manifold aspects and combining insights from research with analyses of the ways 
in which European values and fundamental rights can come under pressure in an 
emergency  context  of  this  kind,  but  can  also  serve  as  critical  orientation  during 
crises. 

In June, we published a joint statement giving guidance to politicians and policy 
makers,  their  advisors  and  the  scientific  community  on  how  policy  advice  may

2.  CONDITIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO INCREASING 

RISKS FOR PANDEMICS 

Epidemics  and  pandemics  arise  from  a  wide  range  of  origins,  pathogens  and 
drivers,  making  their  prevention  and  preparedness  complex  (IPBES,  2020).  The 
source of a disease is obviously of biological nature, human behaviour and socio-
economic  and  ecological  factors  are  also  key  drivers  of  their  emergence  and 
spreading. 

Pathogens may be newly  emerging, i.e. not previously  recognised in humans,  or 
re-emerging  or  resurging,  for  example  due  to  acquired  resistance  to  treatment 
(e.g.  malaria,  tuberculosis)  or  inadequate  vaccination  of  the  population  (e.g. 
measles,  diphtheria).  Indeed,  the  increase  of  vaccine  hesitancy  and  dropping 
vaccination  coverage  are  worrying  developments, which have already resulted in 
unprecedented  outbreaks  of  vaccine-preventable  diseases  in  the  EU  (Bechini  et 
al.,  2019).  Besides  naturally  emerging,  pathogens  might  also  be  released 
accidentally  (e.g.  from  research  labs)  or  deliberately  (in  case  of  biological 
weapons and bioterrorism agents such as anthrax), which require considerations 
of biosafety and biosecurity (GPMB, 2019; Nuzzo et al., 2019). 

Most  concerning  and  high-impact  outbreaks  have  been  caused  by  viruses 
(including  COVID-19,  HIV/AIDS,  Ebola,  Zika  and  pandemic  influenza)  (Adalja  et 
al., 2018; Morse et al., 2012; Simpson et al., 2020), but the majority of emerging 
infectious  disease  outbreaks  are  caused  by  bacteria  (e.g.  plague,  anthrax, 
cholera,  Q  fever,  typhus,  rickettsial  diseases)  (Jones  et  al.,  2008;  Smith  et  al., 
2014). Besides viruses (25-40%) (Simpson et al., 2020) and bacteria (48-54%), 
outbreaks  also  emerge  from  prions  (e.g.  Creutzfeldt–Jakob  disease  and  its  BSE-
associated  variant  vCJD),  protozoa  (5-11%;  e.g.  malaria,  toxoplasmosis),  fungi 
(2-6%;  e.g.  Candida  infections,  valley  fever)  and  helminths  (3-4%;  e.g. 
schistosomiasis,  soil-transmitted  helminthiases)  (Jones  et  al.,  2008;  Simpson  et 
al., 2020; Smith et al., 2014; Weber et al., 2019). However, the probability that 
these latter organisms cause a pandemic is more limited (Adalja et al., 2018).  

Pathogens  with  pandemic  potential  –  microorganisms  that  constitute  a  ‘global 
catastrophic biological risk’ (GCBR) – typically have common attributes, including 
efficient respiratory transmission between humans; lack of pre-existing immunity 
in  humans;  lack  of  medical  countermeasures  (i.e.  treatments,  vaccines); 
capability  of  spreading  during  incubation  period  prior  to  onset  of  strong 
symptoms;  and  intrinsic  microbial  characteristics  (i.e.  virulence)  (Adalja  et  al., 
2018)  (see  also  Figure  1).  Many  pathogens  mutate  at  a  high  rate,  which  allows 
them to adapt to fluctuating environments, including the host’s immune response. 
In  particular  RNA  viruses  have  very  high  mutation  rates  –  up  to  a  million  times 
higher  than  their  hosts  (Duffy,  2018).  Hyper-mutable  bacteria  have  also  been 
isolated  from  human  patients  (Hall  &  Henderson-Begg,  2006).  Viruses  and 
bacteria  also  have  the  ability  to  transfer  genes  ‘horizontally’  (i.e.  between 
genomes  of  different  strains  or  species).  Bacteria  can  exchange  their  genetic 
material using mobile genetic elements or via bacteriophages (bacterial viruses),

including antimicrobial resistance genes (Botelho & Schulenburg, 2020; Partridge
et al., 2018). Viruses – in particular RNA viruses, due to their increased ability to 
mutate – are the most likely class of pathogens to cause a pandemic, although in 
the  right  context,  any  microbial  organism  could  evolve  or  be  engineered  to 
become a global catastrophic biological risk (GCBR)  (Adalja et al., 2018; Botelho 
& Schulenburg, 2020; Partridge et al., 2018; Simpson et al., 2020).

Figure  1:  Venn  diagram  grouping  selected  pathogens  according  to  three 
major risk factors for pandemics

Major  risk  factors  are  respiratory  transmission,  spread  during  the  incubation  time,  and 
absence of host-immunity (Adalja et al. 2018). For COVID-19 all three risk factors apply. For 
influenza, chicken pox and polio host immunity in the population is ensured by vaccination. 
(Figure developed by the authors)

Due  to  the  discovery  and  development  of  antimicrobials  (e.g.  penicillin, 
ampicillin), the pandemic risk of bacteria has been radically reduced (Adalja et al., 
2018). However, due to misuse of antibiotics there is an increasing emergence of 
antimicrobial-resistant  (AMR)  bacterial  strains  (e.g.  MRSA,  drug-resistant 
tuberculosis), constituting a global public health threat (E. Y. Klein et al., 2018; O’ 
Neil, 2014). An increasing number of at least 700 000 people die each year due to 
drug-resistant  diseases  globally  (low  estimate  for  2014;  O’  Neil,  2014),  with  33 
110  in  Europe  (estimate  for  2015;  Cassini  et  al.,  2019),  making  the  effort  to 
combat antimicrobial-resistance an international priority for global health security. 

The  majority  of  human  infectious  diseases  (58-65%),  including  COVID-19,  is 
zoonotic  (K.  E.  Jones  et  al.,  2008;  Smith  et  al.,  2014;  Taylor et  al.,  2001; 
Woolhouse &  Gowtage-Sequeria,  2005),  meaning  that  the  responsible  pathogens 
are  derived  from  animals  and  transmitted  to  humans.  Nearly  all  these  zoonotic 
pathogens  arise  from  warm-blooded  animals,  predominantly  mammals  and  in

some  cases  birds  (Morse  et  al.,  2012;  Wolfe  et  al.,  2007).  Animals  can  act  as 
‘reservoirs’ of human pathogens, which can result in periodical local re-emergence 
of  a  disease,  but  also  in  spreading  of  the  disease  to  otherwise  unconnected 
human populations by migratory animals, for example. 

Most  animal-to-human  transmissions  occur  where  contact  between  humans  and 
animals  is  close  and/or  frequent,  thus  with  livestock,  domesticated  wildlife  and 
pets,  but  also  with  ‘peri-domestic  wildlife’  (e.g.  rats  and  other  pests)  (UNEP, 
2020). The majority of zoonotic diseases have their origin in wildlife (Jones et al., 
2008),  from  which  they  have  been  transmitted  to  humans  either  directly,  for 
example  due  to  wildlife  and  bush-meat  trade,  or  indirectly  via  (peri-)domestic 
animals  as  intermediate  hosts  (Dobson  et  al.,  2020;  UNEP,  2020).  It  is  well-
established that the emergence of such transmissions is typically driven by human 
activities,  including  deforestation  and  other  changes  to  land  use  (e.g.  for 
construction or intensive crop and livestock farming), wildlife exploitation, as well 
as  increased  meat  consumption,  urbanisation  and  mobility  with  globalised  trade, 
travel and migration (Gibb et al., 2020; Gottdenker et al., 2014; McCloskey et al., 
2014;  Nava  et  al.,  2017;  Petersen  et  al.,  2018;  Simpson  et  al.,  2020;  Stephen, 
2020; UNEP, 2020). 

Many  infectious  diseases  are  vector-borne  (23-25%;  e.g.  malaria,  dengue,  Zika, 
leishmaniosis,  Lyme  disease)  (Jones  et  al.,  2008;  Smith  et  al.,  2014).  With 
vector-borne  diseases,  the  viruses,  bacteria  or  parasites  are  transmitted  – 
between  humans  or  from  animals  to  humans  –  by  other  living  organisms,  often 
bloodsucking insects such as mosquitoes. 

Outbreaks  of  infectious  diseases,  in  particular  zoonoses  and  vector-borne 
diseases, have risen over time and are expected to increasingly emerge as climate 
change worsens (Jones et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2014; Stephen, 2020). Indeed, 
outbreaks  have  been  linked  with  extreme  weather  or  climate  events,  e.g.  with 
unusual  rainfall  and  rising  temperatures,  including  the  resulting  thawing  of 
permafrost,  as  well  as  with  climate  change-associated  effects  on  habitats  and 
geographic range of vectors and disease reservoirs (Anwar et al., 2019; Caminade 
et al., 2019; Fouque & Reeder, 2019; Nava et al., 2017; UNEP, 2020; Waits et al., 
2018).

3.  INEQUALITIES,  DISCRIMINATION  AND  ECONOMIC 

HARDSHIP 

COVID-19  and  previous  pandemics  have  shown  that  the  outbreak  of  a  highly 
infectious  disease  causes  a  broader  societal  crisis  and  highlights  pre-existing 
social ills. This requires responses to be of a holistic nature, addressing all aspects 
and  causes  of  the  crisis,  and  to  aim  for  sustainable  recovery  and  veritable 
resilience.  Comparing  the  various  strategies  rolled  out  by  governments  over  the 
last months across the globe, one lesson learned, as this chapter will show, is the 
need to consider the myriad consequences of a pandemic and their interplay when 
devising crisis preparedness and management plans. 

While  limiting  the  spread  of  the  disease,  lockdowns  and  similar  containment 
measures  have  had  severe  consequences  on  individuals  and  groups.  As  was 
already shown in the  context of former pandemics and epidemics, new empirical 
studies point to the interrelatedness of structural inequalities and the severity of 
the impact of a health crisis, with disadvantaged populations often hit the hardest 
(Bambra et al., 2020). Witnessing the global  and  cross-societal  spread  of  SARS-
CoV-2, it has been posited – often in an effort to support an atmosphere of unity 
and solidarity – that ‘the virus does not discriminate.’ This has been criticised on 
the basis that it disregards the increased vulnerability to the various effects of the 
pandemic  of  the  most  socially  and  economically  deprived  (EGE,  2020).  The 
following  sections  summarise  past  and  ongoing  research  and  thinking  about  the 
links between societal inequities and pandemics.  

Health inequalities 

Complementing  the  history  of  research  showing  clear  links  between  poverty  and 
increased infection risks, a recent study comparing COVID-19 related death rates 
in municipalities of France concluded that mortality is twice as large in the poorest 
municipalities  compared  to  others,  with  housing  conditions  and  occupational 
exposure likely being strong factors (Brandily et al., 2020). Economic pressure or 
precarious  employment  might  lead  to  reluctance  or  inability  to  take  sick  leave, 
consult  physicians,  arrange  teleworking  or  rely  upon  employer-provided  health 
insurance  (Lynch,  2020).4  Statistics  from  Spain  and  the  USA,  as  well  as  a  rich 
body  of  research  conducted  in  the  context  of  the  Spanish  influenza  pandemic  of 
1918  and  the  H1N1  outbreak  of  2009  similarly  indicate  that  socio-economically 
disadvantaged  groups  are  disproportionately  affected  by  infectious  diseases 
(Bambra  et  al.,  2020).  To  describe  the  links  between  health  inequalities  and 
socio-economic status, Bambra et al. (2020) have revived the  analytical concept 
of the “syndemic pandemic”, first developed by Merrill Singer in the 1990s to help

understand  the  relationships  between  HIV/AIDS,  substance  use  and  violence  in 
the USA at the time (Figure 2). 

“A  syndemic  exists  when  risk  factors  or  comorbidities  are  intertwined,  interactive  and 
cumulative  —  adversely  exacerbating  the  disease  burden  and  additively  increasing  its 
negative effects (…). We argue that for the most disadvantaged communities, COVID-19 
is experienced as a syndemic — a co-occurring, synergistic pandemic that interacts with 
and  exacerbates  their  existing  NCDs  [non-communicable  diseases]  and  social 
conditions.” (Bambra et al., 2020)

Besides  poverty,  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  ethnicity  is  known  to  be  a  key 
social determinant of health inequalities. Data from England and Wales show that 
black, Asian and minority ethnic community populations represented 34.5% of the

critically ill COVID-19 patients in the period until 16 April 2020  (ICNARC, 2020). 
This  seems  not  to  have  changed  within  the  second  wave  of  infections.  For 
example,  as  up  to  August  and  in  September  the  non-white  proportion  of  non-
white  patients  admitted  to  intensive  care  units  in  England,  Wales  and  Northern 
Ireland  amounted  to  34%  and  38%  respectively  (ICNARC,  2020).  In  Romania, 
Bulgaria  and  other  Eastern  European  Countries,  some  Roma  communities  faced 
particularly high infection rates, leading to additional stigmatisation and incidents 
of  police  violence  against  them  (e.g.  Matache  &  Bhabha,  2020).  Most  available 
data  on  the  impact  of  ethnicity  on  clinical  outcomes  in  COVID-19  is  drawn  from 
the  UK;  many  other  countries  are  not  disaggregating  data  by  ethnicity.  It  has 
been  suggested  that  more  research  on  this  is  necessary  as  links  appear  to  be 
strong  (Pan  et  al.,  2020; El-Khatib  et  al., 2020). The situation is complicated by 
the fact that ethnic discrimination often corresponds with, and exacerbates, socio-
economic disadvantage. 

Reports also point to disadvantages for migrating people or displaced populations, 
whose living conditions, whether in camps or on the move, often make adherence 
to  public  health  measures  difficult  and  impede  to  access  information  or  to  seek 
medical  or  psycho-social  help  (e.g.  Bukuluki  et  al.,  2020).  Reluctance  to 
implement  containment  measures  in  asylum  seekers’  camps,  for  instance, 
sparked  forms  of  protest  as  dangerous  as  the  Moria  blaze  of  early  September 
2020,5  pointing  to  the  critical  role  of  values  and  fundamental  rights  in  crisis 
management and beyond.6 

Efforts  to  establish  which  groups  might  require  particular  protection  from  SARS-
CoV-2  have  focused  on  an  analysis  of  age  groups,  with  older  persons  being  at 
increased risk of severe disease and death following a COVID-19 infection.7 Strict 
measures  implemented  to  isolate  older  adults  both  from  each  other  and  from 
younger  population  groups,  such  as  with  heavily  restricted  visiting  and 
confinement  rules  in  care  homes,  have  caused  important  debates  about 
intergenerational  solidarity  and  equity  (e.g.  Fletcher,  2020).  In  May  2020,  the 
World  Health  Organization’s  (WHO)  regional  office  reported  that  nearly  every

second  COVID-19  death  in  Europe  has  occurred  in  long-term-care  institutions.8 
Utilitarian suggestions to distribute scarce medical resources in favour of younger 
COVID-19  patients  were  surprisingly  strong.  Ethicists  have  cautioned  against 
weighing  the  value  of  life  of  different  population  groups  according  to  a  resource 
optimisation  calculus,  and  have  warned  against  minimising  older  persons’  worth 
for society, their right to high-quality healthcare and their dignity (Carrieri et al., 
2020). A qualitative and intersectional lens has been advised to prevent ageism in 
a pandemic, by showing that older populations are heterogeneous and pointing to 
problematic  structural  disparities  in  later  life  (SAPEA,  2019;  Swinford  et  al., 
2020).  It  has  been  criticised  that  extreme  isolation  and  other  measures  with 
strong psycho-social effects, including mental health risks, have been imposed on 
older  adults  without  their  consultation  and  respect  for  their  right  to  self-
determination,  as  well  as  without  accounting  for  their  limited  access  to  psycho-
social  services  (Azcona  et  al.,  2020).  Calls  for  pandemic  management  strategies 
based on a more nuanced understanding of vulnerability and a recognition of the 
multiple  ways  in  which  older  persons  enrich  society  have  been  made  (AGE 
Platform Europe, 2020).  

The  severity  of  COVID-19  (measured  by  hospitalisation,  admission  to  intensive 
care  units,  and  rates  of  fatality)  has  been  shown  to  be  two-fold  greater  for  men 
than  women  (Klein  et  al.,  2020).  However,  a  high  infection  risk  is  assumed  for 
women, not due to factors determined by sex, but by gender, as they constitute 
the  majority  of  care  givers  in  both  the  informal  sector  (e.g.  in  families  and 
informal  employment  for  eldercare)  and  the  formal  sector  (e.g.  as  nurses, 
teachers, community workers) (Gausman & Langer, 2020).  

In this context, it was suggested that further consideration should also be given to 
the role of children (see also section Educational inequality) in transmitting SARS-
CoV-2,  as  newer  evidence  is  inconsistent  with  first  studies  regarding  their 
contribution  to  the  spread  of  the  disease  (e.g.  Heald-Sargent  et  al.,  2020;  T.  C. 
Jones  et  al.,  2020;  Juanjuan  Zhang  et  al.,  2020).  In  addition,  recent  research 
highlights that many infected children may be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, 
and that both asymptomatic and symptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 
may shed virus for up to three weeks (DeBiasi & Delaney, 2020).  

This section sheds light on inequities in health and in the provision of health care 
and supports further examination of how universal accessibility of quality services 
for  all  can  be  strengthened.  It  has  been  suggested  that  privatisation, 
decentralisation,  short-term  planning  and  substantial  budget  cuts  have 
undermined health care systems and equality in their access (e.g. Armocida et al., 
2020; Bambra, 2013). Health inequality also persists between countries, with the

more  vulnerable  populations  of  the  globe  facing  greater  morbidity  from 
preventable and treatable causes  (WHO, 2017). The current pandemic has given 
rise  to  several  calls  for  international  cooperation  towards  universal  health 
coverage,  highlighting  the  importance  of  solidarity  in  the  distribution  of 
treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 (e.g. EGE, 2020).  

Disregard for other medical needs 

Hospitals and medical practices have also been reporting a strong decline in visits 
and  interventions  for  medical  conditions  other  than  COVID-19,  both  due  to 
cancellations on their own part and tendencies to defer consultations on the part 
of patients. Factual cancellation policies (e.g.  Søreide et al., 2020) together with 
interpretation of and communication about hospitals as a place of danger have led 
to  emergency  room  visits  falling  drastically  in  the  early  months  of  2020:  a 
worldwide  study  by  the  European  Society  of  Cardiology,  published  in  May  2020, 
found that the number of heart attack patients seeking help in emergency rooms 
has decreased by more than 50% (Pessoa-Amorim et al., 2020). 

Closure of medical offices also led to delays in preventive routine screenings and 
interruption  of  long-term  treatment  plans,  including  of  chemotherapy  for  cancer 
patients  (Cancer  Action  Network,  2020;  Maringe  et  al.,  2020;  Sharpless,  2020). 
Like other specialists, urologists have also highlighted that the strong reduction in 
elective  surgeries  might  imply  long-term  consequences  for  patients  (Morlacco  et 
al., 2020). 

Psycho-social consequences  

The  presence  and  imminent  dangers  of  a  highly  infectious  disease,  potentially 
leading  to  death,  has  psychological  effects  across  entire  societies.  So  does,  very 
likely,  also  imposed  home-confinement  (Pfefferbaum  &  North,  2020).  Previous 
pandemics  have  shown  that  psychological  reactions  can  range  from  irritability, 
fear  of  contracting  family  members,  anger,  confusion,  frustration,  loneliness  and 
denial,  through  to  anxiety,  depression,  insomnia,  despair  and  suicide  (Brooks  et 
al., 2020). Particularly prone to these effects of a pandemic are persons with pre-
existing  mental  disorders,  who  often  show  stronger  symptoms  during  and  in the 
aftermath  of  a  pandemic  due  to  higher  susceptibility  to  stress  compared  to  the 
general population (e.g. Chevance et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Patients in long-
term  care  facilities,  among  them  old  persons,  persons  with  disabilities  and 
persons with mental disorders, experience particularly stressful periods due to the 
strict  isolation  measures  implemented  in  most  caring  facilities  for  prolonged 
periods (e.g.  Boucaud-Maitre et al.,  2020;  Dubey  et  al.,  2020).  It has also been 
noted  that  persons  who  contract  the  disease  and  those  at  heightened  risk  for  it 
are  at  increased  risk  for  adverse  psycho-social  outcomes  (Pfefferbaum  &  North, 
2020).  

While  digital  information  and  communication  technologies  have  facilitated  the 
immediate  sharing  of  important  pandemic-related  information,  they  have  also 
enabled what has been termed ‘an infodemic’, contributing to ‘cyberchondria’ and

overloads  of  unfiltered  information,  often  misinformation,  resulting  in  increased 
anxiety  (Laato  et  al.,  2020,  see  also  section  The  public  response:  trust, 
communication, mis- and dis-information). 

Coupled  with  other  pandemic-related  causes  for  stress,  such  as  job  losses  and 
economic  burden,  inequalities  again  co-determine  levels  and  forms  of  psycho-
social  resilience  among  social  groups.  It  has  been  indicated  that  marginalised 
groups  can  be  particularly  susceptible  to  mental  distress  caused  by  a  pandemic 
(Dubey et al., 2020), such as homeless people who might be unable to quarantine 
and  access  basic  sanitation  facilities  and  often  have  chronic  mental  and  physical 
conditions (Tsai & Wilson, 2020), migrants who might be unable to access health 
care,  appropriate  housing  environments  or  information  in  their  languages 
(OHCHR,  IOM,  UNHCR,  &  WHO,  2020),  or  prisoners  who  might  live  amassed  in 
little  space  with  potentially  limited  access  to  information,  care,  open  spaces  and 
sanitation (Kinner et al., 2020).  

Frontline  health  care  workers  faced  with  overwork,  inadequate  protection  from 
contamination,  frustration  from  failure  to  give  optimal  patient-care  and  isolation 
have  a  high  risk  of  developing  unfavourable  mental  health  outcomes  and  may 
therefore need special attention as regards psychological support or interventions 
(Lai et al., 2020).  

Younger age-groups of children and adolescents have been described as scarcely 
affected  by  the  COVID-19  crisis,  while  age-specific  psycho-social  consequences 
both  of  the  dangers  of  an  infection  and  of  their  changing  life  conditions  during 
home confinement have received little attention (e.g. Wang et al., 2020). UNICEF 
has reported about the need to nuance pandemics policies affecting children and 
warned against family priorities potentially shifting away from childcare in times of 
crisis and hardship, with education and health care for children being at particular 
risk in disadvantaged contexts and regions (Richardson et al., 2020). It has been 
highlighted  that  children  with  developmental  disabilities,  already  a  particularly 
vulnerable group, are at increased risk during pandemics as they often have more 
significant healthcare, mental and educational needs and depend on community-
based  services,  which  are  potentially  more  difficult  to  provide  during  pandemics 
(Aishworiya & Kang, 2020). 

Insufficient  importance  has  been  attributed  to  mental  health  in  disadvantaged 
groups  during  the  current  pandemic,  pointing  to  the  need  “to  understand  how 
changes  in  social  and  welfare  policies,  reinforced  community  initiatives  (e.g. 
mutual  aid  groups),  and  improved  family  supports  and  social  networks,  can 
transform  the  experience  of  the  most  vulnerable,  and  modify  the  effects  of  this 
pandemic,  and  anything  similar  in  future,  on  mental  health”  (Morgan  &  Rose, 
2020;(cid:2)see also Holmes et al., 2020).

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

China,  where  it  first  led  to  an  epidemic,  has  spurred  increased  racism  against 
people  of  Asian  descent  and  appearance  across  the  globe.  Similar  scapegoating 
occurred in the context of other pandemics and epidemics, with people linking the 
disease to an imagined origin.  

When  the  bubonic  plague spread  in  San  Francisco  in  1900,  for instance,  Chinese 
residents were quarantined in Chinatown, while white merchants could leave the 
area (Barde, 2004 in Gover et al., 2020). In the context of the SARS epidemic in 
2007,  a  surge  of  risk  and  blame  discourses  in  New  York  City's  Chinatown  was 
registered,  despite  an  absence  of  infections  in  the  area  (Eichelberger,  2007).  As 
Wuhan experienced an intense spread of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020, officials and 
journalists  quickly  named  it  “the  Chinese  virus”  (e.g.  Viala-Gaudefroy  & 
Lindaman, April 2020);9 prejudiced comments about Chinese socio-cultural habits 
went viral on social media (Chung & Li, 2020; Shimizu, 2020);10 and entire lists of 
hate crimes motivated by COVID-19-related Sinophobia have been published.11 

It  has  also  been  argued  that  such  stigmatisation  and  shame  potentially  cause 
PTSD, anxiety or depression (Gover et al., 2020) and prevent carriers of the virus 
from reporting their condition and receiving timely health-care attention (Chung & 
Li,  2020).  Racist  sentiments  and  ‘politics  of  fear’  may  moreover  hinder 
international  cooperation  in  governance,  trade  and  finance,  and  impede 
coordination and solidarity, critical in the management of pandemic crises (Dubey 
et al., 2020).  

At  the  same  time,  the  pandemic  has  been  reported  to  catalyse  anti-racist 
movements,  for  example  among  Chinese  immigrants  and  their  descendants  in 
France,  “who  have  broken  their  silence,  united”  against  discrimination  and 
denialism of anti-Asian racism in France (Wang et al., 2020).

unemployment and poverty rates.  

involved  partial  to  complete 

In  April  2020,  the  European  Trade  Union  Confederation  reported  that  the 
unemployment  rate  increased  by  at  least  4  million,  while  7  million  contract 
employees were forced into so-called short-time work schemes as a result of the 
COVID-19.12  While  office  workers  could  more easily  transition  to  flexible  working 
arrangements,  industrial,  tourism,  retail  and  transport  workers  faced  job  loss  or 
reduction in working hours due to decreased demand  (Pak et al., 2020). Several 
reports estimate that the most disadvantaged sections of the working population, 
such as gig workers, migrant workers, women,  old workers, sick workers, young 
professionals, artists, culture professionals and under-protected self-employed will 
be impacted the most (Fana et al., 2020; ILO, 2020a), especially in countries with 
weak  social  protection  systems.  To  bring one  example,  in  Austria  in  March  2020 
one  in  seven  persons  with  lower  education  levels  (less  than  nine  years  of 
schooling) have lost their employment (Kittel et al., 2020; Pichler et al., 2020(cid:3)(cid:4)).  

Globally,  49  million  individuals  might  fall  into  extreme  poverty  in  2020,  as  has 
been concluded in the context of a study about the effects of the current crisis on 
poor communities across four continents (Buheji et al., 2020) (see also Figure 3). 
The  World  Bank  expects  11  million  people  to  be  driven  into  poverty  across  East 
Asia and the Pacific (World Bank, 2020). The ILO estimates that almost 1.6 billion 
informal  economy  workers,  out  of  a  total  global  workforce  of  3.3  billion,  “have 
suffered massive damage to their capacity to earn a living” (ILO, 2020b).

Figure 3: The impact of COVID-19 on global extreme poverty 

Extreme  poverty  is  measured  as  the  number  of  people  living  on  less  than  $1.90  per  day 
(used with permission from Lakner et al., 2020, modified from Mahler et al., 2020).14 

The  pandemic-induced  economic  crisis  is  expected  to  deepen  the  uneven 
development at multiple geographical scales. While the Global North/Global South 
divide  is  likely  to  increase,  Europe  is  predicted  to  also  see  a  worsening  of  its 
protracted north/south and its east/west disparities (Sokol & Pataccini, 2020). The 
OECD  forecasts a wave of bankruptcies and job losses to severely aggravate the 
pre-existing  structural  weaknesses  of  South-East  European  economies  and 
particularly  warns  from  the  pandemic’s  effects  on  what  already  are  worrisome 
rates of youth unemployment in the region (OECD, 2020a). With the interruption 
of international travels Eastern European seasonal workers initially stayed in their 
home  countries  or  returned  to  them,  for  many  meaning  a  loss  of  their  main 
income  source  –  until  several  countries  relying  on  this  work  force,  mostly  in  the 
agriculture,  health  care  and  eldercare  sectors,  negotiated  travel  exemptions  for 
migrant  workers.  Romanian  researchers  reported  that  “several  thousand 
Romanians who were ‘needed’ abroad – many from the poorer regions that were 
already  hardest  hit  by  COVID-19  –  crammed  onto  buses  and  planes  (with  little 
social  distancing)  to  board  flights  to  Germany.  (…)  [I]n  total  188  specially 
chartered  flights  left  Romania  for  western  European  countries  at  a  time  when 
scheduled  flights  were  suspended,”  (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:9) (cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9) (cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19),  when  citizens  of 
destination  countries  were  under  protection  regimes  of  a  higher  level,  and  when 
having weak health protection as migrant workers in host countries put both them 
and others in contact with them at greater risk (e.g. Liem et al., 2020).

Economists  calculated  that  in  June  Greece  faced  an  unemployment  rate  12% 
higher than it would have been without the health crisis, likely to be explained by 
a slowdown of seasonal hiring in tourism in Mediterranean countries (Betcherman 
et  al.,  2020).  The  tourism  crisis  together  with  Southern  Europe’s  strong 
dependency  on  small  businesses,  struggling  more  than  large  ones  during  the 
lockdown, have led the IMF to forecast that unemployment rates are expected to 
peak  in  2020  at  over  20%  in  Spain  and  Greece,  14%  in  Portugal,  and  13%  in 
Italy, compared to, for example, 4% in Germany (IMF, April 2020).15 

Despite  efforts  of  many  governments  and  international  organisations  to  provide 
emergency  social  security  measures,  such  as  unemployment  compensation  for 
those  affected  by  job  loss,16  a  critique  of  such  policies  is  that  they  have  often 
disregarded  necessary  structural  considerations  about  pre-existing  social 
inequalities  (e.g.  Kelman,  2020;  Patel  et  al.,  2020).  This  should  also  include 
considerations  about  the  often  underestimated  number  of  informal  workers  in 
Europe, who do not have access to special financial support measures provided by 
governments  to  businesses  and  employees  (Williams  &  Kayaoglu,  2020),  as well 
as homeless people, unregistered people and others who are unable or unqualified 
to  apply  for  state  support.  In  response  to  their  precarious  situation,  social 
movements,  such  as  activism  for  housing  security,  have  increased  during  the 
pandemic, as is for example reported from Lisbon, by “capitalising on the visibility 
for the right to housing, as a basic human right and an unconditional public health 
imperative”  (Mendes,  2020).  It  may  be  that  people  in  difficult  circumstances 
disregard  what  may  seem  as  more  uncertain  risks  related  to  the  pandemic  in 
relation  to  what  may  seem  as  more  real  risks  related  to  their  livelihoods  (e.g. 
Bambra et al., 2020), with various implications as regards nuanced planning and 
communication  about  special  measures  and  compliance  with  them  during 
pandemics.  

Economic  and  labour  disparities  in  the  experience  of  a  pandemic  interact  with 
other factors shaping inequalities. Figures show that in the USA citizens of Asian 
and South-American background experienced almost twice the overall increase in 
unemployment; jobless rates of workers with lower levels of education (without a 
high  school  diploma)  grew  to  6.8%,  the  highest  percentage  in  three  years;  and 
the rate for women is 0.2 percentage point higher than the one for men (Burns, 
April 2020).17 Another study found that already in the first month of the pandemic 
over 57% of women making less than $30,000 have lost income; and that 42% of

non-white  workers  reported  losing  income,  compared  to  just  26%  of  white 
workers  in  the  same  income  bracket  (Bertrand  et  al,  April  2020).18  A  UK  survey 
showed  that  “women  were  96%  more  likely  than  men  to  have  been  made 
redundant because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 8.6% of women reporting job 
loss during lockdown compared to 4.4% of men”  (Oreffice & Quintana-Domeque, 
2020).  The  gender  gap  in  job  losses  has  been  explained  by  women’s  larger 
representation  in  the  hardest-hit  sectors,  such  as  hospitality,  retail,  health  care, 
schools and the arts (e.g. ILO, 2020a; Kochhar & Barroso, 202019). 

Gender inequality 

Beyond  findings  about  the  effects  of  structural  health  inequality  for  women  in 
pandemics  (as  described  in  the  section  Health  inequalities),  it  has  become  clear 
that broader considerations about how  gender  roles  determine  the  experience  of 
societal  changes  during  a  health  crisis  are  important  cornerstones  of  any  well-
developed  response  strategy  (Azcona  et al., 2020). Nevertheless, as has already 
been  found  in  analyses  of  the  Ebola  and  Zika  crises,  gender  experts  tend  to  be 
excluded from public health interventions and gender components remain ignored 
(Davies & Bennett, 2016). A recent UN Women report warns about the COVID-19 
crisis  exacerbating  gender  inequality  and  derailing  the  hard-won  progress  on 
equality (Azcona et al., 2020).  

Research has shown that the burdens carried by women cumulate and potentially 
escalate during an emergency situation, as they take up care-taking, community 
and  home  schooling  responsibilities,  often  without  the  alleviation  of  their 
professional activities (McLaren et al., 2020), or while losing their jobs. According 
to a study involving a sample representative of the UK population as regards age, 
sex  and  ethnicity,  between  February  and  June  2020  British  women  have 
experienced a reduction of their work hours 50% more than men, while they have 
increased  their  hours  spent  with  unpaid  housework  and  childcare  (195%  more 
childcare  and  home  schooling  hours  than  men,  and  48%  hours  more  in 
housework)  (Oreffice  &  Quintana-Domeque,  2020).  Responding  to  an  Austrian 
survey in May 2020, almost half of all mothers, but less than a third of all fathers 
indicated  that  they  spend  considerably  more  time  with  child  care  (Kittel  et  al., 
2020; Berghammer, May 202020). German researchers also reported that women

often seem to carry most of  the  cognitive  burden  of  childcare  during  the  current 
pandemic, while men mostly mentioned concerns over paid work (Czymara et al., 
2020).  A  representative  Dutch  survey,  however,  showed  that  22%  of  fathers 
engage  in  more  care  tasks  than  before,  and  17%  in  more  household  work, 
potentially  suggesting  the  crisis  as  a  moment  that  could  also  facilitate  a  more 
egalitarian division of care taking and household work in the future (Yerkes et al., 
2020).  

Pandemics also highlight that a great percentage of essential work is provided by 
women, most centrally in child care, eldercare and health care. While this exposes 
them to increased risk during a health crisis (see section Health inequalities), it is 
not  appropriately  or  not  at  all  remunerated  (Craig,  April  202021;  EGE,  2018).  As 
has  been  described  (see  section  Economic  hardship),  women  are  moreover  at 
higher  risk  of  income  loss  than  men  during  lockdowns,  leading  to  a  downstream 
effect  of  increased  dependence  (Ryan  &  El  Ayadi,  2020).  Reports  have  also 
indicated  that  psychological  and  relational  effects  of  home  confinement  and 
physical  isolation  can  result  in  an  increase  of  domestic  sexual  and  gender-based 
violence  (ibid.).  UN  Women  reported  that  in  France  calls  to  domestic  violence 
helplines rose 32% (Azcona et al., 2020). A large German study found that 3% of 
women  experienced  physical  violence  during  confinement,  with  even  higher 
percentages  in  families  that  faced  financial  hardship  (Steinert  &  Ebert,  June 
2020).22  Risk  factors  associated  with  domestic  violence  are  exacerbated  by  the 
current  policies  of  home  confinement  and  social  isolation,  while  access  to  help 
services is compromised during a pandemic (Moreira & Pinto da Costa, 2020).  

Educational inequality 

The  closure  of  schools  was  also  acknowledged  as  a  worrisome  interruption  of 
structured learning and development for children. Lockdowns have urged schools 
to organise online teaching where possible, often despite a lack of necessary skills 
and infrastructure. In a recent OECD survey, only two out of three teachers said 
that  they  could  support  student  learning  through  the  use  of  digital  technology, 
one  in  four  school  principals  reported  a  shortage  or  inadequacy  of  digital 
technology,  and  one  in  five  schools  reported  insufficient  Internet  access  (OECD, 
2020b).  A  large  body  of  research  has  moreover  established  that  the  relational 
aspects  of  education,  including  both  direct  pupil-to-teacher  contact  and  direct 
contact  among  pupils,  play  a  key  role  in  personal  and  cognitive  development,

especially in younger children (e.g. Hawkins et al., 2012; Silverman et al., 2020; 
Stodel, Thompson, & MacDonald, 2006). 

A sudden shift to home-schooling also created new burdens for parents, becoming 
a  key  resource  for  the  provision  of  education  and  their  children’s  home 
environments  a  key  factor  co-determining  their  learning  experience.  In  this 
context,  research  about  the  effects  of  school  closures  due  to  natural  disasters, 
war  or  strikes  made  clear  previously  that  learning  loss  in  periods  of  unexpected 
school closures is high (e.g. Belot & Webbink, 2010). Several recent surveys seem 
to  confirm  this,  indicating  that  all  pupils  are  behind  with  respect  to  their 
2019/2020  school  curriculum,  with  children  from  disadvantaged  households 
struggling  the  most  with  distance  learning  (e.g.  Graham  &  Sahlberg,  March 
202023; Sharp et al., 2020). A UK study concluded that children in richer families 
are  spending  more  time  with  educational  activities  than  those  from  the  poorer 
families  consulted,  with  the  overall  difference  exceeding  one  hour  per  day 
(Andrew  et  al.,  2020).  In  poorer  families  the  availability  of  digital  infrastructure 
and devices might be limited and parents might face increased economic hardship 
and  psycho-social  stress  hindering  them  to  support  the  home-schooling  of  their 
children (Graham & Sahlberg, March 2020),24 whereas better-off parents might be 
able to afford private tuition and receive stronger support from more resourceful 
schools (Andrew et al., 2020). A Dutch survey found that higher educated parents 
perceive  themselves  as  more  capable  to  home  school  their  children  than  do 
parents  with  lower  education  degrees  (Bol,  2020).  Danish  researchers  studied 
library  take-outs  and  similarly  concluded  that  better  educated,  richer  and  non-
immigrant parents were more successful in using libraries to support their home 
schooling  (Jæger  &  Blaabæk,  2020).  School  closures  are  hence  likely  to  further 
deepen socio-educational divides (Blundell et al., 2020).  

It  is  clear  that  educational  quality  and  conditions  for  home  schooling  also  differ 
among poorer and wealthier countries and regions, and it has also been assumed 
that  families  in  Eastern  and  Southern  Europe,  where  more  patriarchal  gender 
norms prevail, might be less likely to adapt labour division equitably, with women 
suffering more from the cumulating workload (Blaskó et al., 2020).  

It has therefore been suggested that mandatory school closure policies to limit the 
spread  of  SARS-CoV-2  be  carefully  considered  in  light  of  both  the  available 
evidence  about  their  public  health  benefit  and  the  established  evidence  about 
their long-term implications for child development (Silverman et al., 2020).

Countering inequalities as part of preparedness and 
response strategies: conclusions 

This  chapter  shows  how  pandemics  and  other  health  crises  affect  population 
groups  in  different  ways.  First  studies  on  this  in  the  context  of  COVID-19  and 
research about previous epidemics and pandemics indicate that health crises and 
measures  taken  to  mitigate  harm  and  risks  often  hit  disadvantaged  members  of 
society the hardest.  

This is supported by knowledge from disasters research more broadly. As with all 
disasters  and  crises  in  which  a  hazard,  in  this  case  a  virus,  becomes  associated 
with  major  societal  disruption,  the  concept  of  vulnerability  applies  not  just  to 
direct  contact  with  the  hazard  itself  but  to  the  indirect  societal  consequences  of 
the  damage  and  disruption  brought  by  the  hazard  (Few  et  al.,  2020).  Disasters 
research  shows  that  these  are  multiple,  interacting,  dynamic  and  often  long-
duration,  with  long-term  implications  especially  for  the  most  vulnerable  social 
groups.  In  some  cases,  this  heightened  vulnerability  may  not  become  manifest 
immediately but emerges through time (e.g. Hicks & Few, 2015).  

Policies  and  practices  of  pandemic  management  –  if  viewed  through  a  lens  of 
equitability  –  would  therefore  be  focussed  on  understanding,  anticipating, 
monitoring  and  minimising  the  impact  of  the  crisis  especially  on  those  highly 
vulnerable  groups  (Few  et  al.,  2020).  Among  the  social  determinants  of 
vulnerabilities  are  age,  gender,  ethnicity  and  employment  and  socio-economic 
status,  as  this  chapter  shows.  They  often  interact,  which  calls  for  intersectional 
perspectives on cumulative disadvantage.  

Pandemic preparedness and management plans would therefore need to address 
the  multi-faceted  nature  and  myriad  consequences  of  pandemics  and  build  on 
respective  long-term  considerations.  As  this  chapter  indicates,  addressing 
inequality  in  institutional  and  legal  structures  would  be  critical.  Crisis  resilience 
and  preparedness  root  in  societal  institutions  of  solidarity  and  sustainable  long-
term planning towards stronger equity.

4.  CAPACITY AND ORGANISATION OF PUBLIC 

HEALTH SYSTEMS 

European countries hold primary responsibility for organising and delivering health 
services  and  medical  care.  Therefore,  the  European  countries  and  their  national 
(public)  health  systems  play  a  major  role  in  the  management  of  epidemics.  EU 
policy serves to complement national policies. 

National  health  systems  are  varied  and  reflect  different  societal  and  political 
choices.  Nevertheless,  the  Council  of  the  European  Union  named  universality, 
access to good quality care, equity, and solidarity as common values.25  Still,  the 
analysis of differences between the health systems of different European countries 
is complex.26  

Public health spending amounts to about 15% of total government expenditure in 
the EU, but it varies from about 7% to over 20% between EU member countries.27 
Health  care  systems  have  to  face  increased  expenditure  due  to  the  aging  of  the 
population, the increase of diet and lifestyle related conditions, and technological 
advances.  At  the  same  time,  countries  have  tried  to  reduce  health  care 
expenditure,  in  particular  after  the  2008/09  financial  crisis.  This  has  left  the 
health  sector  in  many  countries  to  operate  at  close  to  100%,  leaving  little  room 
for crisis response (Legido-Quigley et al., 2020; Devi, 2020).  

The  communication  of  the  European  Commission  on  effective,  accessible  and 
resilient  health  systems  (COM/2014/0215)  calls  for  stable  funding  mechanisms, 
sound  risk  adjustment  methods,  good  governance,  strengthening  of  information 
flows, adequate costing and a health work force of adequate capacity in order to 
improve  the  resilience  of  health  systems.  The  scientific  opinion  “Adaptation  to 
health  effects  of  climate  change  in  Europe”28  called  on  the  EU  to  increase  its 
support for the health sector to make it more resilient.

Pandemic preparedness plans 

In  Europe,  adequate  preparedness  for  pandemics  is  a  national  obligation  under 
the International Health Regulations (2005) and the EU Decision on serious cross-
border  threats  to  health  (1082/2013/EU).  National  preparedness  for  pandemics 
relies  to  a  considerable  extent  on  national  pandemics  plans.  The  WHO  provides 
guidance  on  the  development  of  such  plans.  The  guidance  states  that  at  the 
country  level  “pandemic  preparedness  should  be  seen  as  an  integral  part  of 
preparedness  to  threats  to  human  health  caused  by  any  emergency,  e.g. 
outbreaks  of  any  disease  or  the  occurrence  of  natural  disasters  or  chemical 
incidents”.29  Still,  most  guidance  focuses  on  influenza  pandemics,  and  uses  the 
terms “pandemics” and “influenza pandemics” interchangeably.30 In consequence, 
national  pandemic  preparedness  plans  (often  called  Pandemic  Influenza  Plans) 
also  focus  on  influenza  pandemics.  In  spring  2020  these  plans  needed  to  be 
adapted to the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic. One example of such a 
need for adaptation was that, as guidance advised against confinement measures, 
no  communication  was  foreseen  to  reduce  panic  buying  in  anticipation  of 
confinement  measures  (Ghanchi,  2020).  All  European  countries  have  developed 
such plans, but only 13 countries have revised the plans following the 2009 H1N1 
influenza epidemic.  

Capacity of health systems to respond to pandemics 

The  resilience  of  health  systems  was  defined  by  the  European  Observatory  on 
Health  Systems  and  Policies  as  “…the  ability  to  prepare  for,  manage  (absorb, 
adapt  and  transform)  and  learn  from  shocks  such  as  pandemics”.31  In  a  related 
policy  brief,  preparedness  is  discussed  in  function  of  four  key  health  system 
functions: governance, financing, resources and service delivery.  

There are different ways to assess the performance and preparedness of national 
health systems. All countries have committed to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) 
by  2030,  as  part  of  the  UN  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development.32  This 
includes  financial  risk  protection,  access  to  quality  essential  health-care  services 
and  access  to  safe,  effective,  quality  and  affordable  essential  medicines  and 
vaccines for all. The UHC service index (Figure 4) is one of the indicators for the 
sustainable  development  goals  (Lozano  et  al.,  2020).  In  Europe  the  United

The Global Health Security (GHS)  Index, first published in 2019, is more specific

related  capabilities  of  countries  that  make  up  the  States  Parties  to  the 
International  Health  Regulations  (IHR,  2005).34  The  countries  in  the  category

Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, Thailand, and Sweden (Figure 5).

In contrast, among 21 countries analysed, England, Wales and Spain experienced 
the  highest  death  toll  during  the  first  COVID-19  wave  in  terms  of  excess  deaths 
relative  to  the  population  (Kontis  et  al.,  2020).  It  appears  that  high  scores  for 
preparedness  indices  have  not  necessarily  protected  countries  from  developing 
severe  epidemics;  some  of  the  best-prepared  countries  have  among  the  higher 
numbers of infections and deaths relative to the size of the population. Abbey et 
al. (2020) compared the GHS index to the performance of countries with respect 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, and found an overestimation of  the preparedness  of 
some  countries  scoring  highly  on  the  GHS  index  and  underestimation  of  the 
preparedness  of  other  countries  with  relatively  lower  scores  on  the  GHS  index 
(Abbey  et  al.,  2020).  Discrepancies  can  be  caused  by  some  deficits  in  the 
weighting  of  categories  and  the  sources  of  data  utilised  by  the  expert  panel, 
putting  too  little  emphasis  on  testing  and  adaptability  of  health  systems.35  For

example,  the  United  States  scored  well  in  the  2019  category  “Testing  and 
reporting”, but took much longer than South Korea and Germany to start testing 
the  population.  The  fact  that  the  GHS  panel  evaluated  information  provided  by 
each  country,  instead  of  engaging  directly  with  the  responsible  authorities,  has 
the  potential  to  obscure  crucial  weaknesses  in  a  country's  capacity  to  confront 
outbreaks  (Abbey  et  al.  2020).  Some  Asian  countries  performed  better  than 
expected  because  their  experience  with  SARS  taught  them  to  react  swiftly  and 
effectively. For other countries performing well the authors cite extensive testing, 
rapid monitoring and effectively enforced quarantine and isolation mechanisms as 
contributing  to  an  effective  response.  Beyond  health  care  system  preparedness, 
political  decisions  play  a  central  role  in  shaping  the  response  to  epidemic 
outbreaks. 

The  Global  Preparedness  Monitoring  Board  (GPMB)  aims  to  assess  the  world’s 
ability  to  protect  itself  from  health  emergencies  and  identify  critical  gaps  to 
preparedness  across  multiple  perspectives.  In  2018,  only  one  third  of  countries 
had the capacities required under the IHG (GPMB, 2019).  

The institute for Public Policy Research, a UK think tank, published an analysis36 of 
why  the  United  Kingdom’s  health  and  care  system  struggled  to  cope  with  the 
pandemic and suggested what can be improved. It reported that the pandemic did 
not  only  cause  many  casualties  directly,  but  also  imperilled  regular  health  care 
like ‘non-urgent’ operations and cancer treatments. This resulted in high numbers 
of excess deaths of causes other than COVID-19. The authors trace the difficulties 
back  to  decisions  taken  in  response  to  the  2008/09  financial  crash,  aimed  at 
providing  the  same  with  less  resources.  This  caused  a  lack  of  capacity  (e.g. 
hospital  bed  numbers),  staffing,  and  equipment  such  as  scanners,  digital 
modernisation  and  sustainable  funding.  The  authors  present  proposals  to 
strengthen  capacity,  as  well  as  to  improve  population  health  and  reduce  health 
inequalities. Their suggestions include  increased staffing,  increased resources for 
digital modernisation and sustainable funding of health and social care. Improving 
the  general  health  of  the population  (e.g.  by  combating  obesity,  alcohol  use  and 
smoking,  meeting  vaccine  coverage,  better  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  cancer) 
and  reducing  health  inequalities  are  expected  to  make  the  population  more 
resilient to disease outbreaks.  

Organisation of public health systems 

With  the  outbreak  of  a  pandemic  health  systems  need  to  transform  rapidly, 
shifting to emergency response, while maintaining quality health care provision in 
all fields. When the number of infections grows exponentially each day of delay in 
the response may have tragic consequences. Having the ability to respond is not 
the same thing as actually doing so; the political and policy context are crucial.

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

Financial management of the response to pandemics requires, next to adequately 
funded  health  systems,  flexibility  and  the  possibility  to  re-programme  existing 
expenditures  toward  the  health  care  response.  Being  able  to  do  so  depends  on 
systems that define rules and regulations for budget allocation and spending—the 
public financial management system. In France and the Netherlands, for example, 
such rules are adaptable and funds can be re-programmed rapidly.37 

Laboratory capabilities are crucial for managing a pandemic. The European Centre 
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published a comparison of values for a 
composite index of national public health laboratory capacities as of 2016. France, 
the  United  Kingdom,  Sweden  and  Belgium  were  among  the  countries  with  the 
highest  scores,  scoring  significantly  higher  than  Germany,  for  example,  which 
ranked only 18th amongst European countries (ECDC, 2018a). However, Germany 
reacted rapidly in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was one of the 
first countries to develop a diagnostic test developed at Berlin’s Charité hospital, 
and the government mobilised both public and private laboratories to rapidly scale 
up  testing  capacity.  In  February,  the  German  government  mandated  that  all 
insurance  companies  pay  for  COVID-19  tests,  thereby  motivating  private 
laboratories to scale up quickly (Wieler et al., 2020). Being able to test on a large 
scale  also  made  it  possible  to  test  asymptomatic  people  and  gain  a  better 
understanding  and  control  of  the  epidemic.  Germany  decided  to  do  the  latter 
already  in  May  2020,  well  before  the  WHO  revised  its  guidance  to  include  the 
information  that  people  without  symptoms  can  also  infect  others.38  Germany’s 
successful  testing  schemes  were  thus  enabled  not  only  by  intrinsic  capacities  of 
the public health system but also by strategic decisions taken at an early stage.

5.  PUBLIC HEALTH AND RESPONSE MANAGEMENT 

Prevention and early detection 

Net  benefits  of  stopping  pandemics  before  they  start  are  likely  to  be  enormous 
(Dobson et al., 2020). The emergence of a new infectious disease itself cannot be 
predicted  or  controlled  –  for  example,  it  is  impossible  to  avoid  the  circulation  of 
coronaviruses in the wild, in the sylvatic cycle  (Frutos et al., 2020). However, an 
alignment  of  drivers  which  together  risk  leading  to  an  epidemic,  and  which  are 
largely social and ecological, is largely known. This offers possibilities of improved 
early detection and prevention (ibid.).  

Available  evidence  suggests  the  need  to  broaden  the  focus  beyond  known 
pandemic  threats  (such  as  influenza)  and  to  place  much  more  emphasis  on 
anticipating  and  preparing  to  stop  the  next  emerging  pandemics  at  their  origin 
(Frutos  et  al.,  2020;  McCloskey  et  al.,  2014;  UNEP,  2020).  Past  failures  to 
anticipate  epidemics  despite  prior  investments  in  research,  surveillance  and 
pathogen  discovery  (as  was  the  case  for  the  Zika  virus;  Stephen,  2020)  also 
suggests  the  need  to  extend  the  surveillance  and  anticipation  of  much  broader 
social and ecological risk factors (ibid.), which are non-linear and involve complex 
systemic relationships (UNEP, 2020). A core implication of that finding is the need 
for  global  collaboration  for  sharing  and  making  sense  of  such  complex 
interdisciplinary  intelligence  and  translating  it  into  early  warnings  (Stephen, 
2020). 

The  alignment  of  high-risk  factors  often  occurs  in  low-income  countries,  which 
typically  lack  the  necessary  resources,  e.g.  for  local  surveillance  and  laboratory 
diagnostics (see Lee et al., 2020), but also for identifying socio-ecological changes 
in  community  vulnerability  (Stephen,  2020).  Hence  the 
for 
international policy (including e.g. EU development and aid policies) is to support 
those countries in implementing the first layer of local preventive measures (Pak 
et al., 2020).

Insights from COVID-19 on biomedical countermeasures 

Accelerating  the  biomedical  response  to  pandemics  (diagnostics,  vaccines  and 
treatments)  is  of  crucial  importance  –  and  a  lesson  from  the  Ebola  epidemic 
(Simpson et al., 2020). Rapid biomedical response requires overcoming numerous 
crucial  barriers  in  research,  clinical  trials,  and  manufacturing  (Simpson  et  al., 
2020; Wolf et al., 2020). Positive steps in that direction are already being taken. 
They  include  the  WHO’s  Research  and  Development  Blueprint  to  decrease  the 
time for development, assessment, and authorisation of medical countermeasures 
for  the  world’s  most  dangerous  pathogens.  In  the  USA  the  Biomedical  Advanced 
Research and Development Authority (BARDA) supports the transition of medical 
countermeasures  from  research  to  FDA  approval  and  use.  BARDA’s  activities 
include  funding,  technical  support  and  services  ranging  from  a  clinical  support 
network  to  a  fill-finish  manufacturing  network.  As  applied  specifically  to  COVID-

19,  the  recent  EU-supported  Access  to  COVID-19  Tools  (ACT)  Accelerator,39  is 
also a positive example.  

There  are  many  elements  of  accelerating  medical  preparedness  for  future 
pandemic  threats  which  do  not  vary  depending  on  specific  epidemiology  and 
pathophysiology  and  therefore  can  be  developed  across  pathogens  (Simpson  et 
al., 2020). However, there is a high likelihood that future pandemics (’Disease X’) 
will be caused by the ‘Pathogen X’ archetype of a highly virulent RNA virus (ibid.) 
as is SARS-CoV-2. 

Transmission of the disease and consequences for 
protective measures 

At  the  onset  of  the  pandemic,  very  little  was  known  about  the  way  the  new 
pathogen,  SARS-CoV-2,  is  transmitted.  In  this  situation  it  was  difficult  for 
scientists to confidently make strong public health recommendations.  

Known health risk mitigation measures applied by governments in pandemics thus 
far include lockdowns, quarantines, mobility and travel restrictions, restrictions on 
social  and  economic  activities  (such  as  retail,  schools),  physical  distancing 
measures,  hygienic  measures  including  mask  wearing,  diagnostic  testing, 
temperature screening, contact tracing, as well as communication and community 
engagement measures (Bruinen de Bruin et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Webster, 
2020). Yet, in order to define  and implement effective  non-medical public health 
risk mitigation measures it is essential to first clarify possible modes of infection. 

Pathways of transmission 

Infectious  agents  can  be  transmitted  in  a  number  of  ways,  such  as  by  sexual 
intercourse  (e.g.  HIV  and  many  others),  blood  (e.g.  hepatitis  B),  insects  (e.g. 
dengue,  Zika,  malaria),  faecal  contamination,  food  or  close  contact  (e.g.  Ebola). 
Respiratory,  or  airborne,  transmission  is  an  important  and  efficient  way  for 
spreading  bacterial  and  viral  infections  like  tuberculosis,  measles,  and  chicken 
pox.  

Infections  with  airborne  transmission  spread  by  exposure  to  pathogen-
transporting  droplets  and  aerosols  emitted  by  infected  persons.  The  majority  of 
aerosols are 1–10(cid:2)(cid:20)m in diameter and can linger in the air for a long time. These 
viruses transported with the aerosols may be able to infect people who are further 
away  from  the  infected  person  or  after  that  person  has  left  the  space  (Peeples, 
2020). There is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through 
aerosols  (Setti  et  al.,  2020).  SARS-CoV-2  was  also  shown  to  remain  viable  and 
infectious  in  aerosols  for  hours  (van  Doremalen  et  al.,  2020).  As  a  consequence

SARS-CoV-2  may  spread  over  larger  distances  (up  to  10  m)  and  can  linger  for 
longer times, for hours instead of minutes (Setti et al., 2020).  

The  insights  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  regarding  its  transmission  and  the 
prevention thereof, summarised below, hold for future infectious diseases which, 
similarly to SARS-CoV-2, can be transmitted through aerosols. 

Physical  distancing  and  avoidance  of  crowds  will  reduce  airborne  transmission. 
While for COVID-19 the recommendations for social distancing range from 1 m to 
2 m in different countries, there are scientific reports about people with COVID-19 
who infected others who were more than 1,8 m away or entered the space shortly 
after  the  infected  person  had  left.  These  transmissions  occurred  within  enclosed 
spaces  that  had  inadequate  ventilation,  sometimes  linked  with  heavy  breathing. 
Under  such  circumstances,  the  amount  of  infectious  aerosols  can  become 
concentrated  enough  to  spread  the  virus  to  other  people  (CDC  website:  How 
COVID-19  spreads).40  The  finding  that  the  virus  can  be  spread  through  airborne 
transmission,  which  increases  the  risk  of  infection  in  closed  spaces,  raises 
particular concerns for the colder season. 

In  the  early  phase  of  the  COVID-19  outbreak  there  was  limited  data  on  the 
effectiveness  of  facemasks  for  reducing  the  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2.  It  was 
suggested that people should be encouraged to wear face masks in application of 
the  precautionary  principle.  Even  a  small  reduction  in  the  number  of  new 
infections  could  make  a  major  difference  to  the  burden  on  the  health  systems 
(e.g. for the availability of hospital bed space, in particular in intensive care units 
and regarding ventilators). 

More rigorous analyses added direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of face 
masks,  including  from  animal  studies,  which  can  better  exclude  confounding 
variables.  This  available  science  supports  using  masks.  Recent studies show that 
they  do  not  only  diminish  the  chances  of  both  transmitting  and  contracting  the 
coronavirus,  but  may  also  reduce  the  severity  of  infection,  if  people  do  contract 
the  disease,  by  reducing  the  virus  dose  a  person  might  receive  (Peeples,  2020). 
Generally,  wearing  masks  and  physical  distancing  have  proven  to  be  effective 
counter measures (Loewenthal et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020). 

A  variety  of  masks  are  used  by  the  public,  and  the  data  on  effectiveness  of  the 
different  types  of  masks  are  often  statistically  underpowered  and  contradictory, 
which  leads  to  confusion  in  policy-makers  and  citizens  who  are  interpreting  and 
understanding the evidence differently (Peeples, 2020). This may also undermine 
the  willingness  of  the  public  to  wear  masks.  Optimal  materials,  thickness 
(including  number  of  layers)  and  fit  of  masks,  as  well  as  durability  and  washing 
requirements need to be determined and solutions should be found for problems 
such as poor filtration and moisture retention (Greenhalgh et al., 2020). Also the

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

effects  of  mask  wearing  on  human  behaviour  needs  to  be  better  understood: 
some  evidence  suggests  that  wearing  a  face  mask  might  drive  the  wearer  and 
surrounding people to also adhere more strictly to other measures, such as social 
distancing  (Marchiori,  2020),  while  there  are  other  studies  indicating  that  people 
wearing  masks  may  feel  ‘too’  safe  and  increase  other  risk-associated  behaviour 
(Luckman  et  al.,  2020).  Face  masks  are  worn  frequently  in  several  East  Asian 
countries to prevent spread of respiratory diseases, starting with the Spanish flu a 
century ago. Research on social and psychological aspects of mask wearing would 
also  be  useful  for  controlling  other  diseases,  which  are  spread  by  airborne 
transmission,  such  as  influenza.  In  addition,  further  education  of  the  public  is 
needed to explain how to wear and handle masks (Peeples, 2020). 

As it cannot be known which pathogen will cause the next pandemic, and how it 
will be transmitted, it is advisable to ensure that a sufficient quantity of masks is 
always available or can be produced on short notice, for instance by repurposing 
manufacturing capacity. Wearing masks is a simple, cheap, and effective measure 
during pandemics with airborne transmission with a  comparably small impact  on 
social and economic life. 

In  addition  to  wearing  masks  and  distancing  measures,  ventilation  makes  a 
difference. Evidence warrants engineering controls targeting airborne transmission 
as  part  of  an  overall  strategy  to  limit  infection  risk  indoors.  Appropriate  building 
engineering  controls,  which  can  often  be  easily  implemented  and  without  much 
cost,  include  sufficient  and  effective  ventilation,  possibly  enhanced  by  particle 
filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding 
(Morawska  et  al.,  2020).  It  has  been  argued  that  the  use  of  such  engineering 
including  hospitals,  shops,  offices,  schools, 
controls 
kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or 
public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls would be an 
additional important measure to reduce the likelihood of transmission (ibid.).

Transmission by asymptomatic people 

The  period  during  which  infected  people  are  contagious  varies  between  different 
diseases. This parameter has a major impact on the epidemiological presentation 
of a disease, and on the type of measures that  are effective. It  is,  however,  not 
known in the beginning of an epidemic caused by a new pathogen. In the case of 
COVID-19, it was initially assumed by many that pre- and a-symptomatic people 
would not transmit the disease, or would do so very rarely. As a consequence, in 
most  European  countries  mitigation  measures  have  focused  on  patients  with 
symptoms.  Contacts  of  patients  were  asked  to  isolate  if  and  when  they  had 
symptoms, and contact tracing was not immediately initiated during the first wave 
of  COVID-19.  It  is  now  known  that  SARS-COV-2  can  be  transmitted  by 
asymptomatic  infected  people,  which  supports  the  case  for  wide  testing  and  for 
the general public to wear face masks (Gandhi et al., 2020).

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

The issue of asymptomatic transmission illustrates the difficulties associated with 
lack  of  knowledge  about  the  characteristics  of  new  pathogens.  The  absence  of 
evidence  on  asymptomatic  transmission  did  not  mean  evidence  of  absence,  and 
strategies  for  management  of  the  epidemic  should  not  have  dismissed  the 
possibility  of  asymptomatic  transmission.  A  similar  reasoning  holds  for  the 
wearing of masks; absence of robust evidence of efficacy does not mean evidence 
of  absence  of  efficacy.  Thus,  careful  decision-making in conditions of uncertainty 
is a crucial part of the management of epidemics. 

Hygiene measures 

Frequent hand hygiene is one of the most important measures for combating the 
spread of SARS-CoV-2. This also means that the availability of sufficient amounts 
of  water,  soap  and  disinfectant  solutions  is  required.41  Safe  drinking  water  is 
crucial  for  avoiding  the  spread  of  many  infectious  diseases  in  general.  Ensuring 
the  availability  of  sanitation  facilities  for  all  is  important.  This  has  been  of 
particular  concern  as  regards  schools  and  workplaces,  and  has  raised  challenges 
particularly in low and middle income countries (Mushi & Shao, 2020). 

The possibility of transmission by fomites, i.e. objects or materials which are likely 
to  carry  infection,  such  as  clothes,  utensils,  and  furniture,  warrants  specific 
hygiene  measures,  such  as  regular  cleaning  and  disinfecting  of  surfaces.  Viable 
SARS-CoV-2  virus  and/or  RNA  detected  by  RT-PCR  can  be  found  on  surfaces  for 
periods  ranging  from  hours  to  days,  depending  on  the  ambient  environment 
(including temperature and humidity) and the type of surface.42 However, despite 
strong  evidence  of  virus  survival  on  surfaces,  there  is  little  or  no  evidence  on 
contamination via surfaces (Mondelli et al., 2020). 

Testing, tracing and isolating strategies 

Results from modelling studies show that Test-Trace-and-Isolate (TTI)  strategies 
are a useful tool to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, in particular when the number 
of new infections is low (Contreras et al.,  2020).  According  to  these  studies,  TTI 
measures  can  reduce  the  effective  reproduction  number  R  (which  signifies  the 
average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus to) by half. 
However, to bring R down to 1 in order to stop exponential growth of the number 
of  infections,  additional  measures,  such  as  social  distancing,  increased  hygiene 
and wearing masks, are  necessary (ibid.). This is because the implementation of 
TTI-strategies  is  impaired  by  imperfect  quarantining  behaviour,  undiscovered 
contacts  and  unnoticed  asymptomatic  cases.  It  is  estimated  that  40–75%  of 
infections may be mild or asymptomatic (Jeyanathan et al., 2020).

Testing  capacities  are  still  limited  and  vary  strongly  between  Member  States 
(ECDC, 2020c) (see Figure 7). The following factors need to be considered prior to 
implementation  of  any  population-wide  testing  strategy:  the  epidemiological 
situation, costs, logistics, technical feasibility, resource availability, contact tracing 
capabilities,  other  barriers  to  testing,  potential  false  positivity  and  timely 
notification of test results (ibid.). 

In view of testing capacities being limited, it has been suggested to use tests in a 
targeted and strategic manner.43 In addition to the limited laboratory capacity for 
testing,  insufficiencies  in  the  logistical  work  flow  have  been  posing  challenges, 
such as the management and communication of test results, as shown by recent 
incidents,  e.g.  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  Bavaria,  where  people  tested  positive 
were missed by contact tracers and not requested to self-isolate due to the use of 
inadequate IT tools or manual handling of data. 

For  TTI  to  work  it  is  paramount  that  persons  who  were  tested  positive  or  who 
were in contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases are isolated as quickly as possible 
(ECDC, 2020c). This is emphasised by the fact that the pre-symptomatic period, 
during which the infected persons show no signs of the disease yet, but can infect 
other people, lasts 2 to 12 days (compared to the incubation period for influenza 
of  1  to  4  days).  Asymptomatic  individuals  may  even  show  a  significantly  longer 
duration of viral shedding, i.e. a longer time during which they transmit the virus 
than  their  symptomatic  counterparts  (Jeyanathan  et  al.,  2020).  Individuals  have 
been shown to be infectious up to 2.5 days before symptom onset and as many as 
50% of infections seem to occur through pre-symptomatic people (Ganyani et al., 
2020; Spellberg et al., 2020). 

Therefore, after the identification of the contact cluster of an infected person, the 
contacts should be isolated as a preventive measure without waiting for the test 
results,  to  avoid  risking  further  infections.  Privacy-friendly  and  secure  contact 
tracing and warning apps should be developed in a way that they are effective.(cid:5)(cid:5) 
They should be interoperable so that they can be used across borders.

It has moreover been suggested that receiving a negative test result after 5 to 7 
days of quarantining should safely allow for ending one’s quarantine.45 In order to 
step  up  testing  capacities,  suitable  additional  university  and  commercial 
laboratories  could  be  identified  and  repurposed  to  complement  the  work  of 
existing testing laboratories.  

The  ECDC  provided  recommendations  for  scaling  up  contact  tracing  by  adapting 
traditional  approaches  to  available  local  resources  and  by  using  a  number  of 
resource-saving measures including the use of well-trained non-public-health staff 
and volunteers, repurposing existing resources such as call centres, reducing the 
intensity  of  contact  follow-up,  and  using  new  technologies  such  as  contact 
management  software  and  mobile  apps  (ECDC,  2020a).  This  is  particularly 
important in view of the approaching Northern Hemisphere winter with a possible 
epidemic  of  influenza  virus,  which  causes  similar  symptoms  as  SARS-CoV-2,  to 
differentiate  between  the  two  pathogens  (Stowe  et  al.,  2020;  Jianguo  Zhang  et 
al., 2020). 

In  summary,  a  combination  of  measures  designed  to  reduce  the  time  during 
which  those  infected  interact  with  others  –  i.e.  intensive  large-scale  and  easily 
accessible  diagnostic  testing  which  provides  rapid  results,  and  intensive  contact 
tracing – has been shown to be particularly effective (Kontis et al., 2020).  

The rapidity of the response, i.e. the early onset of mitigation measures, is crucial 
for its effectiveness (Amer et al., 2020; Loewenthal et al., 2020) (see also Figure 
8).  Advanced  modelling  tools  have  strong  potential  to  help  in  time-critical 
decisions  on  mitigation  measures  (Amer  et  al.,  2020;  Dehning  et  al.,  2020; 
Loewenthal et al., 2020).  

Strict  lockdowns  have  been  necessary  as  an  ’emergency  brake’  across  the  world 
to  reduce  infection  rates  in  the  first  phases  of  the  epidemic.  The  timely  onset  of 
lockdowns  has  been  shown  to  be  an  important  factor  for  containment  (Amer  et 
al., 2020; Dehning et al., 2020; Loewenthal et al., 2020). However, the strictness 
and duration of lockdowns, which also have adverse social and economic effects, 
have been found to be less relevant for effectiveness (Loewenthal et al., 2020).

Immune response 

Infection  with  SARS-CoV-2  induces  protective  immunity  through  antibody  and 
cellular  responses.  There  is  also  some  evidence  for  cross-immunity  induced  by 
other  coronaviruses.  Understanding  adaptive  immunity  to  SARS-CoV-2  is 
important  for  vaccine  development,  interpreting  the  COVID-19  pathogenesis and 
its  spread,  evaluating  the  possibility  of  reaching  herd  immunity  and  the  decision 
on effective pandemic control measures. This includes the need for measuring the 
longevity  of  antibodies  SARS-CoV-2  to  get  insights  into  the  possible  duration  of 
the  naturally  acquired  or  vaccine–induced  protective 
immunity.  Previous 
longitudinal  studies  of  patients  with  SARS-CoV  infections  reported  substantial 
waning of neutralising antibody titres between 1 year and 2 years after infection 
(Cao et al., 2007). Other studies found significant levels of neutralising antibodies 
in recovered SARS patients even 9 to 17 years after initial infection  (Anderson et 
al., 2020). Concerning SARS-CoV-2, available studies show that the concentration 
of  virus  specific  antibodies  declines  rapidly  after  recovery  from  COVID-19  which 
may limit the time period during which the serum from previously infected people 
can  be  applied  for  the  treatment  of  patients  and  the  utility  of  ‘immunity 
passports’.  It  may  also  have  implications  for  the  development  of  an  efficacious 
vaccine  and  cautions  against  the  concept  of  herd  immunity  (Patel  et  al.,  2020). 
On the other hand, memory B cells and T cells may be maintained, even if SARS-
CoV-2 specific antibodies cannot be detected anymore in the serum and may help 
to  provide  a  long  lasting protection  against  the  disease  (Cox  &  Brokstad,  2020). 
Clinical recurrences of COVID-19 symptoms have been reported, and may be due 
to reinfections, a viral relapse or an inflammatory rebound (Gousseff et al., 2020). 
The  immune  response  to  a  vaccine  may  be  different  from  the  response  to  the 
natural virus and it is  not yet known if multiple or multi-annual vaccinations  will 
be needed. 

Cross immunity 

Cross-protective immunity is referring to the protection against one pathogen due 
to  the  pre-existing  adaptive  immunity  developed  from  the  past  exposure  to 
another  pathogen.  A  key  question  is  also  whether  humans  have  pre-existing 
‘immune  memory’  from  infections  with  related  viruses  that  provides  some 
protection against SARS-CoV-2. Among the several coronaviruses causing disease 
in humans, most are associated with mild symptoms, including the ‘common cold’. 
Severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  (SARS-CoV),  Middle  East 
respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  (MERS-CoV)  and  SARS-CoV-2  cause  severe 
respiratory  syndromes.  The  coronaviruses  share  significant  similarity  at  genetic 
and  morphological  level  (Lu  et  al.,  2020)  and  prior  exposure  to  one  virus  could 
confer partial immunity to another. In fact, available data suggests a considerable 
amount  of  cross-reactivity  and  recognition  by  the  hosts’  immune  response

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

Studies  are  ongoing46  to  investigate  whether  antibodies,  which  children  develop 
against the ‘common cold’ coronavirus as part of their immune response, protect 
against a severe form of COVID-19, or on the contrary, whether some antibodies 
in  children  and  adults  worsen  the  disease  symptoms  through  dangerous 
inflammatory reactions – a phenomenon called antibody dependent enhancement 
of  disease.  The  latter  could  hamper  the  development  of  a  safe  vaccine  against 
COVID-19 as was the case for dengue fever (Jeyanathan et al., 2020). 

Herd immunity  

In  their  response  to  SARS-CoV-2,  some  countries  referred  to  the  so-called  herd 
immunity approach. The idea behind this approach is that the disease would stop 
spreading  when  a  sufficient  share  of  the  population  had  become  immune  as  a 
result of infection.47 Until there is an effective COVID-19 vaccine, the only way to 
achieve  this  would  be  to  allow  the  virus  to  infect  a  large  part  of  the  population 
while  protecting  the  most  vulnerable  until  an  infection-acquired  immunity  is 
reached  in  the  low-risk  population.  Against  this,  concerns  have  been  raised  that 
herd  immunity  may  only  be  achieved  at  an  unacceptable  cost  of  lives  and  by 
overburdening health systems.(cid:5)(cid:6) 

Empirical  evidence  from  many  countries  shows  that  it  is  not  feasible  to  ‘shield’ 
vulnerable populations, while allowing a virus to circulate freely amongst the rest 
of  society.(cid:5)(cid:7)  The  proportion  of  vulnerable  people  may  constitute  as  much  as  one 
third  of  some  populations  (including  the  elderly,  people  with  disabilities  or 
underlying  conditions,  as  well  as  marginalised  groups  and  those  in  other 
congregated  settings)  (ibid.).  Many  of  the  aforementioned  groups  depend  upon 
younger,  healthy  carers,  which  makes  a  physical  separation  between  these 
population groups practically impossible. 

It is also important to bear in mind that once the number of new infections is so 
high that health offices cannot efficiently trace the infection chains anymore, i.e. 
when  entering  the  exponential  growth  phase  of  the  pandemic,  it  is  much  more 
difficult to control the spread of the virus.(cid:8)(cid:9)  

The  fact  that  a  significant  percentage  of  people  do  not  show  any  or  only  limited 
disease symptoms (Jeyanathan et al., 2020) may  accelerate the development of

herd immunity. However, according to current estimates it is still not possible to 
achieve  in  the  medium  term  a  state  where  a  sufficient  percentage  of  the 
population  is  protected  against  SARS-CoV-2  due  to  naturally  acquired  immunity. 
According  to  the  head  of emergencies  at the WHO “best estimates” indicate that 
until  today  roughly  10%  of  people  worldwide  may  have  been  infected  by  the 
coronavirus,  which  would  amount  to  20  times  the  number  of  confirmed  cases. 
Thus,  the  natural  development  of  herd  immunity,  if  possible  at  all,  may  take  a 
long  time  and  vaccination  will  probably  be  needed  to  speed  up  the  process  of 
achieving  herd  immunity.  Although  estimates  vary  largely  depending  on  the 
factors,  which  are  considered  in  the  calculations  relating  to  the  heterogeneity  of 
the  population  and  behavioural  differences51  it  is  currently  believed  that  herd 
immunity  to  SARS-CoV-2  would  require  that  60-70%  of  the  population  would 
have to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.  

As mentioned above, the durability of the immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 
after recovery from COVID-19 is not yet understood. Furthermore, asymptomatic 
and  mildly  ill  individuals  seem  to  develop  only  low  levels  of  antibody-mediated 
immunity, which further questions the plausibility of the herd immunity concept in 
the case of SARS-CoV-2 (Jeyanathan et al., 2020).  

Some  infectious  diseases  are  not  completely cleared  and cause long-term  health 
issues.  Examples  are  varicella  zoster  (causing  shingles  at  a  later  stage),  HIV, 
hepatitis  B  virus  (causing  cirrhosis  and  liver  cancer),  Lyme  disease,  herpes 
simplex  virus  (causing  cold  sores),  human  papilloma  virus  (causing  cervical 
cancer).  There  are  indications  that  SARS-CoV-2  can  cause  long-term  health 
problems,  including  in  young,  previously  healthy  people,52  and  the  extent  of 
possible consequences is not fully understood yet.53 

In  addition  to  the  aforementioned  practical  considerations  and  scientific 
uncertainties, the herd immunity approach raises ethical concerns: It is a strictly 
utilitarian calculus (greatest good for the greatest number of people). This is out 
of step with the WHO Ethical Framework which adopts a multi-principled approach 
balancing  utility  and  equity  considerations.  Recognising  the  moral  equality  of  all 
persons,  does  not  allow  for  some  people  to  be  ‘sacrificed’  for  the  interests  of 
others. The lives of vulnerable members of the community must be considered to 
have  an  equal  value  to  those  at  lower  risk.  Moreover,  the  prolonged  isolation  of 
large  parts  of  the  population  is  highly  unethical  as  it  may  further  exacerbate

socio-economic inequities and structural discriminations(cid:8)(cid:5)  and  may  well  be  worse 
for vulnerable groups as they may have fewer social networks, and the burden of 
long periods of isolation for older/sick persons may represent a relatively greater 
loss to them than to younger people. Such an approach also risks stigmatising or 
othering  these  groups.  It  could  negatively  impact  on  solidarity,  which  can  be 
understood  as  mutual  support  among  the  whole  population  and  a  willingness  to 
share the benefits and burdens, with special consideration of the most vulnerable 
(e.g. Prainsack, 2020). Finally, from a human rights perspective, a herd immunity 
approach  would  likely  be  in  breach  of  Article  2  of  the  European  Convention  on 
Human  Rights  (the  right  to  life)  and  potentially  Article  14  which  protects  from 
discrimination. Human rights are inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, 
sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. 

Development of treatments and vaccines  

In  view  of  the  devastating  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  individuals  and 
societies  worldwide,  treatments  and  vaccines  have  to  be  developed  at 
unprecedented  speed  while  the  existing  knowledge  of  the  characteristics  of  the 
virus  and  the  diseases  it causes  are  still  limited  and  evolving  every  day.  Though 
the  aim  is  to  compress  the  time  for  the  development,  manufacturing  and 
distribution  of  treatment  and  vaccines  as  much  as  possible  to  provide  a  relief to 
the present crisis, it is imperative not to compromise on the safety and efficacy of 
any authorised medicinal product or procedure.  

Clinical trials for treatments 

The current literature on the treatment of COVID-19 is full of  ‘anecdotal reports’ 
of  therapeutic  successes  in  clinical  trials  with  a  small  number  of  patients  and 
observational  cohort  studies  claiming  efficacy  with  little  regard  to  the  effect  of 
unrecognized  confounders.  A  huge  number  of  such  statistically  underpowered 
trials were launched simultaneously, and a recent paper reported that only 30 out 
of 1,840 registered trials have actually been reported as peer-reviewed or preprint 
publications.  In  these  uncoordinated  efforts,  very  few  trials  addressed  early 
interventions  aiming  at  preventing  hospitalisation,  but  rather  focussed  on  the 
advanced  disease  states  when  patients  are  already  hospitalised  (Park  et  al., 
2020). 

The  most  meaningful  and  pertinent  trials  for  COVID-19  treatments  were  the  so-
called adaptive trials which combin(cid:5)(cid:9)(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:5)(cid:9)(cid:29)(cid:25)(cid:12)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:31)(cid:25)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:26)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:21)(cid:4)(cid:26)(cid:28)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:21)!(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:23)(cid:26)+(cid:12)(cid:29)(cid:7)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:26)(cid:8)(cid:9)

Thus,  the  RECOVERY  trial  provided  essential  information  for  the  management  of

support  (either  invasive  mechanical  ventilation  by  12.3  age-adjusted  percentage 
points  or  oxygen  alone  by  4.1(cid:2) age-adjusted  percentage  points)  (The  RECOVERY 
Collaborative  Group,  2020).  In  addition,  the  RECOVERY  trial  showed  a  lack  of 
efficacy  for  hydroxychloroquine  and  for  lopinavir–ritonavir.  It  will  continue  to 
evaluate  the  role  of  dexamethasone  in  children,  as  well  as  the  roles  of 
azithromycin,  tocilizumab,  and  convalescent  plasma.  Remdesivir  is  another 
treatment  that  has  been  tested  in  a  large,  adaptive,  randomised,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled  trial.  It  was  demonstrated  to  shorten  the  time to  recovery  by 
about  5  days  in  adults  hospitalised  with  COVID-19  and  evidence  of  lower 
respiratory tract infection (Beigel et al., 2020). Mortality remained high, however, 
despite  the  use  of  Remdesivir,  which  indicates  that  treatment  with  an  antiviral 
drug alone is likely not sufficient for all patients (Beigel et al., 2020). Remdesivir 
was approved by the US  Food and Drug Administration on 23 October 2020 and 
received  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of 
COVID-19  in  adults  and  adolescents  from  12  years  of  age  with  pneumonia  who 
require  supplemental  oxygen(cid:10)(cid:2) Contrasting  to  the  findings  of  Beigel  et  al.,  most 
recent  interim  results  from  the  Solidarity  Therapeutics  Trial,  a  study  with  more 
than  30  participating  countries  coordinated  by  the  World  Health  Organization, 
indicate that like hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens, 
Remdesivir appears to have little or no effect on the duration of the hospital stay 
or  the  28-day  mortality  among  hospitalised  patients.  The  European  Medicines 
Agency (EMA) announced to review the WHO data once available.

Vaccine development 

Vaccine  development  is  a  lengthy,  expensive  process,  which  usually  takes  10  to 
15  years.  In  view  of  the  urgent  need  for  a  vaccine  against  SARS-CoV-2,  the 
attempt is now to compress the development timeline to 1 to 2 years. Because of 
the  major  risks  related  to  the  high  failure  rates  of  potential  vaccine  candidates 
and  the  associated  costs,  developers  typically  follow  a  linear  sequence  of  steps, 
with multiple pauses for data analysis or manufacturing process checks (Lurie et 
al., 2020). To reduce the time from research and development to the deployment 
to  the  necessary  extent,  an  integrated  approach  is  needed to  address  the  whole 
value  chain  and  to  parallelise  many  steps  without  waiting  for  the  successful 
outcome  of  the  preceding  steps.  Recognising  that  this  approach  comes  with 
increased financial risks for the developers, the European Commission adopted a 
vaccine  strategy  in  June  2020,  which  aims  at  accelerating  the  development  of 
COVID-19 vaccines while  ensuring their  quality, safety and efficacy  and securing 
timely access for Member States and worldwide.55 

Once vaccines are proven to be safe and efficacious, billions of doses will have to 
be produced, filled and distributed globally. This requires enormous manufacturing 
capacities,  which  are  not  available  yet.  Building  manufacturing  capacity  can  cost 
hundreds of millions of euros. Furthermore, for novel platform technologies, most 
of which  have not been used for vaccine development so far, such as the mRNA(cid:2)
technology,  large-scale  manufacturing  has  never  been  done.  Thus,  facilities 
capable of producing large quantities must be identified, technologies transferred, 
and  manufacturing  processes  adapted,  all  without  knowing  which  vaccine 
candidate  will  be  viable  (Lurie  et  al.,  2020).  To  ensure  end-to  end  development 
and large-scale manufacturing and deployment, as  well as fair allocation, and to 
protect  private-sector  partners  from  significant  financial  losses,  it  has  been 
proposed to establish a global financing system for future pandemic preparedness 
(ibid). 

Beyond the assessment of vaccine efficacy and safety in clinical trial phase III for 
authorisation,  complementary  questions  have  to  be  addressed  to  inform  public 
health  policies  regarding  safe  and  effective  vaccination  strategies  and 
complementary  measures.  For  instance,  the  efficacy  and  safety  in  different 
population  groups  such  as  children  and  pregnant  women  has  to  be  investigated, 
including also high risk groups such as old persons (> 70 years) and people with 
pre-conditions. Particular attention will have to be paid to the possible occurrence 
of  antibody  dependent  enhancement  of  disease.  In  this  regard,  the  significant 
presence  of  cross-reactive  immunity  in  some  individuals  calls  for  the  possible 
stratification  of  clinical  trial  participants  according  to  their  status  of  pre-existing 
coronavirus  immunity  (Jeyanathan  et  al.,  2020).  As  with  naturally  acquired

infection,  the  potential  duration  and  degree  of  vaccine-induced  immunity  is 
unknown;  similarly,  it  is  uncertain  whether  single-dose  vaccines  will  confer 
immunity  (Jeyanathan  et  al.,  2020).  The  answer  to  these  questions  will  help  to 
decide, which vaccine is most suitable for which target group, how to prioritise the 
population  groups  for  vaccination  and  whether  a  combination  of  two  different 
vaccines  is  more  effective  than  one.  Industry  is  unlikely  to  address  all  these 
questions and to include all the respective target groups in the clinical trials. 

Phase  IV  studies  are  conducted  after  market  authorisation,  when  the  vaccine  is 
widely  administered  in  the  population,  to  ensure  longer  term  monitoring  of 
vaccine  effectiveness  and  safety.  Considering  the  number  of  COVID-19  vaccine 
candidates advancing in development, it is likely that several vaccines will be put 
on the market in a relatively short time span. The post-marketing monitoring will 
require  significant  sample  sizes  (in  the  100.000s)  as  well  as  different 
complementary  study  designs.  Importantly,  the  first  wave  of  candidate  vaccines 
that  are  available  may  not  necessarily  be  the  most  efficacious  ones,  and 
comparative  trials  will  be  needed.  Close  EU-wide  coordination  between  public 
health and regulatory authorities, as well as with industry is essential. Experience, 
e.g. from the occurrence of narcolepsy following influenza vaccination in the 2009 
pandemic, has illustrated the importance of solid phase IV studies to identify rare 
and  unexpected  adverse  events  occurring  sometimes  years  after  the  vaccine 
authorisation  (Johansen  et  al.,  2016).  In  the  context  of  accelerated  vaccine 
development, particular caution is required, and monitoring should be carried out 
for  a  sufficiently  long  time.  Schemes  for  compensation  as  a  result  of  vaccine 
damages  can  support  take-up  of  vaccines,  and  are  fair  both  in  terms  of  justice 
and  reciprocity.  In  times  of  vaccine  hesitancy,  it  will  be  crucial  to  reach  a  broad 
consensus  on  the  monitoring  results  and  the  ensuing  guidance,  based  on  robust 
evidence and communicated in a transparent way, in order to increase public trust 
and confidence.  

For COVID-19 and beyond, a network of vaccine trials at European level may help 
to  ensure  the  generation  of  robust  data  to  inform  public  health  policy,  the 
inclusion  of  a  sufficiently  high  number  of  volunteers  from  different  population 
groups, the readiness of trial sites and may contribute to avoiding fragmentation. 
Such a coordinated approach would also improve the coherence and comparability 
of the collected data.  

In  preparation  of  any  mass  vaccination  campaign  it  is  of  crucial  importance  to 
start communication strategies already during the development and production of 
vaccines to increase the likelihood of their acceptance by the public (see chapter 
The public response: trust, communication, mis- and dis-information). In this, the 
vaccine  supply  system,  specificities  of  national  immunisation  programmes, 
networks  of  primary  health  providers,  and  other  issues  concerning  the 
implementation of a vaccination campaign need to be considered for each country 
and guidance at EU level is important.  In general, the effectiveness of mitigation 
measures  is  crucially  influenced  by  the  public  response,  including  trust  in  and 
compliance with the measures.

The public response: trust, communication, mis- and dis-
information  

Evidence  (Bavel  et  al.,  2020;  Biddlestone  et  al.,  2020;  Bruinen  de  Bruin  et  al., 
2020; Kuiper et al., 2020; L. J. Wolf et al., 2020) suggests that public response to 
onerous risk mitigation measures (such as physical distancing, mask wearing and 
lockdowns) is influenced by a number of cultural factors – such as the prevalence 
of  values  privileging  individual  freedom  or  those  privileging  moral  responsibility 
for  community  welfare  and  self-discipline  and  the  degree  of  social  stigma 
associated with non-compliance or compliance (Tomczyk et al., 2020). Moreover, 
findings  suggesting  that  the  public  response  also  has 
there  are  early 
sociodemographic  correlates  (across  cultures),  such  as  age  and  gender  (Brouard 
et  al.,  2020;  Tomczyk  et  al.,  2020),  and  psychological  ones  such  as  personality 
types  (Brouard  et  al.,  2020),  personal  belief  systems,  personal  ideologies,  and 
affinity with opinion-based groups (Brouard et al., 2020; Maher et al., 2020; Plohl 
&  Musil,  2020).  Science  advice  on  risk  mitigation  measures  may  vary  across 
countries,  as  seen  for  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  It  may  be  tailored  to  specific 
circumstances  such  as  local  cultural  factors,  which  may  also  influence  different 
public responses (Bavel et al., 2020; Biddlestone et al., 2020; Bruinen de Bruin et 
al., 2020; Kuiper et al., 2020; L. J. Wolf et al., 2020).  

Nevertheless,  the  degree  of  public  compliance  looks  to  be  affected  across  the 
board by trust (in public authorities, in the message and in the messengers) as an 
overarching factor (Bavel et al., 2020; Devine et al., 2020; Plohl & Musil, 2020). 
The  idea  that  greater  trust  in  government  leads  to  more  compliance  with  health 
measures is consistent with the experience and study of past pandemics such as 
the  Ebola  outbreak,  SARS,  avian  influenza  and  H1N1  (reviewed  in  Devine  et al., 
2020), and studies specific to COVID-19 further suggest that institutional trust is 
also  associated  with  lower  mortality  levels  (ibid.).  Therefore,  “understanding  the 
dynamics of trust, how it facilitates and hinders policy responses” is fundamental 
to  effective  policy  response  to  future  health  crises  (ibid.).56  The  experience  and 
study of the COVID-19 pandemic has offered a number of relevant lessons for the 
future.  

The pandemic has given rise to an infodemic, defined as “an excessive amount of 
information about a problem, which makes it difficult to identify a solution, [and 
which]  can  spread  misinformation,  disinformation  and  rumours  during  a  health 

56 The literature review on public trust and the response to pandemics (Devine et al. 2020) 

highlights the complexity of the trust dynamics: trust is generally seen as a ‘good thing’; 
however, excessive trust by the government in the citizens’ sense of responsibility may 
hinder effective response, e.g. by slowing down the introduction of restrictive containment 
measures, whereas excessive trust by the governed may lead them to believe that the 
public authorities are handling the pandemic competently (and hence, e.g. be slower to 
take personal precautions beyond what is required by law) while they may not be. 
Conversely, a certain amount of scepticism on the part of the governed is a part of 
democratic accountancy and improves governance, whereas excessive distrust opens the 
governed to the influence of conspiracy beliefs.

emergency, (…) hamper an effective public health response, and create confusion 
and  distrust”  (WHO  2020).  Infodemics  thrive  particularly  through  social  media, 
due to the fact that they have largely removed the traditional roles of information 
gatekeepers  (e.g.  media  editors  who  could  potentially  act  as  fact-checkers; 
(Lewandowsky  &  Cook,  2020).  Disinformation57  is  a  particularly  egregious 
phenomenon  as  its  aims  include  not  only  to  influence  public  opinion,  but  more 
broadly  to  “polarise  views  by  infiltrating  online  communities  and  amplifying 
divisive  narratives”  as  well  as  “to  sow  confusion  and  erode  the  value  placed  on 
facts” (Mair et al., 2019). 

Action  is  already  being  taken  by  international  organisations,  notably  the  WHO58 
and the EU, to tackle misinformation and disinformation. The WHO is developing a 
Network  for  Information  in  Epidemics  (EPI-WIN)  based  on  the  concept  of  ‘trust 
chains’,59  and  has  set  up  a  ‘myth-busting’  site  (see  Figure  9).60  The  EU,  notably 
through  the  Joint  Communication  from  June  2020,61  has  outlined  a  range  of 
countermeasures,  which  include  promoting  authoritative  content  and  fact-
checking activities, e.g. through cooperation with social media platforms around a 
voluntary  code  of  practice,  while  also  aiming  to  safeguard  the  freedom  and 
expression and pluralistic democratic debate.

57 Following the EU 2020 Joint Statement (see below), ‘disinformation’ is defined as spreading 
false information ‘with an intention to deceive or cause public harm’ (e.g. by a hostile 
foreign power, or for internal political gain), while ‘misinformation’ refers to such actions 
when they may have been done in good faith.

The  EU  Joint  Communication  states  that  ‘misinformation  can  be  addressed 
through  well-targeted  rebuttals  and  myth  busting  and  media  literacy  initiatives’. 
While  the  ready  availability  of  clear  and  authoritative  core  information,  is  an 
essential  prerequisite,  it  is  not  sufficient:  contrary  to  what  the  title  of  the 
Communication seems to suggest, ‘getting the facts right’ is not enough to change 
minds.  Refuting(cid:2) misinformation  (‘debunking’)  involves  dealing  with  complex 
cognitive  processes  (Cook  &  Lewandowsky,  2011;  Lewandowsky  &  Cook,  2020) 
and  emotional  responses  to  information  (Mair  et  al.,  2019).  Human  reasoning 
universally  uses  strategies  such  as  confirmation  bias  and  motivated  reasoning 
(whereby  people  selectively  look  for  information  confirming  their  pre-established 
views) as well as disconfirmation bias (whereby, conversely, they tend to dismiss 
information that contradicts their prior beliefs). An epidemic outbreak is clearly an 
emotionally charged event (see Oikkonen, 2017).  

Emotional  response  to  information  is  influenced  by  political  group  identities  and 
deeply  ingrained  worldviews,  particularly  for  polarising  subjects  (Maher  et  al., 
2020; Oikkonen, 2017), which also indirectly affect the general degree of trust in 
science and experts (Plohl & Musil, 2020). An extreme case is that of conspiracy 
beliefs,  whose  adherents  combine  particular  cognitive  perseverance  in  upholding 
beliefs in the absence of evidence with very severe distrust of official information 
and traditional messengers (Freeman et al., 2020; Lewandowsky & Cook, 2020). 
Conspiracy  beliefs  are  thus  not  linked  only  to  cognitive  traits.  They  may  be  an 
extreme manifestation of a sense of ‘not being heard’, shared by larger sections of 
the population. Such beliefs are found to be linked with a sense of powerlessness, 
anger,  perceived  vulnerability  (ibid.)  and  individualism  (Biddlestone  et  al.,  2020; 
Bristielle,  2020).  Despite  their  small  numbers,  conspiracy  theorists  are  found  to

have a disproportionate influence due to their typical high levels of activism; their 
ideas influence a “substantial minority of the population” (ibid.).  

Early  scientific  evidence  shows  that  holding  conspiracy  beliefs  about  the  COVID-
1962  pandemic  (e.g.  Bristielle,  2020;  Freeman  et  al.,  2020)  is  associated  with 
endorsement  of  other  conspiracy  theories,  notably  those  on  climate-change  and 
vaccine conspiracy beliefs. COVID-19  conspiracy theories have  typically  provided 
the  rationale  for  anti-mask  movements  and  similar  acts  of  civil  disobedience 
(ibid.). 

Evidence offers a number of elementary principles to help tackle the issue of dis- 
and  misinformation,  including  conspiracy  beliefs.  These  include:  (a)  starting  and 
ending the core facts to be communicated (rather than the myth to be debunked) 
and  ensuring  their  clarity,  pithiness,  concreteness,  and  plausibility  within  the 
narrative (b) ensuring explicit warnings  – before mentioning the myth  – that the 
upcoming  information  is  false,  (c)  explaining  the  fallacy  and  (d)  providing  an 
entire coherent narrative based on the core facts, which is to fill the cognitive gap 
left  by  the  misinformation  that  is  being  refuted  (Cook  &  Lewandowsky,  2011). 
Earlier research (in 2010s) has raised concerns that refuting misinformation may 
inadvertently  reinforce  it,  and  that  frequent  refutation  may  also  increase 
familiarity  with  (and  thus  belief  in)  the  myth  to  be  debunked,  (the  ‘backfire 
effect’). However, recent evidence shows that the backfire effect is actually rarer 
and poses fewer risks than once though (Lewandowsky and Cook 2020b; Mair et 
al.,  2019).  Consequently,  repeating  misinformation  while  refuting  it  has  been 
found  to  be  largely  safe  (as  long  as  the  above  message  design  principles  are 
respected), and can even increase the saliency and effectiveness of the refutation 
(Lewandowsky and Cook 2020b).  

There  is  substantial  evidence  (Lewandowsky  &  Cook,  2020;  Mair  et  al.,  2019) 
supporting the effectiveness of prebunking (or inoculation) – whereby publics are 
pre-emptively  made  aware  that  they  may  be  misled  in  future,  or  are  exposed  to 
hypothetical,  weak  false  claims  which  are  debunked  (ibid.):  for  example, 
prebunking  has  been  shown  to  be  more  effective  than  classic  debunking  in 
refuting  anti-vaccination  conspiracy 
(Jolley  &  Douglas,  2017; 
Lewandowsky  &  Cook,  2020).  (Lewandowsky  &  Cook,  2020;  Mair  et  al.,  2019)63

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

The  above  findings  are  of  direct  relevance  for  pandemic  preparedness  and 
response, whereby vaccine acceptance and take-up are already predicted to pose 
a  challenge  even  before  vaccines  are  developed,  due  to  a  proliferation  of  anti-
vaccination  conspiracy  beliefs  which  have  led  to  a  rise  in  general  vaccine 
hesitancy in European populations (French et al., 2020). Next to active resistance 
from  the  anti-vaccination  movement,  vaccination  campaigns  for  COVID-19  and 
future  pandemics  are  expected  to  run  against  ‘passive  competition’  from 
inaccurate  media  coverage,  negative  social  norms  (e.g.  distrust  in  experts;  a 
sense of ‘not being heard’) as well as economic and structural factors such as cost 
and access (French et al., 2020).  

WHO  already  advocates  a  pre-emptive  pro-vaccination  strategy  for  epidemics 
(WHO,  2014).  There  are  existing  detailed  guidelines  for  implementing  such 
strategies,  drawing  mainly  on  insights  from  behavioural  sciences  and  social 
marketing,64 e.g. generic ones put forward by ECDC (2014) and those developed 
specifically  for  the  anticipated  COVID-19  vaccination  campaign  (French  et  al. 
2020). The latter combines the following core components: (1) mobilising a ‘pro-
vaccination’ coalition of  the public, private and  NGO sectors; (2) evidence-based 
social  marketing  campaigns  to  promote  vaccine  demand;  (3)  community 
engagement and trust building programmes; (4) a vaccine accessibility strategy; 
(5) a co-ordinated communication strategy offering  a  compelling  narrative  which 
avoids potential backfire effects (ibid.). 

The above approach is designed for large sections of the public, including notably 
‘the  vaccine  hesitant’.  Evidence  suggests  that  engaging  with  conspiracy  theorists 
and  active  resisters  further  requires  reliance  on  trusted  messengers  (ideally  the 
‘exiters’, i.e. former conspiracy theorists), appeal to critical thinking, empathy and 
avoiding  ridicule  (Lewandowsky  &  Cook,  2020).  Available  evidence  underscores 
the  key  importance  of  community  engagement,  which  includes  mechanisms  for 
listening to public concerns and understanding their values (ECDC & ASEF, 2016; 
Nuzzo et al., 2019). 

Another  core  factor  affecting  the  public  response  to  health  risk  mitigation 
measures  –  which  the  joint  advisors  have  already  addressed  in  some  detail 
earlier65 – is trust in the science underlying these measures, and the transparency

direct the public towards socially desirable goals.

of the public authorities about how,  and to what extent, they  have ‘followed the 
science’  (see  also  Newton,  2020).  As  science  advice  may  vary  across  countries, 
accounting  for  that  divergence  in  a  clear,  transparent  manner,  is  also  a  part  of 
sustaining trust in the science. 

Finally,  available  evidence  –  particularly  for  the  COVID-19  pandemic  –  offers 
insights  on  the  core  factors  which  influence  public  trust  in  the  government,  and 
thus  the  degree  of  public  compliance  with  onerous  mitigation  measures.  More 
individualist  cultures  could  benefit  from  public  appeals  to  adopt  more  collectivist 
attitudes  at  times  of  health  emergencies,  including  future  crises  (Biddlestone  et 
al.,  2020)  –  however,  the  influence  of  that  cultural  tendency  must  not  be 
oversimplified as more factors are at  play.  A  narrative built  around  the message 
of ‘we are all in this together’ has the potential to be a fruitful endeavour (ibid.). 
However,  next  to  transparency  and  clarity,  a  critical  requirement  is  for  public 
officials  to  set  an  example  and  lead  by  example.  Failure  to  do  so  has  been 
demonstrated  to  have  devastating  effects  on  the  level  of  public  trust  and  hence 
public compliance (see Fancourt et al., 2020; Newton, 2020, for a UK example).

6.  KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES 

Decision-making  during  a  health  crisis  is  best  informed  by  having  a  strong 
evidence-base  (ECDC,  2018b).  At  the  same  time,  anticipation  of  the  types  of 
decisions  needed  and  what  new  information  is  most  important  for  developing 
policy can help prioritise research.  

Research and innovation play an important role during, after, and  in  anticipation 
of  public  health  emergencies  (WHO,  2016)  and  are  essential  for  preparedness. 
The knowledge that is generated through research in anticipation of, in the midst 
of,  and  after  a  health  emergency  is  critical  to  build  future  capacity  to  better 
achieve  the  goals  of  preparedness  and  response:  preventing  injury,  illness, 
disability, and death and supporting recovery (Lurie et al., 2013). 

Progress was observed in the past research related to virology, epidemiology, and 
infectious diseases among others. However, in research linked to public health, its 
governance,  technology,  and  risk  communication  there  seem  to  be  gap  areas 
(Zhang & Shaw, 2020). Identifying trends and gaps in the initial response of the 
research community to the COVID-19 pandemic may provide a valuable guidance 
in  the  prioritisation  of  actions  to  researchers,  clinicians,  and  policymakers  in  the 
preparedness and response to future large-scale public health crises (Budd et al., 
2020). 

The rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unknowns coming 
with  a  new  virus  underlined  the  need  for  research  and  innovation  to  close 
knowledge gaps and to provide sustainable solutions. At the same time, for every 
insight into COVID-19, more questions emerge and others linger (Callaway et al., 
2020). 

Since the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016, the WHO has established the 
R&D  Blueprint  strategy.  The  WHO  R&D  Blueprint66  is  a  global  strategy  and 
preparedness plan that aims at the rapid activation of research and development 
activities  during  epidemics.  Its  goal  is  to  fast-track  the  availability  of  effective 
tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives. In this most recent 
outbreak  this  has  allowed  the  WHO  to  work  closely  with  global  experts, 
governments  and  partners  to  rapidly  expand  scientific  knowledge  on  the  virus. 
Experts recognised that an important amount of information is available but there 
are  still  concerns  about  knowledge  gaps  and  lack  of  clear  evidence  to  support 
some interventions. For example, what is the quality of life among survivors after 
severe  disease,  what  are  effective  public  health  measures  at  the  national  and 
international  levels  that  can  retard  the transmission  while minimising the impact 
on global citizens and the global economy?

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

The  WHO  global  research  roadmap  (WHO,  2020)  has  identified  social  science-
related research as a priority area, more focus will be needed in multi-, cross- and 
trans-disciplinary  research  related  to  public  health  and  disaster  risk  reduction. 
Studies  on  societal  dimensions  may  cover  social,  cultural  and  economic  habits 
increasing  the  risk  of  outbreaks,  socio-economic  and  psychosocial  consequences 
of  pandemics  and  of  mitigation  measures,  and  broader  questions  of  epidemic-
resilient societal structures. This will involve fields of study as manifold as health 
inequality, poverty, employment, gender, ageing, housing, urbanism and rurality, 
mobility, environmental sustainability and law and governance. 

In 2016, the EU Scientific Panel for Health (Sipido et al., 2016) called for research 
policies  to  facilitate  high-quality,  cross-border  collaboration  within  Europe  and 
beyond;  ensure  a  harmonised,  simplified,  and  transparent  regulatory  framework 
that  supports  innovation;  multidisciplinary  research  across  the  innovation  cycle, 
and  to  create  an  European  Council  for  Health  to  support  biomedical  and  clinical 
research in Europe. 

Coordination of efforts is needed and should be expanded at European level. Ad-
hoc  measures  and  plans  are  important,  but  these  will  not  prepare  Europe  for 
future  public  health  crises.  An  agency  for  biomedical  research  and  development 
would support the EU’s capacity and readiness to respond to cross-border threats 
and  emergencies,  and  address  supply  chain  dependencies,  notably 
for 
pharmaceutical  products.  This  Agency  may  address  fragmentation  and  may  help 
in underpinning coordination and synergy, between  Member States’ activities, as 
well as act as a single point of entry for all health research. 

Furthermore, to be better prepared for future pandemics, including ‘Disease X’ — 
a  newly  emerging  epidemic  disease,  and  following  the  experience  with  influenza 
vaccines, it has been recommended (Nuzzo et al., 2019) that novel development 
and  manufacturing  platforms  be  established  that  can  be  readily  adapted  to  the 
respective  pathogens.  These  should  ideally  make  use  of  diverse  technologies  to 
increase the likelihood of obtaining one successful and suitable vaccine candidate. 
For instance, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has led 
an  initiative  to  support  early  development  of  platforms  and  test  them  against 
‘prototype pathogens’ from various viral families (Lurie et al., 2020). 

Marston, Paules & Fauci (2017) describe three research approaches, in particular, 
that  can  be  used  to  improve  vaccine  development  for  emerging  infectious 
diseases.  The  first  of  these  approaches  prepares  vaccine  candidates  for  specific 
pathogens that have been prioritised by the WHO on the basis of their “lethality 
and severity of disease, transmissibility, animal hosts and vectors, and dearth of 
existing countermeasures.” Although the aforementioned criteria allow to prepare 
vaccines  for  the  most  critical  emerging  infectious  diseases,  it  is  impossible  to 
exactly predict every pathogen that will develop into a pandemic in the future (as 
was the case for HIV, SARS and Zika; see Marston, Paules, & Fauci, 2017).  

For  this  reason,  the  second  research  approach  rests  on  expanding  vaccine 
platforms  independently  of  specific  pathogens.  These  platforms  use  different

strategies  and  technologies  to  build  vaccine  candidates  that  can  be  applied  and 
adapted  to  various  pathogens.  Currently  novel  platforms  are  being  developed, 
such  as  viral  vectors  and  nucleic  acids,  which  might  significantly  decrease  the 
time needed to create new vaccines. Lurie et al. (2020) suggest that these novel 
vaccine  platforms  could  take  the  steps  from  viral  sequencing  to  clinical  trials  in 
only  16  weeks.  The  Coalition  for  Epidemic  Preparedness  Innovation  develops 
reserves of investigational vaccines for each pathogen after completing phase 2a 
trials,  so  that  they  are  ready  to  enter  into  clinical  trials  at  the  onset  of  future 
outbreaks (Lurie et al., 2020). 

During  health  emergencies,  manufacturing  capacities  could  be  developed  in 
parallel  to  the  creation  of  vaccine  candidates.  However,  this  would  imply  that 
large  investments  need  to  be  made  before  sufficient  data  on  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of  the  vaccine  candidate  are  available,  therefore  posing  a  significant 
financial risk (ibid.).  

The  third  research  approach  is  not  concerned  with  the  development  of  vaccine 
platforms,  but  with  the  application  of  these  platforms  to  prepare  vaccine 
candidates  for  ‘prototype  pathogens’  (Marston  et  al.,  2017).  As  viruses  are 
categorised  into  families  based  on  their  functional  and  structural  properties, 
vaccine candidates for one pathogen may also work for similar microorganisms of 
the same family.  

It  should  be  noted  that  none  of  these  research  approaches  by  themselves  are 
considered  to  be  sufficient  for  preparedness  in  vaccine  development.  Instead, 
they should be seen as complementary, implying that all three approaches should 
be pursued (Marston et al., 2017; Lurie et al. 2020).  

In  order  to  inform  the  public  health  response  to  a  pandemic  and  to  provide  for 
appropriate scientific evaluation of any new intervention or medicine, research will 
be  required.  Data  from  such  research  plays  a  crucial  role  in  mitigating  mortality 
and  morbidity  during  a  pandemic.  It  must  be  acknowledged  however,  that 
significant pressures can be brought to bear in terms of planning, executing and 
reporting  research  during  a  public  health  emergency,  which  raises  issues  of 
research  quality  and  integrity.  London  et  al.  (2020)  warn  against  ‘pandemic 
research  exceptionalism’  in  which  methodological  standards  of  high-quality 
research  are  lowered,  as  this  may  heighten  structural  and  individual  biases  in 
scientific research that can endanger the safety and well-being of patients.  

A  particular  feature  of  the  current  pandemic  has  been  the  significant  number  of 
publications  on  COVID-19  being  released  on  pre-print  servers.  While  pre-prints 
offer the benefit of rapid access to new scientific data, this comes at the expense 
of  a  thorough  peer-review  of  the  research  (Bramstedt,  2020;  Dinis-Oliveira, 
2020), as was illustrated by clinical data published regarding the effectiveness of 
hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. Both, rigorous research criteria and the 
peer-review  process,  are  essential  components  for  the  quality  of  scientific 
research, ensuring that false leads can be avoided and resources will be allocated 
to the most promising interventions.

Joint Opinion 
Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

Several studies suggest that research quality could be better protected by making 
sure that data and methods are shared appropriately  (Boetto et al., 2020; Davis 
et  al.,  2020;  London  &  Kimmelman,  2020).  This  has  been  one  of  the  key 
weaknesses  in  the  research  response  to  the  current  pandemic.  To  provide  an 
example,  of  the  31  large  clinical  trials  on  COVID-19  interventions  surveyed  by 
Davis et al. (2020), only three made their protocols publicly available. While this 
makes peer-review more difficult, it also entails the risks of creating competition 
between  trials  and  duplicating  research  efforts.  Coordination  of  clinical  trials  is 
necessary to ensure that scarce resources do not go to waste. Moreover, journals 
may  improve  research  transparency  by  requiring  researchers  to  publish  their 
original data while asking them to pre-specify research protocols.

7.  POLICY/INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT AND 

BACKGROUND 

The EU responses to the COVID-19 crisis and policy 
initiatives on better preparedness for health crises  

(cid:2)

It  is  recognised  that,  in  response  to  the  acute  crisis  caused  by  the  COVID-19 
pandemic,  the  EU  and  its  Member  States  have  introduced  measures  to  mitigate 
impact  on  health  as  well  as  social  and  economic  impacts,  such  as  protecting 
employment  and  supporting  medical  care  services  for  vulnerable  groups, 
maintaining  the  functioning  of  the  European  single  market,  and  supporting  the 
transport  and  tourism  sector.  Public  health  measures  were  taken  to  stabilise  the 
situation and bring the number of new infections to a level better manageable by 
health  systems.  To  place  this  joint  advice  in  the  context  of  the  policy  initiatives 
taken  in  the  EU,  we  summarise  below  the  main  elements  of  the  EU  response 
without claiming completeness. 

In  January  the  Early  Warning  and  Response  System  (EWRS)  of  the  EU  was 
triggered,  and  monitoring  of  COVID-19  cases  in  Europe  began.  The  EU  Health 
Security  Committee  (HSC)  had  held  dedicated  meetings  on  COVID-19  since 
January  2020.  This  Committee  is  chaired  by  the  European  Commission  and 
comprises  representatives  of  national  ministries  for  health.  After  the  H1N1 
influenza  outbreak,  the  Commission  gave  it  the  responsibility  of  coordinating 
responses to cross-border threats to health in Europe. However, as the mandate 
of the HSC is mainly limited to information exchange and coordination, it does not 
have  the  power  to  enforce  common  measures  and  recommendations  for  the 
response to the COVID-19 outbreak.67 

The European Commission’s Advisory Panel on COVID-1968 was established on 16 
March to advise the Commission on the formulation of response measures in line 
with  the  different  stages  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  It  is  tasked  with  the 
identification and mitigation of significant gaps, inconsistencies or inadequacies in 
measures  taken  to  contain  and  manage  the  spread  of  COVID-19  including  in 
clinical  management  and  treatment  as  well  as  with  the  prioritisation  of  health 
care,  civil  protection  and  other  resources  as  well  as  support  measures  to  be 
organised  or  coordinated  at  EU 
it  comprises  the 
recommendation  of  policy  measures  for  addressing  and  mitigating  medium  and 
long-term consequences of COVID-19.

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

Based on existing legislation and structures, such as the Cross Border Healthcare 
Directive,69  early  measures  taken  by  the  European  Commission  were  aimed  at 
overcoming  the  challenges  in  the  availability  and  sharing  of  and  the  access  to 
personal protective equipment, medicines and medical devices. This included the 
use of joint procurement procedures and common strategic stockpiles of medical 
equipment,  including  intensive  medical  care  equipment,  personal  protective 
equipment, vaccines and therapeutics, and laboratory supplies under the EU Civil 
Protection  Mechanism.  It  also  involved  increased  controls  of  market  surveillance 
and safety authorities to ensure that only safe protective equipment is offered on 
the EU single market. 

In  April  2020  the  EU  ERAvsCorona  action  plan70  laid  out  the  ten  first  priority 
innovation.  It  aims  at 
short-term  coordinated  actions 
coordination,  cooperation,  data  sharing  and

trials, establishment of a one-stop shop for Coronavirus Research and Innovation

Hackathon to mobilise European innovators and civil society. 

in  research  and 

funding  between 

joint 

For  supporting  research  and  innovation  against  COVID-19  the  European 
Commission  also  used  pre-established  tools  and  structures,  as  well  as  existing 
networks  and  partnerships,  based  on  the  experience  of  previous  pandemics, like 
the  2014–2016  Western  African  Ebola  outbreak.  Altogether  the  European 
Commission  mobilised  EUR  1  billion  under  Horizon  2020  for  funding  COVID-19 
related  research  and  innovation.  The  forthcoming  Horizon  Europe  programme  is 
expected  to  continue  funding  research  and  innovation  to  address  COVID-19  and 
epidemics and pandemics more generally. 

As part of the 27 May Communication ‘Europe's moment: Repair and Prepare for 
the  Next  Generation’,71  the  European  Commission  created  a  new  standalone 
EU4Health  programme,  for  supporting  prevention,  crisis  preparedness,  the 
procurement  of  vital  medicines  and  equipment,  as  well  as  improving  long-term 
health outcomes. It is intended to “deliver a long-term vision for well-performing 
and  more  resilient  public  health  systems,  notably  by  investing  in  disease 
prevention  and  surveillance,  and  improving  access  to  healthcare,  diagnosis  and 
treatment.”  

The same Communication proposes putting in place a stronger crisis preparedness 
and management for future scenarios, e.g. by strengthening  rescEU, an  element 
of  the  EU  Civil  Protection  Mechanism  to  protect  citizens  from  disasters  and  to 
manage  all  types  of  emerging  risks.  The  intention  is  to  ‘strengthen  the  rescEU’s

emergency  support  teams”  and  “create  an  EU-level  reserve  of  essential  supplies 
and equipment to be mobilised in response to major emergencies.” 

The  European  Commission  also  put  in  place  the  Clearing  House  for  medical 
equipment  used  for  COVID-1972  (CCH)  as  a  platform  for  the  assessment  of  and 
exchange  with  Member  States  on  demand  and  supply  of  key  COVID-19  medical 
countermeasures,  as  well  as  monitoring  and  helping  to  improve  EU  industry 
capacity in this field. 

The EU Strategy for COVID-19 vaccines,73 adopted on 17 June, aims at “ensuring 
the  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  COVID-19  vaccines;  securing  timely  access  to 
vaccines for Member States and their population while leading the global solidarity 
effort; and at ensuring equitable and affordable access for all in the EU as early as 
possible.”  It  builds  on  two  pillars  by  securing  the  production  of  a  sufficient 
quantity  of  vaccines  in  the  EU  through  Advance  Purchase  Agreements  with 
vaccine  producers  via  the  Emergency  Support  Instrument  and  by  adapting  EU 
rules  in  order  to  accelerate  the  development,  authorisation  and  availability  of 
vaccines while maintaining the standards for vaccine quality, safety and efficacy. 

The 15 July Communication on short-term EU health preparedness for COVID-19 
outbreaks74 outlines key measures to be taken in the short-term in preparation for 
further COVID-19 outbreaks in Europe. Particular attention is paid to reducing the 
burden of the 2020/2021 seasonal flu.  

The  Communication  underlines  the  importance  of  rapid  scalability  of  testing, 
contact  tracing  and  public  health  surveillance  to  control  the  possible  progression 
of the pandemic and to avoid having to reinstate strict confinement measures. It 
also  states  that  the  systematic  identification  of  vulnerable  locations  and 
populations  in  all  Member  States  is  key  to  tailoring  activities  specifically  to 
vulnerable  groups  and  to  high  density  settings  with  limited  ability  for  people  to 
physically distance. 

The Communication invites Member States to urgently establish a clear overview 
on  their  needs  for  medical  supplies,  their  national  production  capacities  and 
stockpiles of essential equipment. It also emphasises the importance of ensuring 
that  adequate  personal  protective  equipment  reaches  the  critical  social  support 
care  sector  providing  services  for,  for  example,  older  and  disabled  persons. 
Regarding  health  care  surge  capacities,  the  Communication  states  that  national 
strategies  should  be  in  place  to  maximise  the  ability  of  health  systems  to  cope 
with increased demand during pandemics and epidemics, highlighting that in such

instances  support  from  neighbouring  countries  and  EU  Member  States  might  be 
essential.  Furthermore,  the  Communication  underlines  that  other  areas  of 
healthcare  must  not  be  neglected  and  that  the  prioritisation  of  healthcare 
provision must be done according to guidance strictly based on medical criteria.  

On  13  October,  the  Council  adopted  a  Recommendation  on  a  coordinated 
approach  to  the  restriction  of  free  movement  in  response  to  the  COVID-19 
pandemic.75  It  aims  at  coordinating  measures  on  travel  restrictions  between 
Member  States,  making  them  more  evidence-based  and  using  a  standardised 
colour  code  for  the  risk  regions  published  by  ECDC.  It  also  encourages  Member 
States to use common criteria when considering restricting free movement, using 
measures more consistently and communicating them timelier. 

In  her first  State of  the  Union Address,76  European Commission President  Ursula 
von  der  Leyen  said  on  16  September  that  the  EU  must  “strengthen  our  crisis 
preparedness  and  management  of  cross-border  health  threats”,  mentioning  also 
that  the  Commission  will  propose  to  “reinforce  and  empower  the  European 
Medicines  Agency  and  the  European  Centre  for  Disease  Prevention  and  Control”. 
For this purpose, the European Commission is planning to propose a legal package 
in  November  2020  to  strengthen  the  health  security  framework  for  a  better  EU 
coordination of preparedness and response to serious cross-border health threats, 
based on the lessons learned from the current crisis.  

President Ursula von der Leyen also announced to “build a European BARDA – an 
agency  for  biomedical  advanced  research  and  development.”  This  new  agency 
would support the EU’s capacity and readiness to respond to cross-border threats 
and  emergencies,  and  address  supply  chain  dependencies,  notably 
for 
pharmaceutical products. 

With the Communication on the preparedness for COVID-19 vaccination strategies 
and vaccine deployment77 of 15 October the European Commission described key 
elements  to  be  taken  into  consideration  by  Member  States  for  their  COVID-19 
vaccination strategies in order to prepare the EU and its citizens for the time when 
one  or  more  safe  and  effective  vaccine(s)  is/are  available,  as  well  as  priority 
groups to consider for vaccination.

Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

International background(cid:2)

Pandemics are by definition international – preparing for them and responding to 
them  require  cooperation  across  countries  and  continents,  irrespective  of 
geopolitical alliances and in line with the United Nation’s foundational principles of 
global solidarity and justice. 

The  main  framework  for  such  international  coordination  is  the  World  Health 
Organization (WHO), the UN agency specialised in health. The WHO is empowered 
by  the  International  Health  Regulations  (IHR)  to  act  as  the  main  global  health 
surveillance  system.  The  IHR78  have  as  stated  purpose  “to  prevent,  protect 
against, control and provide a public  health  response  to  the  international  spread 
of  disease  in  ways  that  are  commensurate  with  and  restricted  to  public  health 
risks,  and  which  avoid  unnecessary  interference  with  international  traffic  and 
trade.” The IHR were adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2005 and became 
a binding instrument of international law as they entered into force in 2007. 

The pandemic preparedness of the WHO has focussed on influenza for more than 
70 years, with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System created in 
1952 and the Global Influenza Programme in 1947. These programmes enable the 
collection,  correlation  and  distribution  of 
influenza 
epidemics.  Key  documents  on  pandemic  preparedness  developed  in  this  context 
include  the  2005  “WHO  global  influenza  preparedness  plan”79  and  the  “checklist 
for  pandemic  preparedness  planning”.80  The  Pandemic  Influenza  Preparedness 
(PIP) framework was developed in response to concerns emerging after the 2006 
H5N1  epidemic.81  It  enables  the  sharing  of  samples  in  the  case  of  an  influenza 
pandemic.

In  response  to  failures  in  the  preparation  for  and  management  of  disease 
outbreaks  and  other  health  emergencies,  the  WHO  and  World  Bank  Group 
convened  the  Global  Preparedness  Monitoring  Board  (GPMB).  The  GPMB  is  an 
independent monitoring and accountability body to ensure preparedness for global 
health  crises.  Expert  panels  convened  by  the  GPMB  have  made  specific 
recommendations for reforms, summarised in the GPMB  Annual Report 2019: “A

The main lessons learnt described in the 2020 report of the GPMB are:

(cid:2) 

Political  leadership  makes  the  difference  to  protect  both  health  and  the 
economy; 

Preparedness is also about what people do to protect each other and act 
in the best interest of all;  

The impact of pandemics goes far beyond their immediate health  effects, 
and  education,  social  and  economic  sectors  need  to  be  made  “pandemic 
proof”; 

(cid:2)  Current measures of preparedness are not predictive: ‘National measures 
of  preparedness  have  not  predicted  the  effectiveness  of  countries’ 
response  in  stopping  viral  spread  and  saving  lives,  and  the  critical 
importance  of  social  protection  has  been  neglected.  The  ultimate  test  of 
preparedness is response’; 

(cid:2) 

Expenditure  for  prevention  and  preparedness  give  a  very  high  return  on 
investment. 

In  general,  up  to  date  intelligence  on  potential  infectious  diseases  threats 
worldwide  is  essential  to  ensure  early  and  effective  European  preparedness  and 
response.  This  will  require  strengthening  bilateral  and  multilateral  international 
collaboration the EU and third countries, including through existing and additional 
programmes in research, information sharing, and strengthening of public health 
institutions in vulnerable low income countries. 

Relation between the WHO and the EU 

The European Commission has long-standing bilateral relations with the WHO. The 
current  relations  are  based  on  an  exchange  of  letters  in  2001,  aiming  to 
consolidate  the  cooperation  between  the  two  organisations.  The  WHO  office  in 
Brussels  facilitates  relations  between  the  WHO  and  the  EU,  whereas  the  WHO 
regional office for Europe in Copenhagen serves the WHO European Region, which 
comprises  53  countries.  Their  staff  are  public  health,  scientific  and  technical 
experts,  based  in  the  main  office  in  Copenhagen,  Denmark,  in  five  technical 
centres  and  in  country  offices  in  30  Member  States.  One  of  the  areas  of 
cooperation  between  the EU  and  WHO  is  on antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR),  with 
amongst  others  the  one-health  action  plan  of  the  EU  contributing  to  the  global 
agenda.

EU structures for pandemic preparedness 

The  1998  Decision  setting  up  a  network  for  the  epidemiological  surveillance  and 
control of communicable diseases in the Community,84  led  to  the  creation  of  the 
Early Warning and Response System. In 2004, the EU Health Security Committee 
was given the responsibility for pandemic preparedness.  

The  main  EU  structure  dealing  with  pandemic  preparedness  is  the  EU  agency 
European  Centre  for  Disease  Control  (ECDC).  It  was  established  in  2005  with 
pandemic  preparedness  as  its  priority.  Its  mission  includes  the  collection, 
evaluation and dissemination of scientific data; the provision of scientific opinions 
and  training;  the  coordination  of  the  European  network  of  relevant  bodies  and 
operating  surveillance  networks;  and  the  exchange  of  information.  The  ECDC 
supports,  together  with  the  WHO,  the  development  of  national  “Pandemic 
Preparedness  Plans”  by  providing  guidance.  It  does not  have  laboratory  facilities 
itself.  

During  the  2009  Influenza  A  (H1N1)  outbreak,  the  ECDC  and  the  WHO  (Europe 
regional office) both operated next to  each other. The review by the WHO of the 
IHR and the handling on the H1N1 pandemic led to the publication in 2010 of the 
“Recommendations  for  good  practice  in  pandemic  preparedness:  identified 
through  evaluation  of  the  response  to  pandemic  (H1N1)  2009”85  The  authors 
expressed  concerns  about  “under-planning”,  and  the  need  for  the  WHO  to 
coordinate better with the ECDC.

8.  RECOMMENDATIONS 

As  science  and  ethics  policy  advisors  we  have  examined  the  responses  to  the 
COVID-19 and, in part, previous pandemics, identified important lessons learned 
and to be learned and formulated the following recommendations to support the 
European  Commission’s  efforts  in  strengthening  Europe’s  preparedness  for,  and 
management of, future pandemics and epidemics.  

This  is  a  collaboration  between  the  European  Commission’s  Group  of  Chief 
Scientific  Advisors,  the  European  Group  on  Ethics  in  Science  and  New 
Technologies  and  the  Special  Advisor  to  the  President  of  the  European 
Commission on the response to COVID-19 and brings together different disciplines 
and  perspectives.  It  analyses  the  complexity  of  pandemics  drawing  on  insights 
from  research  and  scholarship  and  taking  European  values  and  respect  for 
fundamental rights as critical orientation. 

Scientific  advice  in  an  ongoing  crisis,  as  indicated  in  our  first  joint  statement 
(Statement  on  scientific  advice  to  European  policy  makers  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic, June 2020), needs to be transparent, based on high quality evidence, 
adaptive  and  open  to  scientific  scrutiny.  Science  and  scientific  advice  do  not 
emerge  from  value-free  spaces  and  can  be  interpreted,  weighed  and  applied  in 
different ways. This is where values, ethics and fundamental rights matter as they 
inform interpretations and decisions in the course of science and actions taken on 
the basis of science.  

The outbreak of infectious disease causes a broader societal crisis and  highlights 
pre-existing  social  ills.  This  requires  responses  to  be  of  a  holistic  nature, 
addressing  all  aspects  and  causes  of  the  crisis  and  their  complex  interplay  in  an 
interdisciplinary framework, which aims at sustainable recovery and resilience by 
building strong and solidarity-based institutions.  

The  lessons  learned  have  identified  the  limitations  of  an  ad-hoc  approach  to 
health  crises:  pre-established  networks,  systems  and  infrastructure  would  have 
enabled a more rapid and coordinated response – crucial in the early phase of an 
outbreak.  Many  of  our  following  recommendations  require  EU-level  collaboration 
with coordinated management, which could be performed by agencies such as the 
proposed  Biomedical  Advanced  Research  and  Development  Authority  (BARDA)-
like  structure,  building  on  properly  resourced  existing  elements,  such  as  the 
European  Centre  for  Disease  Prevention  and  Control  (ECDC)  and  the  European 
Medicines  Agency  (EMA).  We  therefore  endorse  the  European  Commission’s 
proposals concerning the respective creation and strengthening of these agencies. 

Successful  pandemic  management  and  preparedness  need  to  be  based  on 
European  and  international  collaboration,  driven  by  the  long-standing  European 
values  of  openness,  cooperation  and  solidarity  –  understood  as  practices  and 
institutions of mutual support among all people and all Members States in Europe, 
with particular attention to the needs of the vulnerable. The COVID-19 pandemic

has  highlighted  the  inter-dependency  of  people  and  other  species,  mutual 
vulnerabilities  and  the  need  for  shared  responsibilities  within  and  between  the 
Member  States  of  the  European  Union,  as  well  as  internationally.  Cross-border 
health  threats  such  as  pandemics  do  not  stop  at  the  EU  borders.  The  COVID-19 
pandemic  is  not  going  to  be  over  anywhere,  until  it  is  over  everywhere, 
worldwide.  The 
inter-dependency  extends  to  humans,  animals  and  the 
environment,  and  it  encompasses  health,  economic,  social  and  cultural  sectors. 
Pandemics  preparedness  and  management  is  a  collective  capability  of  the  whole 
EU as part of the international community, based on building resilience. 

Each epidemic or pandemic affects societies and different parts and members of a 
society in different ways. Each outbreak has its own specific characteristics. There 
cannot be a single preparedness and management strategy. What is needed is a 
toolbox  of  flexible  strategies  that  can  be  adjusted  and  further  developed  in  a 
particular epidemiological, economic, social and cultural context.  

On this basis, we recommend the European Commission to:  

1.  PREVENT AND PRE-EMPT 

including 

infectious  diseases  globally, 

(cid:2)  Support  multifaceted  efforts  to  investigate,  map  and  reduce  the 
risk  of  emerging 
the 
surveillance  of  pathogen  reservoirs,  mitigation,  forecasting  and  early 
detection of potential outbreaks. This entails proactive pathogen discovery 
in  wildlife  and  livestock  populations  and  understanding  the  mechanisms 
and risks of cross-species host-switching, coupled with  prevention efforts 
against  spillover of  pathogens  to  humans  and  the  monitoring  of  spillover 
events when they do occur, as well as modelling of the potential spread of 
emerging  pathogens.  This  will  involve  a  strong  global  collaboration  built 
on a combination of research, awareness raising, biosecurity and biosafety 
improvements and capacity building. 

(cid:2)  Support  a  combination  of  complementary  approaches 

for 
accelerating  the  research  on  and  development  of  responses  to 
pathogens  with  epidemic  and  pandemic  potential,  including  (1) 
(2)  pathogen-independent  platform-based 
pathogen-specific  work; 
technology;  and  (3)  prototype-pathogen  efforts  at  European  and 
international  level  in  collaboration  with  governments,  non-government 
organisations and private companies. 

(cid:2)  Strengthen  multi-  and  cross-disciplinary  research  on  pandemic 
prevention,  preparedness,  responses  and  impacts.  This  should 
include biomedical studies as well as studies on societal dimensions, such 
as  social,  cultural  and  economic  habits  increasing  the  risk  of  outbreaks, 
socio-economic  and  psychosocial  consequences  of  pandemics  and  of 
mitigation  measures  and  broader  questions  of  epidemic-resilient  societal 
structures,  for  example  with  regard  to  health  inequalities,  poverty, 
employment,  gender,  ageing,  housing,  urbanism  and  rurality,  mobility, 
environmental sustainability and legal and governance frameworks. These

efforts  should  also  cover  analyses  of  public  and  policy  discourses  related 
to pandemic responses that have the potential to homogenise, stigmatise 
and  problematize  different  population  groups.  Specific  investigations  into 
effective  testing,  tracing  and  isolating  strategies  (TTI)  and  other 
monitoring  and  containment  strategies,  such  as  sector-specific 
approaches, to avoid closures of public institutions and borders as well as 
impairment  of  public

development,  effectiveness,  necessity  and  proportionality  of  pan-
European,  interoperable  technologies  in  the  management  of  epidemics 
and  pandemics  are  also  recommended,  acknowledging  the  social  and 
ethical  dimensions  of  their  development  and  implementation,  and 
addressing  potentials  and  risks  to  dignity  and  fundamental  rights  and 
freedoms.

2.  ENHANCE  COORDINATION  ACROSS  MEMBER  STATES  AND  AT 

INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 

(cid:2)  Establish  a  standing  EU  advisory  body  for  health  threats  and 
crises,  including  epidemics  and  pandemics.  This  body  should  have  a 
multidisciplinary and inclusive membership so it can advise on biomedical, 
behavioural,  social,  economic,  cultural,  ethical,  legal,  technological  and 
international aspects. Its composition and functioning should also respond 
to the challenges and requirements involved by its role in advising on new 
and  surprising  questions  and  complex  and  changing  situations,  as  it  will 
need  to  be  expert,  farsighted,  rapid,  flexible  and  creative,  while  often 
facing  the  unknown,  uncertainties  and  chaos.  It  should  have  liaisons  to 
representatives  from  relevant  advisory  bodies  in  the  Member  States,  at 
EU-level,  including  the  ECDC,  and  internationally  to  ensure  EU-wide  and 
global sharing and exchange of information. The result should be a shared 
evidence-base  about  effective  and  socially  and  economically  sustainable 
mitigation  and  management  strategies  for  health  threats  and  crises, 
including  epidemics  and  pandemics.  The  envisaged  EU  advisory  body 
would also ensure that the advice provided to Member State governments 
and the European Commission is consistent, with differences in advice to 
different Member States clarified and clearly communicated. It would also 
ensure  that  key  criteria  guide  EU  coordination  regarding  international 
concerns  such  as  travel,  ensuring  coherence  and  non-discrimination 
among Member States. 

(cid:2)  Ensure  that  monitoring  efforts  are  comprehensive,  evidence-
based, rapidly shared and well-coordinated across the EU, enabling 
strategic  decisions  in  response  to  the  situation  at  hand,  insights  through 
real-time comparisons, as well as collective action where appropriate. The 
COVID-19  pandemic  highlighted  that  even  key  indicators,  such  as  the 
number  of  deaths,  were  measured  and  assessed  differently  among 
Member  States,  hindering  effective 
insights  and 
comparisons. For instance, the exclusion of deaths in nursing homes from 
official numbers in some Member States established practical barriers with

respect  to  identifying  clustering  patterns  and  targeting  and  designing 
responses,  and  symbolic  challenges  with  respect  to  communicating  and 
pursuing  inclusive  mitigating  strategies.  Moreover,  indicators  were  often 
limited to biomedical aspects, preventing a more complete assessment of 
the  crisis  and  the  effects  of  implemented  measures.  A  European 
Dashboard  with  information  from  all  Member  States  about  the  medical, 
economic  and  social  impacts  would  be  helpful,  also  for  transparency  and 
communication to the public. The Dashboard should also include indicators 
on  unemployment  and  poverty,  social  isolation  and  social  exclusion, 
school attendance, limitations of civil liberties and fundamental rights, as 
well  as  containment  measures.  Therefore,  a  European  data  platform, 
strategy  and  infrastructure  for  preparedness  and  management  of  health 
crises is recommended. 

(cid:2)  Establish  a  joint  early-response  mechanism  to  contain  epidemics 
and  pandemics,  including  a  toolbox  of  strategies,  such  as  testing, 
tracing, isolating as well as local/regional/national containment measures. 
Any  strategy  needs  to  be  based  on  scientific  evidence,  guided  by  the 
fundamental  rights  framework  and  applied  in  a  situation-dependent 
manner.  Herd  immunity  is  a  concept  best  applied  in  the  context  of 
vaccine-acquired  immunity.  Achieving  herd  immunity  through  natural 
infection  by  a  previously  unknown  pathogen  involving  risks  to  life  and 
health conflicts with the WHO’s ethical framework and its multi-principled 
approach,  requiring  that  utility  and  equity  considerations  are  balanced. 
The  moral  equality  of  all  persons  means  that  the  lives  of  vulnerable 
members of society must be considered to have equal value to the lives of 
those  at  less  risk.  Achieving  a  state  where  a  sufficient  share  of  the 
population  has  become  immune  as  a  result  of  natural  infection  can  also 
create  practical  challenges  regarding  the  protection  of  vulnerable 
populations, overburden health care systems and result in a high number 
of deaths and long-term morbidity. 

(cid:2)  Coordinate  research  and  the  development  and  implementation  of 
medical  countermeasures  during  a  pandemic  or  other  health 
threat.  Crucial  scientific  questions  should  be  clarified  as  quickly  as 
possible after the onset of a health threat such as a pandemic  to rapidly 
inform  effective  and  safe  public  health  measures.  These  questions  relate 
to, 
for  example,  distinctive  molecular  characteristics,  means  of 
transmission,  the  type  and  duration  of  the  natural  immune  response  to 
the pathogen, the clinical picture and the course of the disease in different 
populations.  Research  efforts  should  be  coordinated  and  findings  and 
insights shared at  European and international levels to make best use of 
limited resources to accelerate the acquisition of scientific understanding. 
Initiatives  similar  to  the  ERAvsCorona  Action  Plan  can  facilitate  such 
coordination  at  a  European  level.  Similarly,  EU  coordination  of  the 
development and implementation of diagnostic tests and clinical trials for 
the  development  of  treatments  and  vaccines  can  avoid  fragmentation  of 
studies, duplication, or competition for trial participants and help to secure 
the  generation  of  robust  evidence.  We  recommend  the  establishment  of 

74                                              November 2020

an  EU-wide  network  of  large-scale,  multi-centric  clinical  trials  for  both 
therapeutics and vaccines, to ensure that regulatory requirements are met 
and  to  inform  public  health  policies.  For  treatments,  we  recommend 
supporting  adaptive  trials  using  a  pre-developed  and  ethically  approved 
master  protocol,  and  allowing  therapeutic options  to  change  according  to 
interim  results  and  newly  emerging  candidate  treatments.  To  safeguard 
the efficacy and safety of newly developed vaccines and treatments when 
using  accelerated  procedures,  it  is  necessary  to  coordinate  trials  in  all 
phases,  including  a  sufficiently  high  number  of  volunteers  from  different 
population  groups  and  risk  groups.  The  obtained  results  are  essential  to 
inform  public  health  choices  including  the  development  of  optimal 
vaccination strategies. 

(cid:2)  Coordinate research and the development and evaluation of social 
measures  to  mitigate  harm  and  to  increase  resilience  in  case  of 
pandemics  or  other  public  health  crises.  Social,  economic,  ethical, 
psychosocial  and  cultural  challenges  raised  by  a  pandemic  should  be 
addressed  as  quickly  as  possible  after  its  onset  to  inform  a  range  of 
nuanced  and  locally  appropriate  measures.  These  challenges  may  relate 
to,  for  example,  income  and  housing  security,  age,  disability,  health, 
gender and educational equality, psychosocial and domestic wellbeing and 
social,  cultural  and  religious  needs.  Research  should  also  investigate  the 
effects,  proportionality  and  perceptions  of  mitigation  measures  during  a 
pandemic,  their  communication  and  discourses  they  give  rise  to,  as  well 
as questions of trust and social cohesion, so that lessons can be drawn for 
the future. Research should also investigate and inform the development 
of  inter-sectoral  frameworks  to  integrate  public  health,  social  and 
economic  considerations  and  support  decision  making  and  policy 
development  during  public  health  crises.  Results  should  be  shared  at 
European and international levels to deepen the understanding of complex 
societal reactions during pandemics and inform governing bodies on how 
insecurities  created  by  pandemics  and  containment  measures  can  be 
countered  through  social  support  measures,  from  inclusive  emergency 
financial  aid  schemes  of  different  kinds  to  ad-hoc  strengthening  of 
institutions providing community support. 

3.  STRENGTHEN SYSTEMS FOR PREPAREDNESS AND MANAGEMENT 

(cid:2)  Encourage  Member  States  to  provide  healthcare  for  all,  respecting 
the  principles  of  justice  and  solidarity  and  adhering  to  the  commitments 
established  in  the  context  of  European  fundamental  rights  instruments, 
such  as  the  European  Pillar  of  Social  Rights,  and  the  Sustainable 
Development  Goals.  Member  States  should  account  for  the  resources 
needed  to  maintain  high-quality,  evidence-based  continuity  of  care  of 
people  with  other  health  problems,  including  workforce  and  service 
capacity needs, and a robust referral and diagnostics service. They should 
also  ensure  that  settings  that  care  for  older  adults  and  other  vulnerable

groups  are  better  prepared  for  future  waves  of  this  pandemic  and  other 
pandemics. 

(cid:2)  Ensure  robust  and  equitable  access  to  critical  products  and 
services  for  all  EU  citizens  and  demonstrate  global  solidarity.  This 
involves  pre-emptively  providing  criteria  for  the  allocation,  among  and 
within  Member  States,  of  limited  resources  essential  to  manage  a 
pandemic and mitigate harm, with due regard to the moral equality of all 
persons.  This  includes  treatments  and  vaccines,  but  also  specialised 
professionals that  are  in  increased  demand  during pandemics,  as  well  as 
key  infrastructures,  technologies  and  devices.  Allocations  should  follow 
fair,  needs-based  criteria  built  on  European  values  of  solidarity,  equity, 
non-discrimination  and  social  justice,  paying  particular  attention  to 
disadvantaged  groups,  such  as  older  adults,  chronically  ill  and  disabled 
persons,  as  well  as  disadvantaged  regions,  also  beyond  the  EU.  The 
complimentary  concepts  of  ’inclusion  health’,  where  health  services  are 
operationalised  to  address  health  and  social  inequities,  and  ’linked  lives’, 
where  people  lead  mutually  influential  interlocked  lives,  may  provide 
useful  orientating  policy  concepts  to  ensure 
fairness.  Prior 
laboratories,  production 
identification  and  amplification  of  suitable 
facilities  and  adequate  logistical  workflows  is  recommended.  Existing 
facilities  may  be  repurposed  in  the  case  of  emergencies  to  ensure  the 
availability,  affordability  and  accessibility  to  a  sufficient  supply  of 
resources  in  all  Member  States.  Steps  should  be  taken  to  ensure  that 
patent  rights  and  pricing  are  not  barriers  to  the  availability  and 
affordability  of  necessary  treatments  and  vaccines,  especially  in  less 
advantaged  countries.  The  EU  should  strengthen  its  capacities  for,  and 
research  and  development, 
accelerate,  clinical  and  non-clinical 
authorisation,  manufacturing  and  stockpiling  of  medicinal  products, 
diagnostic testing material and personal  protective  equipment  to  address 
supply  chain  dependencies  and  to  ensure  availability  of  critical  medicinal 
products and services in Europe in the case of pandemics and other health 
crises.  An  EU  Biomedical  Advanced  Research  and  Development  Authority 
(BARDA)-like structure could serve this purpose, tailored to the European 
context and properly resourced. It should closely collaborate with relevant 
existing  structures  at  European  and  national  level,  including  relevant 
industries.

will  require  reliable  and  sustainable  funding  streams  as  well  as  political 
leadership. 

(cid:2)  Establish  systems  for  effective  risk  communication  and  tackling 
disinformation and misinformation during crises and strengthen the 
ECDC’s  role  also  in  this  regard.  Develop  communication  strategies  for 
advice  and  policy  that  are  evidence-based,  fit  for  purpose,  flexible  and 
nuanced and that counter stigmatising and homogenising discourses that 
serve to exclude and marginalise. Both scientific advice and considerations 
on the values and rights at play should be communicated. Leadership by 
example,  as  well  as  clear,  sustained  and  transparent  communication  on 
public health measures, including on the science underlying them, as well 
as on scientific uncertainties and controversies and the reasons for which 
advice  and  policy  may  diverge  across  different  societies,  are  crucial  for 
maintaining  public  trust  and  pro-social  behaviours  during  a  pandemic. 
Trust  is  particularly  critical  if  the  public  are  to  have  confidence  in  their 
political  leaders  and  is  especially  required  when  onerous  demands  are 
made on personal behaviour. Simultaneously, it is recommended to follow 
the best available knowledge and practice to further develop policy efforts 
tackling  disinformation  and  misinformation  during  and  beyond  epidemics 
and pandemics. Among them are ‘pre-bunking’ or ‘inoculation’ approaches 
to  counter  false  claims,  for  example  on  vaccines  or  risk  mitigation 
measures, and community engagement approaches involving the hesitant 
segments  of  the  public  through  ‘trust  chains’.  Bolstering  health  literacy 
would  empower  individuals  to  take  informed  health  decisions  during 
pandemics,  contribute  to  curbing  the  spread  of  disinformation  and 
misinformation,  promote  healthy  lifestyles  in  the  long  term  and  insulate 
populations  from  underlying  health  conditions  which  make  them  more 
vulnerable to infectious disease threats.

ground  problems  faced  during  pandemics,  such  as  purchasing  aid 
initiatives and the ad-hoc provision of housing and sanitation solutions for 
those in need. It moreover acknowledges  and supports the  work of civil-
society organisations providing a critical part of the intensified social and 
care  work  during  health  crises.  Special  attention  needs  to  be  paid  to 
grass-roots organisations who are led by members of at-risk populations, 
such  as  older  people  and  people  living  with  disabilities,  whose  activities 
and  voices  can  be  significantly  constrained  as  a  consequence  of  the 
pandemic and its related response measures.  

(cid:2)  Foster  the  exploitation  of  the  possibilities  of  appropriate 
engineering and other controls in public buildings to limit infection 
risk  indoors  for  air  borne  diseases,  such  as  sufficient  and  effective 
ventilation,  possibly  enhanced  by  particle  filtration  and  air  disinfection, 
avoiding  air  recirculation  and  overcrowding.  Such  measures  can  help  to 
avoid the need for applying more invasive and restrictive measures such 
as the closure of educational institutions and work places.  

4.  UPHOLD FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND STRENGTHEN SOCIAL JUSTICE 

(cid:2)  Uphold  highest  standards  in  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights 
and  civil  liberties  during  pandemics,  guided  by  the  Charter  of 
Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Siracusa Principles on 
the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on 
Civil  and  Political  Rights86.  In  the  rare  case  of  encroachments  on  rights 
and  liberties  to  limit  harm  and  risks  during  pandemics  they  should  be 
considered  only  with  utmost  care,  be  explicitly  limited  in  time, 
continuously  reviewed  and  justified  with  respect  to  their  necessity  and 
proportionality  and  lifted  as  soon  as  possible.  The  various  efforts  to 
develop  digital  tracing  and  tracking  applications  during  the  current 
pandemic and the discussions raised by them have pointed to the need for 
great  caution  in  this,  but  also  to  the  possibility  of  mitigation  measures 
being in line with and guided by European values and fundamental rights. 

(cid:2) 

Implement  the  European  Pillar  of  Social  Rights  by  extending  social

value  of  care  work;  ensuring  access  to  care  services  of  good  quality,  in

poverty and precariousness are both a social and a medical risk factor, all 
relevant  actors  should  implement  appropriate  short-time  measures  to 
alleviate the greatest and most immediate harms caused by a pandemic, 
such  as  emergency  financial  aid  schemes  for  all  persons  in  need, 
regardless  of  their  occupational  status,  and  implement  long-term 
measures  to  alleviate  poverty,  precariousness  and  social  exclusion  in  a 
sustainable manner. 

5.  FIND SOLIDARITY-BASED AND SUSTAINABLE WAYS OF LIVING 

During  the  work  on  this  joint  Opinion,  considerations  emerged  that  go  beyond 
pandemic  preparedness  and  management  in  the  narrow  sense,  but  are  very 
relevant in their context. The COVID-19 crisis can also be seen as an opportunity 
to address systemic issues. Therefore, we recommend the European Commission 
to:  

(cid:2) 

Take  action  in  a  cross-cutting  manner  upon  the  increasing  body  of 
knowledge  about  unsustainable  ways  of  living,  which  also  contribute  to 
the emergence of epidemics and pandemics. This includes addressing the 
links  between  health  crises  and  environmental  degradation  from  a 
‘planetary  health’  perspective  and  to  devise  new  and  update  existing 
policies in related fields, such as environmental protection, food, transport 
and  urban  planning.  It  also  includes  addressing  the  links  between  health 
crises,  poverty  and  structural  inequalities,  expressing  themselves  in 
‘syndemic  pandemics’,  and  to  devise  new  and  update  existing  policies  in 
related fields, such as employment, housing, social and economic aspects 
of  ageing,  gender  and  migration.  A  solidary  and  sustainable  governance 
approach and the resulting trust in governance structures are at the core 
of  resilience.  We  recommend  to  initiate  and  promote  societal  (including 
scholarly) debates about how to set conditions for strengthening systemic 
resilience  to  crises  including,  but  not  restricted to pandemics. Continuing 
this collaboration in 2021, it is our plan to provide a third joint advice on 
how Europe can develop towards stronger resilience.

Joint Opinion 
Improving pandemic preparedness and management 

Annex 1 – Methodology  

This  joint  Opinion  is  a  collaboration  between  the  Group  of  Chief  Scientific 
Advisors, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE), 
and  Peter  Piot  as  Special  Advisor  to  European  Commission  President  Ursula  von 
der Leyen on the response to the coronavirus and COVID-19 – hereafter the ‘joint 
advisors’. 

In their joint statement on scientific advice to European policy makers during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the joint advisors announced to produce the current Opinion 
“on  the  management  of  pandemics  more  generally”.  Work  on  this  joint  Opinion 
started directly following the publication of the statement on 24 June 2020. 

A  steering  group  was  formed  to  lead  the  development  of  the  joint  Opinion  on 
behalf  of  all  joint  advisors.  The  steering  group  consisted  of  Pearl  Dykstra,  Éva 
Kondorosi,  Paul  Nurse  and  Rolf-Dieter  Heuer  (GCSA);  Christiane  Woopen  and 
Siobhán O'Sullivan (EGE); Peter Piot (Special Advisor to the European Commission 
President);  and  Janusz  Bujnicki  (former  member  of  the  Group  of  Chief  Scientific 
Advisors). The work of the steering group was led by Pearl Dykstra and Christiane 
Woopen. 

A  project  team  consisting  of  staff  from  the  SAM  secretariat  (supporting  the 
GCSA),  the  EGE  team  and  the  team  of  Peter  Piot  was  assembled  to  support  the 
work of the joint advisors. 

The main question to be addressed by this joint Opinion was formulated as: ‘How 
can  Europe  ensure  adequate  management  of  and  better  preparedness  for 
epidemics  and  pandemics?’  The  advisors  agreed  to  build  the  answers  to  this 
question on lessons learned from the COVID-19 and selected previous epidemics 
and  pandemics.  A  broad  scope  was  taken  to  address  this  question,  covering  an 
extensive range of matters and disciplines to adequately cover the wide spectrum 
of causes, drivers, developments and consequences of epidemics and pandemics. 

The steering group instructed the project team to undertake, in July and August, a 
rapid  scoping  review  of  existing  advice  on  pandemic  preparedness,  as  well  as 
targeted  rapid  evidence  reviews  of  diverse  areas  where  lessons  could  be learned 
from the COVID-19 pandemic and earlier epidemics or pandemics. These reviews 
covered  searches  in  databases  for  academic  literature  and  ‘grey  literature’  (e.g. 
official  reports),  web  searches,  as  well  as  suggestions  and  contributions  by  the 
advisors.  All  input  was  assessed  and  synthesised  by  the  project  team  to  inform 
the  deliberations  of  the  steering  group,  and  formed  the  basis  for  this  joint 
Opinion.  At  the  instructions  of  the  steering  group,  the  project  team  undertook 
further  targeted  rapid  evidence  reviews  when  additional  considerations  emerged 
during the elaboration of the joint Opinion. 

Developing  this  Opinion  during  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  meant  working 
with the rapidly evolving nature of the still limited understanding of and tentative 
conclusions  about  the  pandemic,  the  effectiveness  of  responses  to  it,  and  the

consequences thereof. New evidence and insights are continuously developed and 
updated,  which  are  published  with  some  delay  in  peer-reviewed  literature.  The 
project  team  therefore  also  assessed  –  throughout  the  development  of  the  joint 
Opinion  –  pre-prints  and  online  articles,  including  blog-posts  by  researchers  and 
scholars, which could provide insightful preliminary information.  

Simultaneously  in  July,  the  steering  group  requested  SAPEA  to  identify  experts 
from  a  wide  range  of  disciplines  who  could  be  consulted  to  fill  knowledge  gaps, 
identify  key  evidence  and  ‘fact-check’  drafts.  To  this  end,  SAPEA  launched  a  call 
for nominations of experts, which was open until the end of August. Based on the 
results of this call for nominations, expert elicitation took place during October in 
a distributed manner and in writing. Experts were directly contacted by the joint 
advisors or, under the direction of the steering group, by the project team on an 
individual  basis.  They  were  requested  to  contribute  insights  and  evidence  on 
targeted questions to inform the deliberations of the joint advisors. A draft of the 
Opinion,  as  well  as  the  final  agreed  recommendations,  was  sent  to  a  diverse 
group  of  experts  for  their  insights  and  for  fact-checking.  A  list  of  consulted 
experts providing significant input can be found in Annex 2. 

In  October,  a  draft  of  this  joint  Opinion  was  also  shared  with  relevant  European 
Commission policy makers, in particular in DG SANTE,  so it could already inform 
the  development  of  a  package  of  legislative  proposals  to  strengthen  the  health 
security framework for a better EU coordination of preparedness and response to 
serious  cross-border  health  threats.  At  the  same  time,  the  policy  makers  were 
requested to fact-check the policy context section of the Opinion. 

The  Opinion  was  endorsed  by  all  joint  advisors  and  published  on  11  November 
2020.

to do so. The COVID-19 crisis has shown that there is need to understand 
how Europe can ensure better management of and preparedness for 
them. This joint advice builds on lessons learned from the current and 
from previous pandemics. It analyses their complexity, drawing on insights 
from research and scholarship and taking European values and respect for 
fundamental rights as critical orientation.

It is developed jointly by the European Commission’s independent Group 
of Chief Scientiﬁ c Advisors, the European Group on Ethics in Science and 
New Technologies (EGE) and Peter Piot, Special Advisor to the President of 
the European Commission on the response to COVID-19. 

Their recommendations include strengthened European and global 
solidarity and coordination in governance, research and community eﬀ orts 
to improve pandemic preparedness and management. This should address 
all aspects and causes of pandemics in their complex interplay, from 
biomedical and health to social and environmental ones. The advice covers 
eﬀ orts to prevent and pre-empt future pandemics; more coordinated 
response structures and mechanisms; the strengthening of essential 
systems, including healthcare, supply chains, public health, information 
and education; and protecting fundamental rights and social justice.

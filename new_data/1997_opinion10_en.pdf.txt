1.3 

The originality of the request for an opinion submitted to the GAEIB lies in the
fact that it does not concern a particular ethical issue but, in a more general way,
the ethical aspects of the 5th Research Framework Programme as a whole.

In accordance with its mandate, the GAEIB confines itself in the present opinion
to the ethical aspects of research into the life sciences.

It  still  remains  that  other  fields  of  research  covered  by  the  5th  Framework
Programme  also  raise  ethical  issues  of  such  a  nature  as  to  justify  an  ethical
assessment.

Research  carried  out  at  Community  level  in  the  field  of  Life  Sciences  is  of
particular  interest  as  it  enables  us  to  promote  an  interdisciplinary  approach,
refine experiments and, as a consequence, improve the relationship between the
benefits  of  a  research  project  and  the  ethical  constraints  the  project  entails,
especially when it comes to experiments on humans or animals.

Research  at  Community  level  is  even  more  justifiable  in  those  areas  where  no
economic incentives exist. This is the case for fundamental research, necessary to
increase knowledge  in  Europe,  and also  in the field of rare diseases for which
only limited data (epidemiological data, for instance) are available on a national
level. In addition, the combination of the Member States’ research resources, in
rare diseases responds to the ethical principle of solidarity.

into  bioethics  and  social  sciences 

Research 
is  necessary  both  for  an
understanding  of  the  ethical  implications  of  research  into  biotechnology  and
genetics  and for the ethical assessment of this research. Thus, bioethics research
and research ethics are complementary.

Although the concept of Europe is based on respect for national differences and
identities,  it  relies  on  strong  common  values.  Thus,  Europe’s  cultural  tradition
recognizes the value of freedom of research as a fundamental human freedom.

During  the  3rd  (1991-1994)  and  4th  (1994-1998)  Community  Framework
Programmes, bioethics research initially concerned only issues related to human
genome research, before being extended to issues raised by medical research and,
finally, to all areas of research into the Life Sciences.

At the same time, an ethical assessment of research projects has gradually been
established,  by  introducing  specific  procedures  concerning  particular  categories
of  research  (projects  making  use  of  embryonic  or  fetal  human  tissues,  for
instance).

1.10 

In  the absence  of  normative competences  of  the  European  Community  in  areas
particularly  concerned  with  bioethics  research  and  health,  it  is,  for  the
Commission  to  submit  the  research  projects  that  it  finances  to  certain
requirements and to an ethical evaluation.

2.1 

2.2 

The  fundamental  ethical  issues  raised  by  research  into  Life  Sciences  and  the
resulting  applications  justify  the  definition  of  ethical  conditions  governing
research.  In  this  respect,  the  innovative  reference  to  “fundamental  ethical
principles” in Article 6 of the 5th Framework Programme is entirely appropriate.

These  ethical  conditions  must  be  applied  in  such  a  way  as  to  respect  the
fundamental  principle  of  freedom  of  research,  which  flows  from  freedom  of
thought.  Research  ethics  must  therefore  seek  to  reconcile  the  freedom  to  carry
out  research  activities  with(cid:3) the  imperatives  linked  to  the  protection  of  the
fundamental  rights  of  European  citizens  and  human  responsibilities  towards
animals and the environment.

2.3  Without prejudice to the Member States’ competence with regard to research, in
the context of national regulations, the Commission should ensure that an ethical
assessment  is made of the  research  projects  submitted  to  it,  and  must  therefore
set up appropriate procedures.

2.4  With regard to the ethical assessment of research projects, it is worth making a

distinction between three levels, viz.

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

the  research  project,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  modalities  of
implementation;

the  declared  aims  of  the  research  and  the  envisaged  applications  of  the
results;

possible  uses  and  consequences,  in  the  medium  and  long  term,  of  the
research  and  its  results  on  individuals,  the  environment  and  society  in
general.

The  first  level  should  systematically  give  rise  to  an  ethical  assessment  in  the
context of the Community research programmes.

The second level can and should also be the subject of an ethical assessment.

The  third  level  of  assessment  should  only  be  taken  into  consideration
exceptionally,  where  the  research  project  immediately  and  manifestly  raises
strong ethical concerns.

2.5 

For an ethical assessment of a research project submitted to the Commission, the
author should specify:

–  a precise description of the modalities of implementation of the project;

–  a  description  of  the  objective  of  the  project,  with  an  indication  of  the

envisaged applications of the results, where appropriate;

–  indication  of  the  national  and  international  rules  and  regulations  applicable,
and an explanation of how the researchers will face up to their obligations.

If opinions have already been obtained from local ethics committees as required
by  national  regulations,(cid:3) they  should  be  attached  by  applicants  when  submitting
project  proposals.  At  all  events,  the  requisite  authorisations  must  have  been
obtained by the time research contracts are concluded.

2.6 

Ethical  assessments  of  Community  research  projects  should  in  principle  be
carried  out  during  the  course  of  scientific  assessments;  where  appropriate  (for
instance,  if  the  issues  in  question  are  particularly  sensitive),  they  may  also  be
carried  out 
  later  by  independent  panels  of  experts,  of  pluralist  and
multidisciplinary composition.

2.7 

Special attention should be paid to the ethical assessment of research projects in
the most sensitive areas, in particular those where the Member States’ legislation

5

differs.  Differences  in  approach  among  national  legislations  cannot  a  priori  be
grounds for excluding such research from the 5th Framework Programme.

2.8 

The  first  level  of  ethical  assessment  concerns  all  research,  whether  it  involves
human beings, animals or plants.

2.9  Where  research  involving  human  beings  is  concerned,  the  fundamental  ethical
principles applicable are those recognized in international texts and in particular:

–  the  principle  of  individual  autonomy  (entailing  the  giving  of  informed
consent,  and  respect  for  privacy  and  particularly  the  confidentiality  of
personal data);

–  the principle of respect for human dignity;

–  the principle of non-discrimination (in particular vis-à-vis individuals who are

in a position to take part in the research);

–  the principle of proportionality (in particular between risks and benefits);

–  the  principle  of  non-exploitation  (to  protect  individuals  from  pressure,  in

particular economic inducement);

–  the  principle  of  protection  for  groups  of  vulnerable  people,  particularly
concerning  consent  (while  not  excluding  them  from  any  potential  direct  or
indirect benefits of participation in the research).

2.10  With  regard  to  animal  experimentation,  the  ethical  principles  applicable  are  in

particular:

–  replacement (by alternative methods),

–  reduction (in the number of animals);

–  refinement (making it possible to limit the number of experiments).

Animal suffering must be avoided or kept to a minimum taking into account the
benefits  expected  from  the  research.    These  principles  must  be  applied
particularly rigorously to the animal species that are the closest to human beings.
Research  involving  transgenesis  and/or  the  cloning  of  animals  calls  for  a
particularly high level of ethical vigilance.

2.11  With regard to research on plants or micro-organisms, the ethical principles to be
observed concern respect  for proportionality between the expected benefits  and
the risks vis-à-vis human health and the environment, and vigilance with regard
to biodiversity.

2.12  The second level of assessment concerning the declared aims of the project and
the envisaged applications of the results, entails taking into account, on the one
in  knowledge  and
hand, 
improvements with regard to health and welfare and, on the other, the potential
risks. In this regard, the precautionary principle must be respected.

the  beneficial  effects  arising  from  advances 

6

2.13  The  third  level  of  ethical  assessment  is  up  against  the  complexity  and
unforeseeability  of  all  the  possible  uses  and  consequences  of  the  results  of
research.  This is all the more difficult in that it is bound up with conceptions of
the  future  of  society  in  general.  This  ethical  assessment  is  therefore  more  a
subject for public debate and for national and Community socio-political bodies.

2.14  The  five-yearly  assessment  of  the  research  framework  programmes  should
include  an  ethical  component.  This  should  involve  taking  stock  of  how  the
ethical assessment of research projects was applied, and should inform the public
on  the  way  the  fundamental  ethical  principles  have  been  respected  in  the
implementation of the programme.

2.15  Research ethics should oblige researchers to abide by a code of conduct entailing
rigour  and  intellectual  probity  both  with  regard  to  defining  and  conducting
research  projects  and  in  relation  to  the  presentation  and  interpretation  of  the
results  of  research  (including  when  these  results  are  negative  and  even  where
there are commercial pressures on research).

2.16 

In order to be conducted competently, an ethical assessment of research needs to
be  supported  by  research  in  bioethics.    This  type  of  research  and  more  widely,
social sciences research should continue to be encouraged at Community level.

2.17  Research in bioethics should cover issues in the fields of animal research, food

and environment as well as in the biomedical field.

2.18  The analysis of ethical questions on controversial and publicly debated research
issues  should  be  encouraged  even  on  practices  such  as  e.g.  the  germline  gene
therapy, which are excluded from funding under the Framework Programme.

2.19  Studies  at  Community 

interaction  between  research  and
the 
development  on  the  one  hand  of  society  on  the  other  (dialogue  between  the
scientific  community,  public  perception  of  research  and  new  technologies,  role
of the media,...) should be strengthened.

level  on 

2.20  Research  in  bioethics  in  so  far  as  it  helps  to  identify  a  specifically  European
ethical approach, should contribute to the establishment of European citizenship.

2.21  The European Commission should set up a regularly updated information system
concerning all the ethical and legal data related to Life Sciences at both national
and international levels.

2.22  The  Commission  must  ensure  that  links  are  established  with  national  ethics
committees and similar national bodies in the Member States and in this context
should associate itself with the efforts of cooperation carried out by international
organisations (such as the Council of Europe and UNESCO).

2.23 

Information  and  education  about  the  new  technologies  and  their  social  and
ethical impact should be expanded, in particular in secondary schools, in order to
educate  European  citizens  to  participate  fully  in  the  public  debate  on  the
important ethical questions and on the resulting choices of society.

Having  regard  to  the  request  of  the  Commission  of  23  September  1993  for  an
Opinion on gene therapy;

Having  regard  to  the  Treaty  of  European  Union  and  in  particular  articles  129,
129A adn Article F.2 of the Common Provisions;

Having regard to the European Regulations in particular the Council Directives on
genetically modified (micro) organisms 90/219/EEC and 90/220/EEC and relevant
product legislation;

Taking  account  of  the  statements  expressed  by  the  European  institutions,  the
Council  of  Europe,  the  UNESCO  and  other  international  or  national  ethics
committees;

Having heard the report on "Ethical Aspects of Gene Therapy" by the rapporteur
Prof. Luis Archer;

considering that:

1.1

1.2

Scientists generally agree that somatic gene therapy is one of the most promising
ways of allowing to alleviate, to cure or to prevent a growing number of genetic
as well  as  acquired  diseases,  including  cancer  and  even  perhaps  AIDS.  Somatic
gene  therapy  has  indeed  recently  entered  the  clinical  setting  as  a  highly
experimental therapeutic procedure.  An important and long lasting research effort
is  still  required  before  routinely  performed  medical  applications  can  be
envisaged.

As  somatic  gene  therapy  is  highly  experimental,  the  ethical  principles  to  be
respected  are  at  the  very  least  all  those  applying  to  good  clinical  practice
concerning  research  involving  human  subjects  (namely,  informed  consent  of  the
patients with special care for children and incapacited persons, review of research
protocols  by  an  independant  and  multidisciplinary  body,  such  as  an  ethics
committee,  proportionality  of  risks  and  benefits,  confidentiality,  etc…).    In  this
respect,  there  is,  concerning  gene  therapy,  a  tendency  in  many  countries  to
reinforce the initial action of local committees by national supervisory bodies.

1.7

Specific  regulations  concerning  genetically  modified  organisms  (directives
90/219/EEC and 90/220/EEC as well as product legislation) have been adopted to
fulfill  safety  requirements.    These  regulations  do  apply  to  certain  research  and
development  aspects  relevant  to  gene  therapy,  but  not  to  clinical  trials  in  the
context of gene therapy.

At its present stage, gene therapy focusses on serious diseases for which there is
no  other  effective  available  treatment.  In  the  future,  therapeutic  indications  may
be widened.

Somatic gene therapy has not only short tem, but also individual and social long
term  consequences.  Its  cost  is  at  present  high  but  could  become  much  lower  in
the future.    In  this  respect,  I  should  also  be  in  mind  that  rare  diseases  are  of
little interest  for  pharmaceutical  industry  compared  to  more  frequent  diseases.
Both these points raise the problem of equal access to treatment.

As  somatic  gene  therapy  applications  are  in  the  long  term  bound  to  be  quite
important,  the  use of  new  therapeutical  products  will  be  of  great  interest  for  the
development of European Union biotechnological  industry.  Public control  of the
production  and  distribution  processes  is  already  exercised  in  some  European
countries and will be influenced by the recently established European Agency for
the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.

Germ line gene therapy, which implies the attempt to cure or prevent tansmission
to  future  generations  of  gene  defects  resulting  in  serious  diseases,  raises
considerable  and  controversial  ethical  problems.  Although  many  discussions  are
already going on in various  fora, the scientific  basis  and  the technical  feasibility
of germ  line  gene  therapy  are  far  from  being  established.  The  possible
transmission of the modification to future generations raises specific philosophical
questions.  Therefore,  no  proposal  for clinical  experimentation  of  germ  line  gene
therapy on humans is at present even contemplated.

1.8

There  are  high  expectations  raised  by  the  propsect  of  treating  or  preventing
serious and  widespread  diseases.  The  public  has  often  either 
too  high
expectations or needless concerns.

2.1

2.2

2.3

Somatic  gene  therapy  should  be  encouraged  at  different  necessary  levels  (basic
research, clinical trials, biotechnology), by supporting research actions (especially
at  European  level  by  means  of  the  Community  Research  Programmes  in
Biomedicine and Health, involving also research on bioethics), organizing training
and  exchange  programmes  for  researchers  and  students,  and  by  any  other
appropriate means.

The  ethical  evaluation  of  somatic  gene  therapy  protocols  requires  processes
assuring  quality, 
this  evaluation  without
introducing  any  unnecessary  delays  to  the  treatment  of  patients.  In  addition  to
local  review  systems,  a  national  supervisory  body  is  important  to  evaluate  as
thoroughly as possible this experimental technology.

transparency  and  efficiency  of 

The  harmonization  and  partial  standardization  of  all  European  evaluation
processes could be helpful especially for research carried out at European level.

To  consider  the  specific  problems  linked  to  the  use  of  genetically  modified
orgnisms  in  the  context  of  gene  therapy  implies  a  national  or  even  European
control of clinical trials. Relevant regulations for this purpose could be elaborated
at a European level.

2.8

Because of its present risk assessment, somatic gene therapy should be restricted
to serious  diseases for  which there  is no other  effective  available  treatment. The
widening  to  other  possible  therapeutical  indications  could  be  considered,
indication by  indication,  with  an  evaluation  of  the  medical  as  well  as  ethical
aspects.

Appropriate  measures  should  be  taken  to  assure  equal  access  to  gene  therapy
within the European Union. In addition, according to this equal access principle, a
special status could be attributed at European level to orphan drugs and diseases
as  already  done  within  the  Biomedical  and  Health  Research  Programme  of  the
European Commission.

To  guarantee  transparency  and  to  fulfill  the  objectives  of  the  European
construction  by  involving  the  citizens,  special  regulations  should  provide  for
evaluation at European level of the risks and results of gene therapy  technology.
The  conclusions  of  this  evaluation  must  be  regularly  published  to  allow  public
scrutiny and encourage public debate.

Because  of  the  important  controversial  and  unprecedent  questions  raised  by
germline  therapy,  and  considering  the  actual  stae  of  the  art,  germ  line  gene
therapy on humans is not at the present time ethically acceptable.

It  is  vital  importance  that,  simultaneously,  public  information  and  education  are
promoted,  so  that  the  public  gains  an  objective  and  correct  picture  of  the
possibilities and limitations of gene therapy and related developments. The issue
of gene  therapy  requires  a  didactic  as  well  as  a  democratic  approach,  involving
a close participation of European citizens.

In  accordance  with  its  terms  of  reference,  the  Group  of  Advisers  on  the  Ethical
Implications of Biotechnology hereby presents this Opinion to the European Commission.

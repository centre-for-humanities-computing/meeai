Blood  is  an  integral  component  of  the  human  organism  and  can,  as  such,  be
donated  to  patients.    Its  unique  feature  is  that  the  same  donor  can  give  blood
repeatedly  over  a  considerable  number  of  years.    Blood  carries  cellular  and  non-
cellular  components  throughout  the  vascular  system.  It  consists  of  red  and  white
cells, platelets and plasma.  The major proteins are albumin, immunoglobulins and
coagulating  factors  which,  in  conjunction  with  platelets,  repair  lesions  to  the
vascular walls. Blood cells and a variety of plasma proteins are extensively used in
modern medical therapy and prophylaxis.

Directive 89/381/EEC extends the scope of Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC
on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative
action relating to proprietary medicinal products and lays down special provisions
for medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma.  It entered into
force  on  1  January  1992;  six  Member  States  (Denmark,  Greece,  Ireland,  Italy,
Portugal and the United Kingdom) have notified national measures transposing it.

The Directive pursues the following objectives:

*

*

*

to encourage the self-sufficiency or the Community through
voluntary unpaid blood and plasma donation;
to introduce strict criteria guaranteeing the quality, safety and
efficacy of medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma,
notably to avoid viral contamination;
to harmonize conditions for authorizing the manufacture of blood-
based products.

The  Directive  does  no  apply  to  whole  blood,  plasma  or  blood  cells  of  human
origin, or to blood donation and transfusion activities, except where aspects of the
production of medicinal products from blood are concerned.

It  should  be  noted  that  blood  donation  is  now  considered  an  old  fashioned
methodology and significant ameliorations are expected in the future.  Production
of factor  B by  genetic  engineering  is  already  available  and  should  be  encouraged
further. Other developments will make products from human blood less necessary.

Opinion  n(cid:176)   28  (blood  transfusion),  issued  on  2  December  1991  by  the  French
National Ethical Committee, considers  that the  Directive  treats  blood  and  plasma
as a "starting material" ("matière première" in French corresponds more closely to
"raw  material"  in  English"  and  blood  derivatives  as  medicinal  products,  thus
making them seem to be tradeable goods, contrary to the principle that the human
body is not marketable and contrary to human dignity.

The  Commission  does  not  accept  this.  Since  1965  the  Community  definition  of
medicinal products given in Article 1 of Directive 65/65/EEC has applied to blood
products.  It  reads:  "any  substance  of  combination  of  substances  presented  for
treating or preventing disease in human beings...".

The problem is thus purely terminological.

When the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was detected among blood donors
in 1980 or thereabouts, hemophiliacs were faced with the new fatal risk of AIDS.
The  finding  of  a  link  between  seropositive  hemophiliacs  and  blood  plasma
donations  was  first  shown  in  1983.  At  the  end  of  1985  most  fractionation
laboratories  had  introduced  a  system  of  deactivating  HIV  by  heat  treatment.  By
then a large number of hemophiliacs had been infected. Unluckily there was a brief
period  around  1985  when  hemophiliacs  were  still  being  infected  as  business
interests dictated the further use of old techniques.

Blood is an organ of body and should be treated as such. This should include the
concept  of  human  dignity.  The  donor  should  be  protected  against  to  him  or  her
unfavourable results of blood or plasma donation. This can be more easily achieved
when blood donation is volontary and unpaid.

Those  who  give  blood  for  money  may  not  be  motivated  by  wholly  idealistic
considerations;  poverty  may  play  a  role,  for  one  thing.  Excessively  frequent
plasmapheresis can render the subject vulnerable to infection and even  provoke  a
state of malnutrition.

There are pathogenic risks in human blood. Several diseases can be transmitted by
blood: AIDS, hepatitis, syphilis, malaria and toxoplasmosis are among them.    On
the safety front, Directive  89/381/EEC  lays  down  stringent  rules  to  guarantee  the
quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  products  derived  from  blood,  through  the  proper
validation of manufacturing and purification processes and examination of donors.
The  Directive  makes  the  measures  adopted  by  the  Council  of  Europe  and  the
World Health Organization on the selection and testing of donors mandatory in the
community.

Respect for the individual (right to life, to physical integrity and to human dignity),
wheter as donor or  as  donee,  is  at  the  foundation  of  the  ethical  principle  that  the
human body in general and human blood in particular are not marketable.

Two points flow from this:

*

*

blood donations should be voluntary, unpaid and anonymous;

nobody should be allowed to make a profit from a donor’s blood. If 

blood is used for the manufacture of derivatives, neither the supplier
nor the manufacturer should be allowed to charge more than the 
actual costs incurred.

In  general  terms,  a  shortage  of  blood  supplies  is  ethically  unacceptable.  Blood
should be used more economically in order to arrive to a level of self-sufficiency as
fast as possible.

National and Community self-sufficiency helps to reduce the risk of spreading non-
endemic diseases such as malaria in the Member States and  makes quality controls
easier. Article 3 of the Directive requires the Member States to take the necessary
measures  to  promote  Community  self-sufficiency.  In  cases  of  blood  importation
from third countries, the authorization process should include requirements for the
blood importation for products derived from human blood.

The Group has scrutinized Directive 89/381/EEC on products derived from human
blood and human plasma.  It has concluded that it is sound.

It has also discussed recent developments in the field and in particular the Opinion
given  by  the  French  National  Ethical  Committee  on  the  Directive  and  on  the
contaminated blood affair.

Following its discussion, and having regard to the suggestions made by the French
Committee, the Group of Advisers on the Ethics of Biotechnology is of the opinion
that :

(cid:22)(cid:17)(cid:20)

The following ethical principles should be stressed in the Directive:

*
*
*

the donee’s health (availability and quality of blood supplies);
the donor’s human dignity (anonymity, voluntary donations);
non-marketability of the human body (donations to be unpaid).

Apart  from  the  obvious  payments  that  are  acceptable  for  administrative
purposes and industrial developments, no one should have additional profits
from  blood  donations  that  contradict  the  principle  of  non-marketability  of
human body.

(cid:22)(cid:17)(cid:23)

The  expression  "medicinal  products"  as  applied  to  products  derived  from
blood, should  not be  rejected as  these  products are  used  as  therapeuticals,
and  this  term  gives  a  guarantee  of  quality  to  the  products  through  the
authorization process related to medical products.

All  the  guarantees  as  to  the  safety,  quality  and  efficacy  of  medicinal
products should be applied in relation to products derived from blood.

All the proceedings related to blood donation should rest with organizations
submitted to public control which are able to ensure a maximum guarantee
with respect to the quality of the products.

The Group intends  to  deal separately  with the problem of an adequate  compensation  to  the
victims of medicinal products derived from human blood.

In  accordance  with  its  terms  of  reference,  the  Group  of  Advisers  on  the  Ethics  of
Biotechnology hereby presents this Opinion to the Commission.
